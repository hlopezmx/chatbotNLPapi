CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Um well this is the kick-off meeting for our our project . 
UNKNOWN Um and um this is just what we're gonna be doing over the next twenty five minutes . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um so first of all , just to kind of make sure that we all know each other , I'm Laura and I'm the project manager . 
UNKNOWN Do you want to introduce yourself again ? 
CONFIRMATION Great . 
UNKNOWN Hi , I'm David and I'm supposed to be an industrial designer . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN And I'm Andrew and I'm uh our marketing expert . 
UNKNOWN Um I'm Craig and I'm User Interface . 
CONFIRMATION Great . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um so we're designing a new remote control and um Oh I have to record who's here actually . 
UNKNOWN So that's David , Andrew and Craig , isn't it ? 
UNKNOWN And you all arrived on time . 
UNKNOWN Um yeah so des uh design a new remote control . 
UNKNOWN Um , as you can see it's supposed to be original , trendy and user friendly . 
UNKNOWN Um so that's kind of our our brief , as it were . 
UNKNOWN Um and so there are three different stages to the design . 
UNKNOWN Um I'm not really sure what what you guys have already received um in your emails . 
UNKNOWN What did you get ? 
UNKNOWN Um , I just got the project announcement about what the project is . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Designing a remote control . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN That's about it , didn't get anything else . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , that's that's it . 
UNKNOWN Is that what everybody got ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Did you get the same thing ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN So we're gonna have like individual work and then a meeting about it . 
UNKNOWN And repeat that process three times . 
UNKNOWN Um and at this point we get try out the whiteboard over there . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN So uh you get to drawyour favourite animal and sum up your favourite characteristics of it . 
UNKNOWN So who would like to go first ? 
UNKNOWN I will go . 
CONFIRMATION That's fine . 
CONFIRMATION Very good . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
UNKNOWN So This one here , right ? 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Very nice . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
UNKNOWN My favourite animal is like A beagle . 
UNKNOWN Um charac favourite characteristics of it ? 
UNKNOWN Is that right ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh , right , well basically um high priority for any animal for me is that they be willing to take a lot of physical affection from their family . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And , yeah that they have lots of personality and uh be fit and in robust good health . 
UNKNOWN So this is blue . 
UNKNOWN Blue beagle . 
UNKNOWN My family's beagle . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
CONFIRMATION Lovely . 
UNKNOWN Well , my favourite animal would be a monkey . 
UNKNOWN Then they're small cute and furry , and uh when planet of the apes becomes real , I'm gonna be up there with them . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
CONFIRMATION Cool . 
UNKNOWN There's too much gear . 
UNKNOWN You can take as long over this as you like , because we haven't got an awful lot to discuss . 
UNKNOWN Ok oh we do we do . 
UNKNOWN Don't feel like you're in a rush , anyway . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN I coulda told you a whole lot more about beagles . 
UNKNOWN Ach why not We might have to get you up again then . 
UNKNOWN Boy , let me tell you . 
UNKNOWN I don't know what mine is . 
UNKNOWN I'm gonna have to think on the spot now . 
UNKNOWN Impressionist . 
UNKNOWN Can't draw. 
UNKNOWN Is that a whale ? 
CONFUSION Um . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um , well anyway , I don't know , it's just the first animal I can think off the top of my head . 
CONFUSION Um . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN Big reason is 'cause I'm allergic to most animals . 
UNKNOWN Allergic to animal fur , so um fish was a natural choice . 
UNKNOWN Ah . 
UNKNOWN Um , yeah , and I kind of like whales . 
UNKNOWN They come in and go eat everything in sight . 
UNKNOWN And they're quite harmless and mild and interesting . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN God , I still don't know what I'm gonna write about . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Superb sketch, by the way . 
UNKNOWN Tail's a bit big , I think . 
UNKNOWN I was gonna choose a dog as well . 
UNKNOWN But I'll just drawa different kind of dog . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN M my favourite animal is my own dog at home . 
UNKNOWN Um That doesn't really look like him , actually . 
UNKNOWN He looks more like a pig , actually . 
CONFIRMATION Ah well . 
UNKNOWN I see a dog in there . 
UNKNOWN Do you ? 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN Oh that's very good of you . 
UNKNOWN Now I see a rooster . 
CONFUSION Uh . 
UNKNOWN What kind is it ? 
UNKNOWN Um he's a mixture of uh various things . 
UNKNOWN Um and what do I like about him , um That's just to suggest that his tail wags . 
UNKNOWN Um he's very friendly and cheery and always pleased to see you , and very kind of affectionate and um uh and he's quite quite wee as well so you know he can doesn't take up too much space . 
UNKNOWN Um and uh And he does a funny thing where he chases his tail as well , which is quite amusing , so It is . 
UNKNOWN Is he aware that th it's his own cha tail he's chasing ? 
UNKNOWN I think it is . 
UNKNOWN He only does it after he's had his dinner and um he'll just all of a sudden just get up and start chasing his tail 'round the living room . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN It's an after dinner dog then . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , so uh Yeah , maybe . 
UNKNOWN Probably when he was little he got lots of attention for doing it and has forever been conditioned . 
CONFUSION Maybe . 
UNKNOWN Right , um where did you find this ? 
UNKNOWN Just down here ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um what are we doing next ? 
CONFUSION Uh um . 
UNKNOWN Okay , uh we now need to discuss the project finance . 
UNKNOWN Um so according to the brief um we're gonna be selling this remote control for twenty five Euro , um and we're aiming to make fifty million Euro . 
UNKNOWN Um so we're gonna be selling this on an international scale . 
UNKNOWN And uh we don't want it to cost any more than uh twelve fifty Euros , so fifty percent of the selling price . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN Um , can we just go over that again ? 
CONFIRMATION Sure . 
UNKNOWN Uh , so bas at twel Alright , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So cost like production cost is twelve fifty , but selling price is is that wholesale or retail ? 
UNKNOWN All together . 
UNKNOWN Like on the shelf . 
CONFUSION Um I dunno . 
UNKNOWN I imagine That's a good question . 
UNKNOWN Our sale our sale anyway . 
UNKNOWN I imagine it probably is our sale actually because it's probably up to the the um the retailer to uh sell it for whatever price they want . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , okay okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFUSION Um . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
UNKNOWN But I I don't know , I mean do you think the fact that it's going to be sold internationally will have a bearing on how we design it at all ? 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN Think it will ? 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFUSION Um . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Well right away I'm wondering if there's um th th uh , like with D_V_D_ players , if there are zones . 
UNKNOWN Oh yeah , regions and stuff , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um f frequencies or something um as well as uh characters , um different uh keypad styles and s symbols . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well for a remote control , do you think that will be I suppose it's depends on how complicated our remote control is . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN I don't know . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It does make sense from maybe the design point of view 'cause you have more complicated characters like European languages , then you need more buttons . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So , possibly . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN And then a and then al the other thing international is on top of the price . 
UNKNOWN I'm thinking the price might might appeal to a certain market in one region , whereas in another it'll be different , so Just a chara just a characteristic of the Just Or just like , basic product podi positioning , the twenty five Euro remote control might be a big hit in London , might not be such a big hit in Greece , who knows , something like that , yeah . 
UNKNOWN What , just like in terms of like the wealth of the country ? 
UNKNOWN Like how much money people have to spend on things like ? 
UNKNOWN Aye , I see what you mean , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Marketing . 
UNKNOWN Good marketing thoughts . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN Oh gosh , I should be writing all this down . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Right away I'm making some kind of assumptions about what what information we're given here , thinking , 'kay trendy probably means something other than just basic , something other than just standard . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um so I'm wondering right away , is selling twenty five Euros , is that sort of the thi is this gonna to be like the premium product kinda thing or Uh-huh . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Like how much does , you know , a remote control cost . 
UNKNOWN Well twenty five Euro , I mean that's um that's about like eighteen pounds or something , isn't it ? 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Or no , is it as much as that ? 
UNKNOWN Sixteen seventeen eighteen pounds . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I'd say so , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um , I dunno , I've never bought a remote control , so I don't know how how good a remote control that would get you . 
NEGATION No . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN But yeah , I suppose it has to look kind of cool and gimmicky . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um right , okay . 
UNKNOWN Let me just scoot on ahead here . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um well d Does anybody have anything to add to uh to the finance issue at all ? 
UNKNOWN Do we have any other background information on like how that compares to other other Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Thin No , actually . 
UNKNOWN That would be useful , though , wouldn't it , if you knew like what your money would get you now . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , interesting thing about discussing um production of a remote control for me is that l as you point out , I just don't think of remote controls as somethin something people consciously assess in their purchasing habits . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah . 
UNKNOWN It's just like getting shoelaces with shoes or something . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN It just comes along . 
UNKNOWN Five minutes to end of meeting . 
CONFIRMATION Oh , okay . 
UNKNOWN We're a bit behind . 
UNKNOWN Do you know what I mean ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Like so sort of like how do you I I mean one one way of looking at it would be , well the people producing television sets , maybe they have to buy remote controls . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Or another way is maybe people who have T_V_ sets are really fed up with their remote control and they really want a better one or something . 
UNKNOWN I know um My parents went out and bought um remote controls because um they got fed up of having four or five different remote controls for each things the house . 
CONFIRMATION But Right . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN So um for them it was just how many devices control . 
UNKNOWN Okay so Right , so in function one of the priorities might be to combine as many uses I think so . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Right , so do you think that should be like a main design aim of our remote control d you know , do your your satellite and your regular telly and your V_C_R_ and everything ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well like um , maybe what we could use is a sort of like a example of a successful other piece technology is palm palm pilots . 
UNKNOWN They're gone from being just like little sort of scribble boards to cameras , M_P_ three players , telephones , everything , agenda. 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So , like , I wonder if we might add something new to the to the remote control market , such as the lighting in your house , or um Yeah , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Or even like , you know , notesabout um what you wanna watch . 
UNKNOWN Like you might put in there oh I want to watch such and such and look a Oh that's a good idea . 
CONFIRMATION An Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So extra functionalities . 
UNKNOWN Like , p personally for me , at home I've I've combined the um the audio video of my television set and my D_V_D_ player and my C_D_ player . 
UNKNOWN So they w all work actually function together but I have different remote controls for each of them . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So it's sort of ironic that that then they're in there um you know , the sound and everything it's just one system . 
UNKNOWN But each one's got its own little part . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um okay , uh I'd wel we're gonna have to wrap up pretty quickly in the next couple of minutes . 
UNKNOWN Um I'll just check we've nothing else . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um so anything else anybody wants to add about what they don't like about remote controls they've used , what they would really like to be part of this new one at all ? 
UNKNOWN And you keep losing them . 
UNKNOWN You keep losing them . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Finding them is really a pain , you know . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN I mean it's usually quite small , or when you want it right , it slipped behind the couch or it's kicked under the table . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN W You get those ones where you can , if you like , whistle or make a really high pitched noise they beep . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN You know . 
UNKNOWN That's just really good id Yep . 
UNKNOWN There I mean is that something we'd want to include , do you think ? 
CONFIRMATION Uh , sure . 
CONFUSION Dunno . 
CONFUSION Okay maybe . 
UNKNOWN I remember when the first remote control my my family had was on a cable . 
UNKNOWN Actually had a cable between it and the T_V_ and big like buttons that sort of like , like on a blender or something . 
UNKNOWN My goodness . 
UNKNOWN And um , you know , when I think about what they are now , it's better , but actually it's still kind of , I dunno , like a massive junky thing on the table . 
UNKNOWN Still feels quite primitive . 
UNKNOWN Maybe we could think about how , could be more , you know , streamlined . 
UNKNOWN Maybe like a touch screen or something ? 
UNKNOWN S Something like that , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Or whatever would be technologically reasonable . 
UNKNOWN Uh-huh , okay . 
UNKNOWN Well I guess that's up to our industrial designer . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause it could b it could it could be that f it could be that functionally that doesn't make it any better , but that just the appeal of of not having You know , these days there's a r pe things in people's homes are becoming more and more like chic , you know . 
UNKNOWN It looks better . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um , nicer materials and might be be worth exploring anyway . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFUSION Uh . 
UNKNOWN Right , well um so just to wrap up , the next meeting's gonna be in thirty minutes . 
UNKNOWN So that's about um about ten to twelve by my watch . 
UNKNOWN Um so inbetween now and then , um as the industrial designer , you're gonna be working on you know the actual working design of it so y you know what you're doing there . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN Um for user interface , technical functions , I guess that's you know like what we've been talking about , what it'll actually do . 
UNKNOWN Um and uh marketing executive , you'll be just thinking about what it actually what , you know , what requirements it has to has to fulfil and you'll all get instructions emailed to you , I guess . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , so it's th the functional design stage is next , I guess . 
UNKNOWN And uh and that's the end of the meeting . 
UNKNOWN So I got that little message a lot sooner than I thought I would , so Mm-hmm . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Before we wrap up , just to make sure we're all on the same pagehere , um , do we We were given sort of an example of a coffee machine or something , right ? 
UNKNOWN Uh-huh , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Well , um are we at ma right now on the assumption that our television remote control may have features which go beyond the television ? 
UNKNOWN Or are we keeping sort of like a a design commitment to television features ? 
UNKNOWN Th Okay , well just very quickly 'cause this we're supposed to finish now . 
UNKNOWN I I don't know . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN Um I guess that's up to us , I mean you probably want some kind of unique selling point of it , so um , you know Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , sure . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN I think one factor would be production cost . 
CONFIRMATION Okay , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Because there's a cap there , so um depends on how much you can cram into that price . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFUSION Um . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think that that's the main factor . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Right , okay , we'll that's that's the end of the meeting , then . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN So , uh thank you all for coming . 
CONFIRMATION Cool . 
UNKNOWN Is that alright now ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFUSION Sorry ? 
UNKNOWN Okay , everybody all set to start the meeting ? 
UNKNOWN Okay , we've got half an hour for this one um to uh discuss the um functional design . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Thanks . 
UNKNOWN All ready to go ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um so hopefully you've all been working away , and I've put the minutesof the last meeting in the project folder . 
UNKNOWN Um so I guess just to to recap on uh what we did last time . 
UNKNOWN Um kind of uh got to know each other a little bit and uh got familiar with all the equipment and started to discuss um a bit about the project , you know , cost-wise how much how much money we had to s Um just want to tell you that you have three new requirements , um which is the The first one is that um uh the company's decided that teletext is outdated uh because of how popular the internet is . 
UNKNOWN Nobody uses teletext very much anymore , so we don't really need to consider that in the functionality of the of the remote control . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN Um they've also suggested that we um we only use the remote control to control the television , not the V_C_R_ , D_V_D_ or anything else . 
UNKNOWN I think the worry is that if the project becomes too complex then it'll affect um how long it takes us to get it into into production , the time to market . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So um , we're just gonna keep it simple and it'll just control the T_V_ . 
UNKNOWN And the other thing was that the company want the corporate colour and slogan to be implemented in the new design . 
UNKNOWN Um I'm not entirely sure what the corporate colour is . 
UNKNOWN It might be yellow , because there seems to be a lot of yellow everywhere . 
UNKNOWN And the slogan , like the actual written slogan , or just to embody the idea of the slogan ? 
UNKNOWN Well that's the thing , I'm I'm not sure um uh th because on the the company website , uh what does it say Uh something Yeah , I mean do they Is that something they want actually written on it , 'cause it's quite long . 
UNKNOWN 'Bout putting the fashion in electronics . 
UNKNOWN Mm yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um or yeah , just the idea , but I'm not sure . 
UNKNOWN So that's something we can discuss as well . 
UNKNOWN So those are the three things , just not to worry about teletext , uh only control the T_V_ , and um and uh incorporate the uh colour and slogan of the company . 
UNKNOWN Um so is everybody okay with any of that , or do you want me to recap at all ? 
UNKNOWN Nope , we're all set . 
UNKNOWN Right um , time for presentationsthen . 
UNKNOWN Who would like to go first ? 
UNKNOWN I'll go first . 
CONFIRMATION Sure . 
CONFIRMATION Okay , cool . 
UNKNOWN Alright um , can I st steal this from the back of your laptop ? 
UNKNOWN Oh yeah , of course , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh so this is the technical functions design . 
UNKNOWN G go on ahead . 
UNKNOWN Um Right to do the um the design I have I've had a look online , I've had a look at the homepage , which has given us um some insp inspiration from previous products . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um I've had a look at the previous products to see what they offer and um I would like to ask you guys for um your ideas about the design at the end of the meeting . 
UNKNOWN Um unfortunately we're not allowed to talk outside the meeting room , so Um , having a look at the existing products , I found out that um it tends to come in sort of two extremes , there's either um a very complicated one that's got lots of buttons , lots of colours , very confusing , you don't know what you're doing . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um in that case the the labelling tends to be very bad . 
UNKNOWN Um there's an example I'll show you at the end , um sh show you now . 
UNKNOWN Uh here um the button there and there . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
UNKNOWN This one's prog . 
UNKNOWN Sorry . 
UNKNOWN That one's perg and that one's prog , and it doesn't really tell you what it does . 
UNKNOWN Um , not sure if you had a a look at the other um control in that example . 
UNKNOWN Um it's a very simple one . 
UNKNOWN It's got only the basic functions mm but um it's the same size as the the hard to use one . 
UNKNOWN Oop . 
UNKNOWN Uh it looked a bit clunky . 
UNKNOWN They're very big and not very much use for buttons . 
UNKNOWN Um , and it's just very hard to access the advanced functions . 
UNKNOWN There's there's nothing for instance for a slow motion button . 
UNKNOWN Um , my own preferences , I prefer the the clunky one . 
UNKNOWN Um it's very easy to use . 
UNKNOWN Um but unfortunately it does lack the advanced functions which I I quite like having on the controls . 
UNKNOWN Um so I believe the the advanced functions should maybe be hidden in a drawer , or something like tha from the bottom of it . 
UNKNOWN So , now I'd like to ask for your preferences . 
UNKNOWN Um not sure of how long we've got , uh Um , the clunky one is the one on the right . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Well we can chat away for uh for five minutes or so I think at at most . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Just a couple of minutes anyway . 
UNKNOWN M yeah , like a lot of a lot of what I've um read and prepared for this meeting fits in really closely with what with what Craig's just gone over . 
UNKNOWN So in part I could I could give you some of my personal preferences but I could also th add some to this which is just about sort of um sort of market research . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN But anyway , um we might come to that later . 
UNKNOWN Shall we sh well we'll stick to kind of your area for now . 
UNKNOWN Which which is the clunky one , the one on left or on the right?. . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um clunky in what sense , like um h heavier ? 
UNKNOWN Larger ? 
UNKNOWN Um I think it's supposed to be the same size , but um it's got much fewer buttons . 
UNKNOWN It's , you know , it's very spread out and kind of you know , I get the idea it'd be sort of about this size . 
UNKNOWN I see , so it's more just basic . 
UNKNOWN Looks kind of Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Right , okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN got very few buttons on it and Um , do we have any functions that um we'd want on it ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Sure . 
UNKNOWN Well I think it's a valid point . 
UNKNOWN I mean like the one on the left looks quite um quite complicated , and that P_R_T_ p P_R_O_T_ thing is incredibly confusing . 
UNKNOWN Um so I see I see why yo you know you might prefer the simpler design , but yeah you don't want to lose out on , you know , what it does , so maybe you know you know you get a lot of remote controls where you kind of flip the thing open , I think that's a good idea . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN I think it's a good idea . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN I mean so far I've got um on and off , um switch the channel up and down , and put the volume up and down . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Uh-huh . 
UNKNOWN Um they're just the the very basics you could use for a T_V_ . 
UNKNOWN Uh-huh , and then actual numbers for channels as well , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um , you say that's a h a required one or a requested one ? 
UNKNOWN Which was that ? 
UNKNOWN Would you like um the channels like the the numbers on thing , um Um , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Up the numbers , or the up down ? 
UNKNOWN God , I wou I would say that's required , I mean there's no way anybody's gonna buy a remote control these days when if you can't actually individually select channels , I mean would anybody disagree with that ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um , what else , uh So don't need to worry about teletext , don't need to worry about V_C_R_ , uh any kind of like display controls at all do you think we need to worry about , you know like brightness and contrast ? 
UNKNOWN We don't ? 
UNKNOWN No ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well I think I think es essentially what we're doing right now is we're categorising . 
UNKNOWN We're saying well we want this to be a product that offers all the sort of more tricky features but we want them to be in another area ? 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Is that right ? 
UNKNOWN Is that what we're we're doing ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN We're kind of like sorting them an Or are we actually eliminating things we just don't want the product to have ? 
UNKNOWN Um Uh , to start with um sort of a bit both , um we need to find out exactly what we have to have um and after that we can add things if they're possible . 
UNKNOWN I think are you are you maybe kind of thinking what we absolutely have to have and what would be nice ? 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Okay , right . 
UNKNOWN Well , do you wanna maybe just , at this point decide on what we absolutely must have as a p as a function of this . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN Um , so so far , just to recap you've got volume and channel control and Right okay . 
UNKNOWN There's um on and off , um volume and channel , and skip to certain channels with the numbers . 
UNKNOWN Um Mm-hmm yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well , one one way I would look at this um would be that we a approach the different controls in terms of um like control types , so that for the user it's very clear what they want to do where they go . 
UNKNOWN Uh and also think maybe a little bit about sorta w w what would just wanna be acc easily accessible . 
UNKNOWN For example if we had audio controls , those could be something people set up very rarely . 
UNKNOWN Oka Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Maybe they're un they're they're they're in a little area but covered up um , things like channel and volume um are used all the time , so we just have them right out on top , um very just very sort of self-explanatory . 
UNKNOWN Um so maybe we need to think about having three or more groupings of controls , you know like one which are just the the habitual ones that should be right within your natural grip . 
UNKNOWN And others that are uh also available and then others that are concealed . 
UNKNOWN Something like that . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Uh well , just to to wrap up quickly on this this little section Have I just lost Oh no . 
UNKNOWN Um , uh do you think maybe that's the only kind of uh essential requirements , and then maybe just things that would be nice if it could do would be things like audio set up and display set up and things like that , maybe like a mute button , that sort of thing . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Any of you anything to add to that at all ? 
NEGATION No . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN I'll add it later , I guess the presentation. 
UNKNOWN Okay , right . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um okay , if we can move on to next presentationthen please . 
CONFIRMATION Sure . 
UNKNOWN Um Do you wanna Probably not , actually . 
UNKNOWN Do you want to switch places ? 
UNKNOWN Can this can this pl reach ? 
UNKNOWN Can this plug come across ? 
NEGATION No . 
NEGATION No . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN So why don't I just pick up and move then . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Here , I'll just Why don't I just Mm er , can you go up behind me ? 
UNKNOWN Just just switch them . 
UNKNOWN Kinda This is so This I'm all in a knot now . 
UNKNOWN bit complicated . 
UNKNOWN It'd be nice if everything was wireless , wouldn't it ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN So I can I can say already , I dunno whether this is for good or for bad but there'll be a lot of kind of uh redundancy in the in the the issues and the the uh the things . 
UNKNOWN Oh , like overlap between what you said ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Oh well , for all you know that that'll happen . 
UNKNOWN Which is ma not necessarily a bad thing , but may what I've already started doing is cr I created a slidein in my presentationhere so um so that we kind of think well what's the cumulative effect of what we've taken from your ideas and and mine , because certainly I I have a hard time separating separating things completely . 
UNKNOWN Obviously obviously what you've just told me what you've just told me impacts a lot on what um like market research mm that that I've been So how do I how do I get this up ? 
UNKNOWN Mm hard to know what where your role ends , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um function F_ eight . 
UNKNOWN Uh pr yeah , press function and F_ eight , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
UNKNOWN So F_ eight ? 
UNKNOWN Function , the blue button . 
UNKNOWN Next to the control on the left . 
UNKNOWN Oh , and F_ eight . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN You have to push it together . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN Okay , I think that that's doing it now . 
UNKNOWN Nope . 
UNKNOWN Try that again . 
UNKNOWN Uh , again ? 
UNKNOWN Think maybe the the wire in the back might be loose . 
CONFUSION Wait .
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , you wanna Oh oh here we go . 
UNKNOWN Um , okay great . 
UNKNOWN Yep , there we go . 
UNKNOWN There you go . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Just um Before I bring this up what I'll just say is um what I've what I've done is tried to collect some information so that I can then relay this to to you guys so that it's now becomes a collective thing . 
UNKNOWN And then kind of lead us in the direction of deciding , 'kay what what are our options , what should we decide and do you know what I mean , so . 
UNKNOWN Increase that 'cause we can't see the That's much better . 
UNKNOWN Um Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Can you um Right , okay . 
UNKNOWN There you go . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
UNKNOWN That would be Okay . 
UNKNOWN So um does that make sense ? 
UNKNOWN So what I basically got is I just looked into some information and sort of th tried to think about how how we could review it and how we could and what kind of decisions we could take away from it and then maybe by the end of just looking at some of these things we can think about what are our priorities . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause certainly there's lots of different information to go through . 
UNKNOWN So um I'm thinking here about uh primarily about customer needs , that we start with the customer , and w you know , what they want and what are issues with with um existing products . 
UNKNOWN Uh to think about trends and also about try and connect that as you see with the company vision which is about fashion in electronics . 
UNKNOWN Um and then , as I say uh w we'd like to prioritise our design features from this and um Dunno . 
UNKNOWN Bouncing on top . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN So this is what I've found here , um a lot of this is new to me , so we'll just read through together . 
UNKNOWN Um , users dislike the look and feel of current remote controls . 
UNKNOWN So they find them ugly . 
UNKNOWN Most people find them ugly . 
UNKNOWN Um the vast majority would spend more money for it to look fancy as well , we'll see later , the vast majority would spend more money for um slightly more intuitive control , such as voice recognition . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Okay I'm gonna we'll look at that in a second . 
UNKNOWN Um most people use only a f a very slim portion of all the controls . 
UNKNOWN So I guess what we're looking at here is people want this h technology , they tend to use the most simple controls and overall they find remote controls to be something they don't doesn't really appeal to them . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So I think what we're doing is we're trying to take like if for me this is sorta like three different different um inspirations , you know , one is that we want uh something that's high-tech but we want it to seem easy . 
UNKNOWN And in spite of the primitive side of it and the very high-tech side , we want it to just be an appealing piece of equipment in people's hands . 
UNKNOWN Um , frustrations . 
UNKNOWN They get lost a lot , s as it came up in our last meeting . 
UNKNOWN Um , takes time to learn how to use them . 
UNKNOWN This is uh why I mention when Craig was uh showing us some ideas that we actually try and group controls , so d it doesn't just look like a big panel , kinda like when you you look at , you know , a new computer keyboard , or something that is quite explanatory . 
UNKNOWN If you want audio , if you want visual , then you have those . 
UNKNOWN Um and I will admit I don't know what R_S_I_ stands for . 
UNKNOWN Repetitive strain injury . 
UNKNOWN Is installing a new remote control something that people Um , I think it'll be the mid range to the high end market , in terms of people . 
UNKNOWN Uh , no , that did not come up at all . 
UNKNOWN Um so here here is another um sort of a a review here of the main things . 
UNKNOWN I also found that most people would uh adults at least would pay more for voice recognition . 
UNKNOWN Now apparently we do have access to all the tech cutting edge technology in remote control . 
UNKNOWN So I dunno if that's possible we might consider getting into it . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN And and again here as we sort of move m sort of thin start thinking about how we wanna sell and market this , I think a recurring theme here is the company wants it to be wants us to make something that's fashionable and sleek and trendy . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um people uh additionally aren't aren't liking the appearance of their products , so we wanna think about as we take all the sort of the techie features how we can um put that into a unit which is which people like . 
UNKNOWN You know , they like the aesthetics and the ergonomics . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So want something that looks good and is easy to use , big priorities . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , so you know just c looking at what what Craig um Craig's i uh ideas are s sorta tell me that maybe what we wanna do is try and um separate the different things that we wanna include in this . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So if we do say well we want there to be all the technology will we try and make that almost be like optional technology . 
UNKNOWN You know , it's like like I find a lot of T_V_s these days , something really like about 'em is if you wanna just turn 'em on and off you can , but they have little panels where you click and there's just like tons of features you go through . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN So it you wanna group all the different kind of types of functions together , you know . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN That's I think it's a good idea . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN That's s that's sort of the um But I I'm my hope here is that I'm putting out this information so that we can then say okay , well how do we collectively move on with it . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um I I haven't brought out one specific marketing idea , although my sense is that what we should try and think about is what are the current trends in materials and shapes and styles , and then use that . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN But not let that confine us technologically . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So Alright ? 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Any um comments on all of that ? 
UNKNOWN Well , um one of the things that we have to decide on by the end of the meeting is who we're gonna be um who's our our target audience , our target market . 
UNKNOWN That's uh Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um , so if we want something that that looks good and is easy to use , but has y is fairly powerful product , whatever , who do we really want to aim that at ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN I mean Yeah , who wou who would have the money to spend . 
UNKNOWN Where's the money , maybe . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well i if if like twenty five Euro is our is our selling price then you can imagine , well I don't I'm not really sure how much that will retail at . 
UNKNOWN And who watches T_V_ . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN But you want it's somebody who's not gonna just use the remote that comes with their telly , I suppose , they're gonna actually go out and buy one . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So , who do you think we're aiming this at ? 
UNKNOWN 'Cause twenty five Euros for a remote , how much is that lo locally in pounds ? 
UNKNOWN It's about sixteen , seventeen pounds , I think . 
UNKNOWN Is that too is that a lot of money to buy an extra remote or a replacement remote ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , okay . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Um so maybe not the high end range , but maybe middle , middle up-ish . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Kind of . 
UNKNOWN You know how much ? 
UNKNOWN I dunno I guess you pay , what , ten ten quid for a remote ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Like a simple replacement , right . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I mean if you lost your remote and the first thing you just wanna go out and get , would you how much would you pay ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN This this kinda touches on your comments there , David . 
UNKNOWN These are the age groups which we have information on and these are this is a table of h what people would pay more for a certain feature . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Just gives us a rough idea of where the w the will to spend money on T_V_ equipment is . 
UNKNOWN Okay Okay . 
UNKNOWN Mostly focused around the twenty five age group . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , so do you think we're we're aiming at a fairly young market then ? 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN Sort of young professional , kind of . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , okay . 
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm Uh , yeah , it's the Yep . 
UNKNOWN Um Well , did you not say it was the the adults that were going for the the voice recognition ? 
UNKNOWN Um do you think then uh voice recognition is something we should really seriously consider ? 
UNKNOWN What what do you think , Craig ? 
UNKNOWN Sort of the the older group . 
UNKNOWN Uh f Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It does it does fit with the market that we're sort of identifying , in terms of Okay . 
UNKNOWN N yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think we are gonna have to narrow it down , to say let's target these people and give them what they want and 'cause you know , there needs to be some kind of selling point to it . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Sure . 
CONFIRMATION Sure . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So um anybody anything there to add Just kind of young professionals , uh th like if we are going to include speech recognition , it's kind of between fifteen and thirty five seems to be like a really high response to that . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So we could say that was our target . 
UNKNOWN I I think twenty five to thirty five is is is fair to add that in as a group as well because that's more than half your group of people who are willing to at least try and use your technology . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so fifteen to thirty five , look fairly young . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN You know , they have bit of expendable income to spend on this sort of thing . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN I think perhaps that age group is significant as well because those are people who use the computer , who are familiar with their with computers in in their everyday work . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN I think people who are maybe about I wouldn't say thirty five , but people who are about forty-ish and above now would not be so dependent and reliant on a computer or a mobile phone or something like that . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN But yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , sure . 
UNKNOWN So Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So these are people who are gadgety , right ? 
UNKNOWN People who are u growing up used to , you know in schools and in universities , when you go on to their working lives , people who would you know regular Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So they'll not sh not shy away from something quite high-tech . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN That that's that's a good point . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Um okay , so um so shall we make the decision uh to include speech recognition if we can . 
UNKNOWN If we can . 
UNKNOWN I I think one thing we should try not to avoid is not to say we have to use speech recognition right now , because um , based on what you've go y everybody's saying , right , you want something simple . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Why is that ? 
UNKNOWN You want basic stuff and you want something that's easy to use . 
UNKNOWN Speech recognition might not be the simplest thing for somebody to use . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Could it be an on off thing ? 
UNKNOWN Um , but what I'm saying is that we're we're trying to lock ourselves into a s particular kind of technology , rather than focusing on on exactly what are the features that we're gonna say , and then , you know , say speech recognition is good for this , speech recognition is not good for this . 
UNKNOWN Like if you want it on Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Where you can activate it and deactivate it ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Sure . 
CONFIRMATION Sure . 
UNKNOWN So maybe we should I suggest that we think about speech recognition , anyway it's a it's something that can be used to fulfil a function , but at end of the day we don't look at the technology , but we look at the function first . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Sure . 
UNKNOWN Uh-huh . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Sure . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN Uh okay , well do you wanna um give us your presentationand then then we can I don't know um might have been a good idea to all deliver our presentationsand then discuss , but this is this is how we're Yeah , exactly , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay , sure . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , it's good well it's good to get ideas out while they're fresh in mind . 
UNKNOWN Um Not Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Oh it's something that's just occurred to me as well is if we make it um speech reco if we incorporate speech recognition , that's appealing to people um maybe with a physical disability as well . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN And not losing . 
UNKNOWN And also it helps in terms of people not losing this , you know they they're saying oh it's I lose it in the couch . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN like we're kind of what we're b sort of getting in into here is mating different uh design features together that they Right . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN I reckon one problem with speech recognition is um I've actually seen one of them used and uh the technology that was in that one wasn't particularly amazing , so you end up yelling at the control for hours . 
UNKNOWN Really ? 
UNKNOWN Channel up . 
UNKNOWN Oh really , you've seen one before . 
UNKNOWN Do you think maybe we need like further advances in that kind of area until it's worthwhile incorporating it though ? 
UNKNOWN Um I think it'd probably quite expensive to put in . 
UNKNOWN Sorry , do you mind passing me my notepad. 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Course not . 
CONFIRMATION Thanks . 
UNKNOWN Cool , um . 
UNKNOWN There you go . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFUSION Um . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Well this is just the working design um . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Well this is just what how I would go about it . 
UNKNOWN Um I guess I try to define like what we're doing now , try to define what we're trying to get done . 
UNKNOWN Um I think in a practical way , we kind of know what it is . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN We've used it , we're familiar with it , but we're we can't n we haven't narrowed down um exactly what the things we're trying to fulfil , like Besides the basics , I think back in the back of our minds we know what the basics are . 
UNKNOWN Has to change channels , has to change volume , but in like specifics , right , which one of the basics are you trying to target . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um are there certain parts of the basics that are more important or less important than the basics ? 
UNKNOWN Um and I just the idea is just to get everybody to um I usually have a have have a design that's there as a basic , so , you know , things that to start everything going . 
UNKNOWN But I guess everybody does have some idea , so I don't think um there's a need for that . 
UNKNOWN Um okay this finding things is a little bit confusing , so I'll go into the diagramfirst . 
UNKNOWN It just explains how the process goes through , from a from the basic technology point of view , the basic steps that you need um in the diagramand in this slideprobably works better . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um okay , you need some power source . 
UNKNOWN 'Kay , a battery or something , to keep it going . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um and that power source is important because it ties you down to um how long the device will last . 
UNKNOWN Uh-huh . 
UNKNOWN Um it ties you down perhaps a bit later on in terms of the technologies um how far you can transmit the signal or the complexity of the functions that you want . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Like for example , voice recognition , right . 
UNKNOWN That might be constrained because that you might need to power a microphone , you might need to power other things , so that's one perhaps constraint there . 
UNKNOWN Um Th Okay , the basic thing is there's a user interface where people punch a button or talk into it or smile to it or blink their eyes , whatever . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN You know , and that um picks up an input from a user , um uh a logic a series of logic has to decide what the user is telling the device , and the device has to r you know , based on you push button A_ , so I will do something with button A_ . 
UNKNOWN So maybe button A_ is the power button , okay . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um and then it needs to be able to send the signal out to the device itself which is the receiver here . 
UNKNOWN Um and I think that's about it in terms of my design um . 
UNKNOWN It's fairly general , um and I guess the purpose of this is also not to restrict you in in the way you're thinking , like um voice recognition , right , um , if it's something which is important then we just add more power rather than having a thing that we don't have enough power . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So it's not really a constraint in that sense , but I mean these are functionally , you know , the base , what the technology has to do . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um so I guess the rest of it I think we should maybe you you wanna go back to what the functions are ? 
UNKNOWN I think that's more relevant to a discussion ? 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
CONFUSION Uh . 
UNKNOWN Well , do you wan do you wanna finish up your your whole presentationthen ? 
CONFIRMATION Sure . 
CONFIRMATION Sure . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , w I'm done . 
UNKNOWN Are you are you all done ? 
UNKNOWN More or less . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Ps Oh , it's just putting the rest of it into words , but it's essentially the same thing . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Um you have a transmitter , an input device , logic chip , you know , stuff like that . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Um I guess this would be Yep . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN And like on the means b Since we're on the topic of the technology , uh are there any like what are our options ? 
UNKNOWN Alright , what's what i in Is this the only way that we go about it , or are there other thin Right . 
UNKNOWN Um , these these aren't technology options in that sense . 
UNKNOWN This is just um a basic principles and basic components that are needed . 
UNKNOWN The basic principle of 'Kay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN For example , if you needed um if you needed to add uh a voice recognition , right , then your user interface would be split , broken down into more components , right , which you have a microphone , the V_R_ and stuff like that . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
SURPRISE Oh .
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So this just show how we're kind of modularising the whole thing . 
UNKNOWN Uh Yep . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN So each component represents one function , but I think the basic functions are the logic , the transmitter , um and the receiver , okay , and the power are things that you won't have to care about . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um and those are things that based on what your user interface requires then we'll add more functionality to it . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um there might be one other consideration which would be that the the transmission between the remote control and the T_V_ for example . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Okay , um are we gonna restrict ourselves to using the traditional technologies of infra-red thing ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Because that's something you need to actually be physically be pointing to . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Well well a worry that was was expressed in the new requirements was that if we made this too complex it would e it would effect um how long how long it took us to get this to market , so I th suspect it might be a good idea just to restrict our kind of our creative influence on this on the user interface and not worry so much about uh how we transmit it um because I mean it it's tried and tested intra-red , so we could stay with tha Mm-hmm Oh , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN There might be one other problem with the transmission , um in particular right now , since we're talking about voice recognition . 
UNKNOWN Um if somebody's gonna h talk to the device , you ideally want them to hold it to them . 
UNKNOWN I it you may not require that , but you know , um it's it's it's something very natural , I guess , you know , to hold it , to signal to the user , and push a button maybe to start s talking about it . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Yeah , mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Then you need to send the signal out , so because if you're using infra-red , the line of sight um say the T_V_'s at that chair , and I'm standing in front of here and the transmitter is here , it blocks it . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So in that sense , there's not really a restriction but it's something which you may have to think about later on in the process . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Not so much further down . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN And um just a clarification before we finish this . 
UNKNOWN Uh does c is our controller is it have the option of being um on a standard uh frequency as all of the other equipment , so that the one controller can control several pieces of equipment ? 
UNKNOWN There's there's not much specific specific information , but I think that um one indication of infra-red mean that you're just targeting traditional devices . 
UNKNOWN W Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Because infra-red is something which everybody has . 
UNKNOWN W Well well we've um In the new requirement spec they said just to focus on the T_V_ , so that's what we should do for now I think . 
UNKNOWN Just to T_V_ , okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Something I was wondering about was the power . 
UNKNOWN Um , is it worth considering like having like a charging unit as opposed to just regular batteries ? 
UNKNOWN I mean is that something we really want to go into , do you think , or should we just consider running on regular batteries ? 
UNKNOWN There's a there's Okay , from from a from a component point of view there's added complexity , and you add cost to it , um and then there's probably the fact that you need another physical component . 
UNKNOWN Uh-huh . 
UNKNOWN Uh-huh . 
UNKNOWN You need a docking cradle , for example , for you to put it in to charge . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Or you need to get the user to plug it in . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um and most users are very f use already used to the idea of buying batteries and putting it into the controller . 
UNKNOWN But unless the controller's gonna consume a lot of batteries , like he's gonna run through like twenty batteries a month , then I don't think rechargeable is something we should you know , we really need to care about . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so just stick to to regular Okay . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Um , right . 
UNKNOWN So basically the um I'm just gonna just recap uh what I said at the start , was that um the the whole point of this meeting was to f absolutely finalise who we're gonna aim this at , and what exactly the product's gonna do . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So um just to recap on Are we all happy about the idea of um aiming the product at um the fifteen to thirty five bracket ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's good . 
UNKNOWN Um and also the funct the the actual functions of what it's gonna do . 
UNKNOWN Do you wanna recap on that , Craig ? 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN I think we just say that it was gonna be the the most basic stuff possible . 
UNKNOWN Um on off , up and down channels , up and down volume and uh skip to a channel . 
UNKNOWN Okay , right . 
UNKNOWN Ta . 
UNKNOWN And is it going to include any of the uh the more advanced features , or are we gonna eliminate those ? 
UNKNOWN Um I think we include mute , but apart from that um I think we just we'll go for the simpleness . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Okay , I think Another thing that you were saying about categorising the controls ? 
UNKNOWN R is it is it is it s is it not an option still that we include some things just as a sort of under like sort of under a door or some 'Cause what what I'm I'd be a bit worried about is if someone was h had previously developed habits of expecting to control surround sound or this and that with their controller and then and then they , you know , w they get ours and w it's doesn't have that . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , it's as optional functions . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I dunno if that'd be a problem . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um maybe I could suggest we we break them down into three simple categories . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN One would be audio controls , one would be video controls , and the other one would be a device . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um this may not mapvery well to advanced functionality especially , but I think that um from a manufacturer's point of view , from a person designing the device , but I think from a point of view of a person using the device , you know a T_V_ is something they see and something they hear , um it's something they do other things to like turn it on and turn it off . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I mean like so what we could have is like three buckets , right , where we could throw things into , like if we want this feature , let's throw it into there , and then from there decide whether it's basic , or it's non-basic . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN 'Kay , okay . 
UNKNOWN I mean it might help with the visualisation . 
UNKNOWN Like that . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN And it would actually help with the component build as well . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Okay , right . 
UNKNOWN Mm okay , great . 
UNKNOWN Um , okay well I gotta kind of got five minutes to wrap up now . 
UNKNOWN Um next thing we're doing is having lunch . 
UNKNOWN Whoohoo . 
UNKNOWN Um and then we're gonna have thirty minutes of working on the next stage . 
UNKNOWN Um so I'll be putting the minutesof this uh this meeting into the project documentsfolder . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um so uh I guess just to just to confirm that we know what we're doing in the next well in the thirty minutes after lunch anyway , um for uh our Industrial Designer , you're gonna be thinking about the components concept . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um User Interface Designer gonna be thinking about our user interface , and marketing you're gonna be thinking about trend watching . 
UNKNOWN Um and you'll all get specific instructions as well . 
UNKNOWN So um I dunno , just just to to ask now if you've got anything else you've thought about while we've been talking . 
UNKNOWN Um , do you wanna start with David . 
UNKNOWN Anything else to say at all ? 
UNKNOWN Mm no , not really . 
UNKNOWN No , okay . 
UNKNOWN Um yeah , just I just wanted to ask then before we wrap up , shall we agree for sake of um sort of clarity and when we when we r resume that we'll u use this idea David's proposed , where we think of these three sort of buckets and anything anything we discuss about them is sort of , okay , we're talking about this . 
UNKNOWN Andrew ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah I think that's definitely a good idea . 
UNKNOWN Uh-huh . 
UNKNOWN Shall we do that , then ? 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay , great . 
UNKNOWN Um just about the three buckets , um what would go in the the device functions one ? 
UNKNOWN Um things like on off . 
UNKNOWN Because they don't have anything to do with what you see . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I me mean in terms of picture and the entertainment value , you know , um so um And channel . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN And and channel . 
UNKNOWN Um Could you plug me in ? 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Because the on off also goes , you know , like on off like power , not on off sound . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Not on off video . 
UNKNOWN Although you don't turn off the video on your T_V_ , but um you might wanna you know turn off the sound , say you wanna pick up the phone , there's a mute button , right , so you you have you have a choice of putting it on to um others or a device . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Device is basically anything which we can't categorise , right . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so you're gonna have um audio which is gonna be like you know your bass settings and actual volume hi Okay . 
UNKNOWN We put it out . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , anything to do with what you hear , right . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN You you put that into audio . 
UNKNOWN Okay , and then visual Okay , so brightness , contrast , things like that , and then just actual device things , like what channel you're watching , turning on an off , stuff like that . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN And then video is anything that you can see . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFUSION Um . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN Colour , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
CONFIRMATION Sure . 
CONFIRMATION Sure . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Okay , um Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN And then k I suppose quite likely what would happen is in the d device category there might be some which are just like the habitual standard and then others which are maybe a bit more Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Like random which we have no other place to put , but we need it somewhere there . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Sure , okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um even even if it doesn't mapvery clearly what happens is that people at least have some in their mind . 
UNKNOWN It's easy to use , I think that's one thing that um and I guess from the component point of view it's easy to build as well 'cause things are like fixed . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um so yeah , I guess just things to think about are you know like the fact it's gotta look good , because of who we're we're , you know , targeting this at . 
UNKNOWN Um something maybe kind of quirky in design maybe . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Make it kind of ergonomic kind of to hold , you know , things like that . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um , so I guess I guess that's it . 
CONFIRMATION Great . 
UNKNOWN That's the meeting over . 
UNKNOWN Whoohoo . 
UNKNOWN Then we get to go find out what was picked up for lunch for us . 
UNKNOWN 'S to do now is to decide how to fulfil what your stuff is , so in that sense so it does kind of make sense , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , sure . 
UNKNOWN Okay , well Okay . 
UNKNOWN It kinda does make sense , doesn't it , because when we get into the end of meeting we're kind of talking about action and design as opposed to background . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN Everything I have is kinda background . 
UNKNOWN Okay we all ready to go ? 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN Well how um on the in this meeting then if we um I'll just just recap on the minutesfrom the last meeting . 
UNKNOWN And we uh decided on decided on our our target group being fifteen to thirty five , and we decided that it was gonna be non-rechargeable battery-powered , that we're gonna group our audio-visual and other functions into into those categories , um . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN And I told you guys about the three new requirements about ignoring teletext , ignoring everything except the T_V_ , and trying to incorporate the the uh corporate colour and slogan . 
UNKNOWN Um so that was the last meeting . 
UNKNOWN Is there anything have I forgotten anything ? 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN Uh that sounds . 
UNKNOWN Is that everything ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um so if we have the three presentations, and then if you have anything to kind of that you know you're gonna want to discuss , maybe just make a note of it , and we'll have all the discussion at the end . 
UNKNOWN That might be a better idea this time . 
CONFIRMATION Sure . 
UNKNOWN And so if we start off uh with Andrew and then Craig and then David , if that's alright . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Sure . 
UNKNOWN Um and then after that we'll have to make some decisions about stuff , right . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , cool . 
UNKNOWN So if you wanna take this . 
UNKNOWN Why don't I get that ? 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Screwed in quite tightly . 
UNKNOWN Uh what did uh how did we leave it with speech recognition now ? 
UNKNOWN We did we say we were gonna try maybe incorporate it but we hadn't made a definite decision on that ? 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Oh I should also point out that um the you know the kind of final objective of this meeting is to reach a decision on the concepts of the product . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So um that's kind of the end result hopefully . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um alright so c is it function F_ eight ? 
UNKNOWN Uh-huh . 
UNKNOWN Hopefully appear in a wee second . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Come on . 
UNKNOWN I think it's working . 
UNKNOWN Up there we go . 
UNKNOWN Okay great s so let me just start this . 
UNKNOWN Okay great . 
UNKNOWN So um uh s move on . 
UNKNOWN Uh-huh oh where'd it all go ? 
UNKNOWN It's not good . 
UNKNOWN Oh no . 
UNKNOWN Okay lemme just see where I can find it . 
UNKNOWN This looks more like it . 
UNKNOWN I think I just opened up the template . 
UNKNOWN Sorry about that . 
UNKNOWN Oh right . 
UNKNOWN Okay alright so let's have a look here . 
UNKNOWN Okay so this was the method that um I've taken . 
UNKNOWN Here we go . 
UNKNOWN Uh basically what I wanna do here , before we get into it uh too far , is I want to show you all the background information I have that I think we need to acknowledge if we want this to be successful . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN And uh and then sorta g go through some of the way that I've dealt with that information , and then sort of bring us all together into it to see sorta see how this fits in with the overall vision . 
UNKNOWN Um so I've tried to take a whole lot of market research and summarise it for us , and then ide identify uh trends that are are sort of in sync and are important to our our uh p project plan that we have so far , and then uh initiate a kind of discussion on design options so that it sorta helps us to to narrow in on on aspects that will inform other uh other elements of the of the project . 
UNKNOWN Does that make sense , tha that sort of strategy ? 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN I thought that that will impact on the rest of what we do , so that's why I suggested we get in this . 
UNKNOWN Aye a fair point definitely . 
UNKNOWN Okay so out of um different uh figures and ratings ob uh of people in general , um consumers in general , the number one thing that was found was that uh the br t television remote control , a fancy look and feel , okay , and not , it specified , not a functional look or or feel , uh b f f fancy . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um however , this is where we kinda have to be very , I think , creative about it . 
UNKNOWN Number two was that it be innovative . 
UNKNOWN Okay so that tells me that we have to find a way to be innovative without a adding just unnecessary um sort of functional bits to it . 
UNKNOWN Uh and third priority uh for ease of use , so again that kind of gives us a general picture of how it has to be , um quite user friendly while still having technology . 
UNKNOWN So it I'll just say right away as a bit of a foreshadowing into how we proceed with this in terms of m marketing , is that I think um what we should think about is how the um about how the innovation uh contributes to the look and feel , and not so much to the functionality of it . 
UNKNOWN For example like when you pick it up and push it like it all lights up or something , you know what I mean , like , or it's got something else to it that just seems innovative because obviously the thing that the message here is ease of use . 
UNKNOWN Aye right . 
UNKNOWN Uh-huh . 
UNKNOWN So how do you make innovation make something more more easy to use ? 
UNKNOWN Well that's I guess where we're gonna go with this . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Okay then there's the other aspect of the back the the market um research I have here is on fashion style , okay , which as we've agreed is a priority . 
UNKNOWN Uh top European fashion trend um that I read about says there's this emerging theme of fruit and vegetables , okay , especially in clothes and furniture . 
UNKNOWN And when I first saw that I thought hmm , well do we want to actually try and think about this trend and how we add something to it , or we get right into it , or we completely steer away from it , do you know what I mean ? 
UNKNOWN Okay okay . 
UNKNOWN So my my feeling is that we w do want to observe this trend , but we want to think also about the fact that it sort of has to fit in with something which is not specifically electronics . 
UNKNOWN Um 'cause I think what we're in what we're in is partly sort of home decor , partly something like a computer , um so I think we might wanna be careful about how you know how quickly we create like a remote control in the shape of an apple or something , I think that would be pushing it . 
UNKNOWN And then in terms of m material trends are for things to be soft and spongy and sort of , you might say ergonomic or or friendly to handle , which is which also in indicated that last year this was this was not the case . 
UNKNOWN So um probably a lot of the competition on the market will be still in last year's mode , so if we try and really capitalise on that , I think that'll be in our favour . 
UNKNOWN Um So these this is the summary of everything . 
UNKNOWN Um style is number one uh thing in the in the market of who we're selling to . 
UNKNOWN Uh innovative design technology's also a must in that it's seen it'd be seen to be uh cutting edge , uh but ease of use t has to be insured throughout . 
UNKNOWN That was like the number three thing . 
UNKNOWN And then at the end there are vibrant natural colours um that's the way I interpreted it anyway , softness in materials , shape , and function , and so I've written at written at the bottom to give us sort of a context of discussion , Mac iPods , something which is , I'd have to say very high-tech , ten gigabytes , whatever , but when you hold it in your hand there's like no buttons . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN You know what a Mac iPod is ? 
UNKNOWN Mm that's true , yeah . 
UNKNOWN I'm thinking however Mac iPod is sort of last year's because it's very hard and sort of glassy and glossy , so I'm thinking if we imagine that we're taking some of the features of a Mac iPod and we're then making it s more of like a more of like a comfortable type of or more of like a maybe more vibrant to friendly thing to have . 
UNKNOWN Um and then so this is w with all that information what I'm what I'm suggesting in this slidehere is that we we take these ideas , and as we get into more the more um techni like sort of production side of things , that we think about shape , materials , and themes or series that go throughout . 
UNKNOWN Sort of like a I dunno like um we think of some kind of a thin theme that unifies it all , that we agree on , uh sorta like a marketing identity . 
UNKNOWN Um Does that make sense ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So so like I threw out a few ideas there just to kinda get us thinking along those lines like lemon , lime , I dunno , green colours , pe whatever , it's just an idea , 'cause I'm thinking that some of these ideas will seem quite coherent if we use them in terms of their what people associate this them with in terms of texture , shape , colours , things like that . 
UNKNOWN Mm 'kay . 
CONFIRMATION Great . 
UNKNOWN Like um the ones the ones which I'm most fond of in terms of giving like a theme to it would be like um like lemon or something like that , you know something which is , like you see a lot in in other areas . 
UNKNOWN Like I see lots of websites and things that seem to associate with like lemon and lime and So anyway it's just just an idea . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I'm thinking maybe we could incorporate some of these features into a fairly um into something which is which seems to have something to it which is almost gimmicky because like um like something to do with like lighting within it . 
UNKNOWN Like you know just within the simple sense , when you pick up a phone and touch a button it uh lights up , q usually the buttons light up . 
UNKNOWN Ah . 
UNKNOWN How can we build on that ? 
UNKNOWN Maybe like it could light up in different colours or something or or people could buy the buy the control and then it comes with different like covers or something so . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Anyway those are that's all I have , but uh hopefully we can we can revisit those ideas when we get into Yep . 
UNKNOWN That's great . 
UNKNOWN Uh-huh . 
UNKNOWN Okay great . 
UNKNOWN Um thank you for that . 
UNKNOWN Uh Craig do you wanna uh plug yours in then ? 
UNKNOWN Is it working ? 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Not quite . 
UNKNOWN Did you press F_ eight ? 
UNKNOWN It's probably not sending . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Oh something coming now , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yep , there it is . 
UNKNOWN There we go . 
UNKNOWN And so think of this concept . 
UNKNOWN Um to research it I've um had a look on the the homepage again . 
UNKNOWN It's provided me with more examples of um previously existing c remote controls . 
UNKNOWN Um there's a wee bit of discussion about the other existing ones there , um so I've taken the um suggestions from them and tried to incorporate them into this um So then this we're looking for um suggestions on size th um size of control and the buttons , um the shape of the control , and whereabout the buttons should be located on the control . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Um what I found from the research is that most the current controls are just basically big bricks with loads of buttons all over them . 
UNKNOWN Um they're not very attractive to look at , and they're not very comfortable to hold , they're I just hold 'em like big bricks , and they're very easily lost . 
UNKNOWN Um they tend to be very dark colours , so if there are shadowy places down the side of couches you can't really see them . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um the the controls themselves tend to use a very inconsistent colour scheme . 
UNKNOWN Um for instance , the stand-by button isn't always red , uh it really should be . 
UNKNOWN It's uh something the user then uh identify with . 
UNKNOWN This is a red switch off , that's how it should be . 
UNKNOWN Um I'm not sure if there's any other examples of that , but something to look out for . 
UNKNOWN Um there's a problem that I've I've got couple of preferences for the the end control um I get 'em with the the red colour button for stand-by and s the other examples of that um The buttons should be large . 
UNKNOWN They shouldn't be tiny little things like you get on some mobile phones . 
UNKNOWN They should be easy to press , very comfortable . 
UNKNOWN Um one of the examples given on the homepage was um there's an up and down volume button but both of them have a V_ on them , so the up volume button looks like it should be a down volume button , that's kinda confusing . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um should avoid s things like that . 
UNKNOWN Um if the the corporate colour scheme allows it we should have a very bright colour so that it can be easily identified anywhere . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um obviously trying trying to avoid being tacky there , but it could um tie-in very easily with your your lime and lemon idea . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay , do we have a corporate colour scheme ? 
UNKNOWN I didn't know . 
UNKNOWN I think it's yellow because like the website is yellow and there's a band at the bottom is yellow , so yellow , lemon , you know definitely food for thought there , but keep going and we'll discuss it after . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN And the Play-Doh 's yellow . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Fantastic . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um any extra features we add beyond the basic ones should be m hidden , they shouldn't be on the um shouldn't be visible without something be opened or some sort of special extra effort . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um if we did decide to go for voice activation there sh should always be a button as alternative , possibly hidden in the the opened up section um making that something is wrong with it or with somebody's voice , maybe they got a cold or Um we should definitely avoid the big square block look . 
UNKNOWN That's just wrong . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Mm 'kay . 
UNKNOWN And um we got an emailuh from I think it's the the research department , and they've said th the voice control um can now talk back if you ask it a question . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN So it sh it could be good to have them um confirm any action you take and possibility . 
UNKNOWN Aye that's a good idea , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Right and these are problems I've had with it . 
UNKNOWN Um I don't know where the slogan should go , or really what the slogan is . 
UNKNOWN I think it's um , fashion into electronics . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And we don't know how flexible the colour scheme is . 
UNKNOWN I mean you say you wanted the the corporate colours , but they don't say you know if we can use any other colours at all or That's it . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Cool . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Great . 
UNKNOWN Lots of good information there . 
UNKNOWN Yeah that that was very good , and uh now with David . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Mm 'kay um . 
UNKNOWN I think I'm cool . 
UNKNOWN It's a shame the cable wasn't just in the middle of the table , huh ? 
UNKNOWN I know it'd be handy , wouldn't it . 
UNKNOWN Just um It takes a second , doesn't it ? 
UNKNOWN Oops . 
UNKNOWN Do y do you wanna sit in the the line of sight of this um Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah okay . 
UNKNOWN Let me just get this going first . 
UNKNOWN Ah there it is . 
UNKNOWN 'Kay , that should be it . 
UNKNOWN Okay um I guess the same thing again , I started with something very basic . 
UNKNOWN So just so you guys have some idea of what's involved in my process , um and then you can just work through it and we 'll either modify it or start from scratch um depending on what your needs are . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um the components are exactly the same . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um I think , like what you guys said , um the most input that's needed is basically in the user interface . 
UNKNOWN The rest of the components um they do have an impact in terms of cost and complexity . 
UNKNOWN Um like you said time to market was a problem , um and how many components are physically in there in cost . 
UNKNOWN And the power is basically a factor of that . 
UNKNOWN Um and the lower components , the power , the logic , the transmitter , and the infrared , um they affect you in terms of the size of your device , um and that would have some inte impact on how y I think more how you hold rather than um the actual use using the the remote control because um like we've said we've defined , like we only want the basic things that to be visible , and the rest of them we try to hide . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So um you know it's just a matter of working out space . 
UNKNOWN So I guess three things , um cost , um complexity , and the size . 
UNKNOWN These are the three things that um will have an impact on you . 
UNKNOWN So just go through it in the components . 
UNKNOWN Um these are the options that are available to you , um I'm not very sure about the voice thing 'cause I got another emailand it was in fact quite sketchy on what n the voice options are . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Um it said it could talk to you , but it never said anything about being able to listen . 
UNKNOWN I it said something about a sensor but never clarified that . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN So maybe if you well I could see the other emailthat they sent you , um 'cause they got back to me with like different requirements , or different offerings of what components availa Okay so your basic components are buttons , okay and you have a wheel available , like a mouse scroll wheel , okay there's an L_C_D_ display , um I think these are quite standard things . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN They're standard , aren't they ? 
UNKNOWN No um they're well in the sense that these are all the options available for you . 
UNKNOWN I'll explain to you the complexity and the cost thing again a bit later . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay um then there's um how the case actually looks . 
UNKNOWN It can actually be flat or it can be curved , um and then the different types of materials that you can use , um I don't think you can use them in a combination , um but um I could check back for you , but I don't think you can actually use them in a combination . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN We you couldn't have like plastic and rubber ? 
UNKNOWN Um I think plastic and rubber would be fine , but plastic , rubber , and wood , I wasn't I'm not very sure about the titanium . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN They had some restrictions on using the rubber and the titanium . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Mm 'kay . 
UNKNOWN Um the rubber was a restriction on the kind of power source you could use , but the titanium had a different kind of things on the shape of the thing , so I think that there is some restriction on um I think you could probably group plastic and rubber together , wood and titanium , but you know it might be easier from a cost perspective and a complexity just to use one . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN You know as opposed to two . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um and the other components are logic chips , um again I'll I'll go back to the component chips . 
UNKNOWN The com how complex or how easy the logic is , it depends on how many functions you have on the on the unit um and that impacts cost . 
UNKNOWN Um I don't think the logic chip has a issue about size 'cause they should be about the same size . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Power consumption should be about the same . 
UNKNOWN Um I think the main impact is complexity , um and the other thing is um the power options . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um the first one is a standard battery . 
UNKNOWN Okay the second one I think is more of a gimmick then actually a useable thing , it's a wind-up you know , a crank . 
UNKNOWN I'll clear one of these things for you . 
UNKNOWN Just by moving it yeah . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah but that that might be something I think that's more of a look and feel decision because I don't think you can have one power source if you're using the alternative power sources . 
UNKNOWN I think whatever it is you still need a battery 'cause I don't think anybody wants to keep doing one thing . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN Okay the other ones are a solar powered cell , which may not be a great idea in Europe or any country that has seasons 'cause half the year you'd be dead . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So like what I said , you probably need like a battery and something else . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um and the kinetic one I guess for me is the most interesting one because it's movement and people like to fiddle with their and it's a nice sales gimmick I think . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN From a marketing gimmick it it's a technology thing , it's a shake it it doesn't work , shake it , knock it or something . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN You know you know you have you had those balls , you know those stress balls where you bounce the ball and it and it lights up and it goes , you know that might be a gimmick combined with rubber . 
UNKNOWN W yeah . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Uh yeah yeah , I see . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN You know just to if you get frustrated wi remote control you can throw it , kind of you know just uh you know um so . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN I know what you mean yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um okay my from my role , I don't think that personal preferences but role preferences , I think um something comfortable to hold , um small and slim I guess that's more in the sense of small and slim in terms of comfortable not so small you can't , you know like a phone or something , too small phone . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um and the other thing is from a production point of view um the less components we use and the simpler the components means you reduce your cost and you increase your profit . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um and also the time to market and the complexity of developing designing and debugging it um so . 
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm mm-hmm mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um okay let me just go back and talk about some of the restrictions . 
UNKNOWN Um The user interface restrictions basically means that if you use more complicated features , like the buttons are standard okay , the L_C_D_ panel and the scroll wheel you need more complicated logic . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Um the case okay with a rubber case you can't have the solar panels . 
UNKNOWN Okay with the titanium case , let me just check that um , titanium case can't be curved , it has to be square . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Okay um there's no restriction on the plastic , and it can't be curved on the wood . 
UNKNOWN It can't be curved . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So that's again , I don't think you can use them in a combination , um especially the titanium I I suspect they're very fixed to a particular need . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN So um mixing them may not be a good idea um yep . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Right can I Yeah well yeah it's just I'm quite keen to get the discussion going with the time we've left so but yeah you c ask away . 
UNKNOWN That's it . 
UNKNOWN Uh question on can I ask a question ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Can we uh power a light in this ? 
UNKNOWN Can we get a strong enough battery to power a light ? 
UNKNOWN Um I think we could because the L_C_D_ panel requires power , and the L_C_D_ is a form of a light so that Are you thinking are you thinking of of a light in the sense of um a light light , or a light in the sense of it glows kind of you know Frankenstein , it's alive . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So maybe one of the things we can just try and include is a really good battery . 
UNKNOWN Why what kind of light do you want are you thinking of ? 
UNKNOWN Well I mean I'm thinking it might be That for uh this to be a high-tech thing it's gonna have to have something high-tech about it and that's gonna take battery power , and to make that to make that a realistic goal I think one of the issues that will come up later is , can the battery power it ? 
UNKNOWN Uh-huh . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Illuminate the buttons . 
UNKNOWN Yeah it glows . 
UNKNOWN Well m I'm thinking along the lines of you're you're in the dark watching a D_V_D_ and you um you find the thing in the dark and you go like this , and that's what everybody does . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Oh where's the volume button in the dark , and uh y you just touch it , or you just pick it up , and it lights up or something . 
UNKNOWN Yeah yeah yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Like a phone yeah , like the backlight in a phone . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Like a phone , yeah yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay cool . 
UNKNOWN Whereas with phones , people charge them once a week . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN We're gonna need to put in a really good battery so people don't have to charge their r remote control every few days . 
UNKNOWN Um that's why I think the option of the the kinetic thing which basically means as long as you shake it like a watch , like an automatic watch um it's probably sensitive enough when you fiddle it . 
UNKNOWN But are people gonna wanna shake their movie controller ? 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN So you could trigger that to a light , like I said the bouncing ball thing , or you could trigger that to use that to power the light as opposed to so when they pick it up , right , and then that that sorta triggers the glowingness . 
CONFIRMATION Sure . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Right okay um well let's just go right back to the marketing ideas for a start , and just giving an id idea on the time , we've got about fifteen minutes to play with at most . 
UNKNOWN Okay , great . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So um yeah so just t to bear in mind that the ultimate goal of this meeting is to reach an decision on the the the concepts of the product . 
UNKNOWN So back to your idea about um incorporating the idea of like fruit and veg , and the corporate colour , and things like that . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um I mean what does everybody think about Does anybody have any ideas of about how we can fit all that in together ? 
UNKNOWN I mean that's kind of the user interface type of thing , what are your thoughts on that ? 
UNKNOWN Um I think we could go for like um maybe not a p a fruit shape but a very sort of curvy type shape . 
UNKNOWN Um you could have the same sort of texture and colour as a fruit . 
UNKNOWN So maybe do y are we thinking something that like s could sit in your hand comfortably , or do you th you'd hold onto comfortably or So something quite curvy ? 
UNKNOWN Um probably something that s sits in your hand comfortably , sort of feels right in your hand . 
UNKNOWN Okay um right okay . 
UNKNOWN Colour-wise I mean you made a re uh was it you or uh I can't remember who made the point about how if you've a nice bright colour you'll not lose it , was that Whose about how if you have a bright colour you'll not lose it so much . 
UNKNOWN I think he made that . 
UNKNOWN What's that ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um and when the corporate colour is yellow , I mean maybe we could think about about the colour of the whole product being yellow I don't know . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um And then obviously the uh the materials when it has anybody got like an overall picture in their mind about what what might work ? 
UNKNOWN Well I mean I'm thinking that what we need to do is have something that kind of unifies a lot of the different concepts , and if we think that what we are w our number one marketing motive is um the look and feel . 
UNKNOWN That's all . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So for the look and feel to seem coherent and not just sorta bits and bits and pieces of of concept and technology or or whatever or fashion , then we should have it kind of come back to one thing that we kind of all sorta can visualize . 
UNKNOWN Um maybe what we could do is t th think about a concept which touches b back to the on the um the colour , you said company colour yellow . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN I mean if we think of something , like I was saying also lime and lemon you know , what can we come up with something where we we try and associate it with with like the series . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN We just come up with something like that we kind of use it as a theme to inspire the shapes and things . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Is there a particular shape that you're interested in ? 
UNKNOWN Like does marketing have any research on does it need to be long ? 
UNKNOWN Does it need with a square thing wha Yeah 'cause that will n help narrow down the choice of Like fruit . 
UNKNOWN Oh you know like in circular in shape or Choice of material yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause I I I was kinda thinking about as well you know how you get these shock resistant mobile phones , and they're plastic but then also have like rubber on the outside , and it kinda feels it feels kind of warmer to the touch . 
UNKNOWN I'm thinking fruits in my head , but that's tacky . 
UNKNOWN See I'm I'd quite like a sort of uh snowman type shape . 
UNKNOWN It feels a bit more comfortable , and maybe we could incorporate plastic and rubber into it . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And then then we could have curved shapes , 'cause wood or titanium , yeah , it's gonna have to be boxy and rectangular and I think we might be moving away from that you know so um Well I'm do we really want it in like the shape of a lemon or no I don't think we do either . 
UNKNOWN No no no not at all . 
UNKNOWN It's more more just that we we think about like what it is we're trying to achieve , so and then we have one one sorta theme that we stick with . 
UNKNOWN Do you know what I mean ? 
UNKNOWN Okay right well um so thoughts about the actual shape of the thing . 
UNKNOWN A snowman shape ? 
UNKNOWN Um so a p sort of larger bit sits in your hand , and then you got maybe another bubble at the top for just any other function you need . 
UNKNOWN Uh-huh . 
UNKNOWN That's quite a distinctive shape , that would be good wouldn't it . 
UNKNOWN Right , sure . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah so yeah should we go with that ? 
UNKNOWN Um can we yeah like to and wha like do you have a Can you like yeah just t we can visualize it . 
UNKNOWN Do you wanna drawit on the board ? 
UNKNOWN Um something like that um you got two groups there um maybe it could fold up and you get a third group inside or uh you have volume controls about there . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Ooh that'd be good . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN So call it the snowman-shape trademark . 
UNKNOWN Yeah that's cool . 
UNKNOWN Um and I mean colour-wise what does everybody think ? 
UNKNOWN I think it is quite important to get yellow in there somewhere . 
UNKNOWN I mean do you want the whole thing yellow , maybe like yellow and white do you want something Uh-huh . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN So I reckon it'd look quite nice if we just had um this here , had a sorta background yellow , and then have sort of a nice bold colour for the buttons . 
UNKNOWN Okay cool . 
UNKNOWN Um and also I mean how are we going to incorporate the slogan in ? 
UNKNOWN The fact that it talks to you , I mean it might be quite cool if when you first start using it it says , what is it , putting fashion into electronics or something , I dunno . 
UNKNOWN Or when you like or if you turn it off or something if it can speak if it could actually say the slogan it might be a bit more powerful than just having it written on it somewhere . 
UNKNOWN I think that might scare me . 
UNKNOWN I d I d any thoughts on that at all ? 
UNKNOWN I think that'd probably scare me . 
UNKNOWN You turn it on your control possessed s . 
UNKNOWN I know . 
UNKNOWN Um unless an a I mean if you also would that work if we wanted to incorporate um an L_C_D_ display , where would we put that ? 
UNKNOWN Would we put that on the inside or It's bound to increase the cost of it a lot , I would've thought . 
UNKNOWN Um Nah . 
UNKNOWN Do we need an L_C_D_ display ? 
UNKNOWN What what's the functionality of that ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah but the question is what are we using it what would we what would we achieve from it ? 
UNKNOWN What would it achieve ? 
UNKNOWN Putting in lights is cheap but putting in an L_C_D_ panel just to make it glow is a bit of a Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Well L_C_ well I'd when you used to mention the L_C_D_ I'd think I wonder what that would be about . 
UNKNOWN And the th the thing I could see it helping with would be if it was somehow connected with um listings . 
UNKNOWN So as you scroll through , 'cause we said we might have a jog dial , so as you scroll through your stations you can y it actually tells you what it is . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think that will be a problem because we don't have an input device to get the listings into it , so um it's a bit nuts to get the Monday Tuesday Wednesday you know . 
UNKNOWN Right , okay . 
UNKNOWN Mm oh yeah that's true . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So so no need for an L_C_D_ display ? 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um I I'm not saying there's no need for an L_C_D_ display , but um it's what's what what would it tell the user , 'cause the L_C_D_ tends to be an output as uh as opposed to an input so um does the remote control need to talk back to the user ? 
UNKNOWN I think that would make it very complex . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Mm not real Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN We have the option of the speaker as well the sa the same thing goes for the speaker , is there a need for the remote control to to talk back ? 
UNKNOWN I don't know if there is really , no um I would say no need for a talk-back . 
UNKNOWN Um You could put a game on it . 
UNKNOWN Uh does anybody disagree with that ? 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN No ? 
UNKNOWN Easy . 
UNKNOWN When the T_V_ dies you can play with the remote control . 
UNKNOWN Mm mm . 
UNKNOWN Okay um right so you're gonna have the three different sets of of functionalities , um I mean do you wanna group them into s head of the snowman , body of the snowman , inside of the snowman , is that what you're thinking ? 
UNKNOWN Um well I think the advanced ones the the ones you don't usually use could be hid inside . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN B um I think the we had were fairly basic ones , they'd have to go on the the front somewhere . 
UNKNOWN Okay right um what else do you need to talk about ? 
UNKNOWN Well i I was just Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Where would you physically position the buttons ? 
UNKNOWN Um I think that that has some impact on on on many things . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um Yeah I think so yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um maybe you wanna drawonto the Yep . 
UNKNOWN So I'm just gonna um pop this in here 'cause I have a slideabout decision making which I'd forgotten about . 
UNKNOWN Oh sh God we've got five minutes um okay uh back we go . 
UNKNOWN Um energy what do you think that's suggesting we're how we're powering the thing ? 
UNKNOWN I really like the idea of this kinetic thing where you'd have the back-up of the battery , but have have kinetic power , I mean what does anybody think about that ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , sure . 
UNKNOWN Um I've had kinetic things before , and the the the one issue we need to keep in mind with them is that you're committing the user to moving it , and watches yeah Sure , okay , right , okay . 
UNKNOWN No , like I said we have a h hybrid kind of thing , so it's not gonna charge the battery , it's just Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Support for it . 
UNKNOWN I mean just it's just worth pointing out because like I've I've known I've known people to have kinetic watches that they wear all the time , and it's just like magic because it's always powered and there's no battery . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN I've also known people to have things like like a jewellery watch they wear from time to time , and they eventually just say it's just too much of a nuisance because I don't wear it all the time . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN Like remote control is similar , you're away on vacation , I dunno whatever , you something , and it just starts to get worn down . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So we should think about Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well I suppose that if you're if you're away and you're not using it , then you're not using any power either . 
UNKNOWN So you'd have the battery as the kind of to keep it ticking over idea I'm really sorry we're gonna have to wrap up quite quickly , we don't have as much time as I thought . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN Um so I think that's what energy is referring to here . 
UNKNOWN Chip on print, is that that's an industrial design thing , is it David ? 
UNKNOWN Yes yes . 
UNKNOWN Okay um as for the case , kind of discussed that Yeah I know we're gonna have like rubber buttons that feel kind of Okay . 
UNKNOWN And this size here , I'd suggest this be small , like quite small . 
UNKNOWN Um just a a lot of the um I mean one of the things running through my mind right now , I realise we're being efficient to wrap up the meeting and have lots of decisions made , um but we are leaning quite a bit to the side of being low-tech , rubber buttons plastic frame , it's almost like we're reproducing the same old remote control that's out there . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Mm 'kay . 
UNKNOWN Should we think about how we are actually getting this high-tech user friendly uh um theme like what is it that we're u we're using to to achieve those goals ? 
UNKNOWN Like Okay so so backlighting , that would be good . 
UNKNOWN Could have things like backlighting the buttons and stuff like that . 
UNKNOWN Or even a clear case . 
UNKNOWN Um you know a a glowing a a glowing yellow type case where the yellow is showable , but in the dark it sort of , it's alive . 
UNKNOWN Yeah clear , that'd be Okay . 
UNKNOWN Aye that would be a good idea . 
UNKNOWN Yeah sure . 
UNKNOWN Um in in a slight subtle way . 
UNKNOWN S so like cur slightly transparent case , so it's yellow , like tinted yellow , but you can maybe see through it . 
UNKNOWN Yeah that'd be really good . 
UNKNOWN Yeah yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Is that what you mean ? 
UNKNOWN Or or there might be a light running through it like a mouse . 
CONFIRMATION Sure . 
UNKNOWN You know you have cordless mice and they don't eat that much power right . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah . 
UNKNOWN So the power the battery in that sense , maybe you have one or two stratig strategically placed lights that sort of Yeah but because the case is transparent so it gives it a little bit of a glow , doesn't make it freaky . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Sure . 
UNKNOWN Yeah they they emanate a light through it . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Lights . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um and then the other thing that we we're s we've committed ourselves to achieving is simplicity , and so I'm thinking maybe should we try and think about having something like um some kind of an innovative concept about how the um the volume and the channels are controlled , 'cause that's the main thing people will f wanna do . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Could we use like a jog dial , like a nice just sort of round , somewhere on it where you just roll it ? 
UNKNOWN The question is when you're rolling it , how do you wanna roll it ? 
UNKNOWN Or Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Do you want 'em to roll it like that ? 
UNKNOWN Do you want 'em to roll it like that ? 
UNKNOWN 'Cause in a mouse your hand's in a position to roll it , whereas the other thing about having it jog dial this way , it tends to get moved accidentally . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah if you are holding it in your hand you could you could do that , couldn't you ? 
UNKNOWN Well why don't we do it like a mouse then ? 
UNKNOWN If you're holding it in your hand you could Do you think ? 
UNKNOWN That's a very unnatural motion to yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Can you imagine you have to scroll a lot . 
UNKNOWN Um it might work for volume , and maybe some of the brightness controls and stuff like that , but not for channels right . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN If you have a Telewest box you've got like , you don't have to buy all the channels , you've about fifty channels , can you imagine trying to . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah okay okay um Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , sure . 
UNKNOWN Um and I don't think having that you know too quick too slow kin it's confusing to the I dunno . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Well , but then for um for skipping a large amount of channels you do have to uh to skip the channel button , the number part . 
UNKNOWN But users tend to tend to want to use that and once they lose out on the user experience they're like Because that's becomes the most accessible thing in front of Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Uh but Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN But that's not a bad thing is it ? 
UNKNOWN Just Okay um right well wouldn't it we do need to make a decision on whether we want to incorporate a jog dial in nice and quickly . 
UNKNOWN Because when you think about it , the alternative is to go push the button . 
UNKNOWN Jog dials are much easier than that . 
UNKNOWN You just roll . 
UNKNOWN Um I'm all for them actually , I think they're quite you know th very quick to m to use . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So does anybody oppose the idea of of incorporating one into the design at all ? 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN And the other thing was um can we think of any way of getting the slogan into this thing ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah like I mean if we if if we keep coming back to this board here , I wouldn't be surprised if we could take this idea , imagine that , I dunno , that it's within the shape of the hand , it's quite small I dunno . 
UNKNOWN Uh-huh . 
UNKNOWN Uh-huh ooh okay , we really gotta wrap up so yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It's small , and that we've got like the the l slogan somewhere like on the casing at the side , and that yeah well I mean isn't that what we just h said said we s just have to decide now ? 
UNKNOWN Okay well if we can do that , great . 
UNKNOWN Yeah okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah let's let's try and get the slogan on there um , and Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And then like a jo And then like a jog dial somewhere that fits in with the shape of it like I dunno like here , in with the It would get bumped , it's doesn't really fit with your hand . 
UNKNOWN So you wanna expand the shape of the That that might have one problem in terms of um in terms of whether you're left handed or you're right handed you might be locking yourself in . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Or maybe just fit it in like down the middle here . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Could I just could I just jump in and suggest something quickly ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Right I'm gonna have to I'm really gonna have to hurry you on here 'cause we're we're actually over time . 
UNKNOWN A jog di Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It's kind of yeah Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um is there anything anybody's unsure about ? 
UNKNOWN Just for in closing just the next meeting's gonna be in thirty minutes , and so you can see in the screen here what each of you are gonna hopefully be doing , uh I know that the designers are gonna be working with Play-doh on that . 
UNKNOWN So um that'll be that'll be good . 
UNKNOWN Huh . 
UNKNOWN Um and I'll get the the minutesup as soon as possible . 
UNKNOWN Anything at all you think we haven't discussed that we need to ? 
UNKNOWN Is everybody kind of happy about what they're gonna be doing ? 
UNKNOWN Um Yeah I think the jog dial , you know it just after you drew that , what if it was flat and you just spun it , that'd be great . 
UNKNOWN Um I think one thing would be the jog dial 'cause that's gonna have quite a big impact on the thing um Yeah that's what I was thinking the a slide, because then you you don't have to put the hand . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN I think incorporating a logo is quite straight forward . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN There's lots of space for it um Yeah but it's also a a marketing and a function Yeah . 
UNKNOWN That's kind of a design thing that you guys can can discuss , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Sure , yeah , yeah and materials we sorta said we'd do plastic and rubber , didn't we , and I think maybe we should try and stay away from just the big protruding rubber buttons , 'cause that'd just be so standard . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN To make something flush with the case ? 
UNKNOWN Something a bit more flush , yeah , or maybe have rubber incorporated into the case as well , so that it has and also t plastic I've seen can get really textured , so you can get plastics that actually feel soft in your hand . 
UNKNOWN Okay right . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Sp kinda grippy ? 
UNKNOWN Feel like fruit . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Fruits kids . 
UNKNOWN They feel kind of like um , you get pens now and then that you'd think that they were rubber but they're not , they're actually just plastic that's textured , kind of a little bit like Okay . 
UNKNOWN No like Yeah yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah yeah kinda like that yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay I'm gonna have to I'm gonna have to call this to a close 'cause we're way over time . 
UNKNOWN So um that's really good , like we've s had much to talk about that um pretty much run out of time to do so . 
UNKNOWN So off you go and design stuff wooh . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Play-doh time . 
UNKNOWN Yeah quite jealous actually . 
UNKNOWN You got to choose first . 
UNKNOWN No , we're kidding . 
UNKNOWN Okay , can I just swipe your power cable , I don't think it matters . 
UNKNOWN Okay lemme okay , I'm gonna pull everybody out first and then put in whoever needs to be left . 
UNKNOWN It's you . 
UNKNOWN Argh . 
UNKNOWN This is a real hassle and a oops . 
UNKNOWN I'm gonna take the microphones , 'cause it's too lazy t take them off again . 
CONFIRMATION Cool . 
UNKNOWN Okay we all all set ? 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Well this is the uh final detailed design meeting . 
UNKNOWN Um we're gonna discuss the look and feel design , the user interface design , and we're gonna evaluate the product . 
UNKNOWN And the end result of this meeting has to be a decision on the details of this remote control , like absolute final decision , um and then I'm gonna have to specify the final design in the final report. 
UNKNOWN So um just from from last time to recap , we said we were gonna have a snowman shaped remote control with no L_C_D_ display , no need for talk-back , it was hopefully gonna be kinetic power and battery uh with rubber buttons , maybe backlighting the buttons with some internal L_E_D_s to shine through the casing , um hopefully a jog-dial , and incorporating the slogan somewhere as well . 
UNKNOWN Anything I've missed ? 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN Okay um so uh if you want to present your prototype go ahead . 
UNKNOWN This is it ? 
UNKNOWN Ninja Homer , made in Japan . 
UNKNOWN Um , there are a few changes we've made . 
UNKNOWN Um , well look at the expense sheet, and uh it turned to be quite a lot expensive to have open up and have lots of buttons and stuff inside , so instead we've um this is gonna be an L_C_D_ screen , um just a a very very basic one , very small um with access to the menu through the the scroll wheel and uh confirm um button . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Mm 'kay . 
UNKNOWN Uh , apart from that , it's just pretty much the same as we discussed last time . 
UNKNOWN And there isn't uh d it doesn't open up to the advanced functions ? 
UNKNOWN So the advanced functions are still hidden from you , but they're hidden in the sense that um they're not in use . 
UNKNOWN Where are they ? 
UNKNOWN Um they're in the L_C_D_ panel and the jog-dial ? 
UNKNOWN Ah , right . 
UNKNOWN Okay 'cause The L_C_D_ panel just displays um functionally what you're doing . 
CONFIRMATION Great . 
UNKNOWN So w what kind of thing uh is gonna be Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN If you're using an advanced function right , like um c brightness , contrast , whatever , it will just say You know it's like it only has four columns , it's a very simple L_C_D_ like , whereas many the minimum amount we need that the user will automatically know like this is brightness or this is contrast . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Right , 'kay . 
UNKNOWN Okay cool . 
UNKNOWN It might even be one , a bit more complex L_C_D_ panel with pictures like maybe the sun or the , you know , the the symbols of the various functions . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm , and what is this here ? 
UNKNOWN Oh right okay . 
CONFIRMATION Cool . 
UNKNOWN That's a number pad . 
UNKNOWN Okay so the number pad is 'Kay , great . 
UNKNOWN Where are we gonna have the slogan ? 
UNKNOWN Um they're al along this Yeah . 
UNKNOWN You know , just like right inside there . 
UNKNOWN Okay cool . 
UNKNOWN You have this space here , and then you have this thing on the side as well , or at the bottom . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause slogans are usually quite small , right , they're not like huge so they're s Say a button's about say a button's about this size , right , so you would still have plenty of space for a slogan , say even for that . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Looks good . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So if this isn't to scale , what kind of dimensions are you thinking about here ? 
UNKNOWN Well we want the other buttons to be big enough to push easily with a finger so we reckon maybe that'll be about the same size as the palm of your hand . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Yep so that would be about a centimetre for a button , so one two three four centimetres . 
UNKNOWN Plus maybe half o five six seven eight , about yeah nine total . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN About nine in total . 
UNKNOWN Six , seven , eight , nine , ten . 
UNKNOWN So we're talking about ten centimetres . 
UNKNOWN That sounds good . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN That would be good . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN So ten centimetres in height . 
UNKNOWN Nine , ten . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN Okay um . 
UNKNOWN That'd be good , in fact a pen is about ten centimetres usually , so that would be that sounds like a really good size , if you see it there . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN That's great and it's very bright as well . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN So um okay . 
UNKNOWN Is it possible uh I'm just gonna bring up the idea of colours . 
UNKNOWN Is these are these the colours that of production , or is this just what we had available ? 
UNKNOWN Well I'm We're gonna have again the the sort of the foggy um yellow from last time that lit up when you pushed the button . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Um But um this button um , because it's red it's sort of very prominent , we're gonna use it as uh it can be the power button if you hold it for maybe two seconds it'll send a stand-by signal . 
UNKNOWN Okay so just could you just list all the things that it does s so I can write them in the report. 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um apart from that it's gonna be used as a confirm button for the L_C_D_ screen and you use this as a jog-dial . 
UNKNOWN Excuse me . 
CONFIRMATION Sure . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Okay so that's like an okay button , right . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Oh we've discussed how h high it is , but how wide is it ? 
UNKNOWN I don't know . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN How high is it ? 
UNKNOWN No as in the height , but what about the width ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Didn't put five centimetres . 
UNKNOWN Oh oh like depth of the actual thing . 
UNKNOWN Do we need five ? 
UNKNOWN I don't think five is be about th three and a half . 
CONFUSION Um . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Something by there . 
UNKNOWN Oh is this k to get an idea of scale from your from your thing there okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Sure . 
UNKNOWN So you can power on and off , what else can you do ? 
UNKNOWN Three and a half . 
UNKNOWN Um you can skip straight to a channel using these buttons . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um , were gonna have the volume control here , but um because we've got the the L_C_D_ and the jog-dial we just thought we'd um use that as the volume . 
UNKNOWN Okay jog-dial for volume . 
UNKNOWN And what else do you do with the jog-dial ? 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um you can use it for um more advanced functions like contrast , colour and Um yeah . 
UNKNOWN Contrast , brightness , yeah , and anything else ? 
UNKNOWN Um just whatever else we wanted to include as the advanced functions , um we didn't actually go through and specify the Uh what can a T_V_ do ? 
UNKNOWN Well of the designers what are they ? 
UNKNOWN Okay things like um brightness , contrast , um maybe tuning the channels . 
UNKNOWN Uh-huh . 
UNKNOWN Okay channel tuning . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN That's a good one . 
UNKNOWN What else ? 
UNKNOWN Um the various inputs . 
UNKNOWN Are you having a V_C_R_ , are you having you know which input do you have ? 
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm , mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Okay auxiliary inputs . 
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm , probably colour or sharpness . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Yep , colour , sharpness . 
UNKNOWN Sharpness . 
UNKNOWN Um a lot of these things will have to be um free and open for users to define them . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Okay what about uh sound settings ? 
UNKNOWN Uh d can you change any of those at all ? 
UNKNOWN Audio . 
UNKNOWN Audio , we have like your basic y your base , your mid-range , your high range . 
CONFUSION Um . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN the the balance hmm . 
UNKNOWN Yep , left-right balance , um maybe even pre-programmed sound modes , like um the user could determine like a series of sound modes , and then what could happen would be um when you click on that then it would go to that setting . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Okay , is there anything else at all it can do ? 
UNKNOWN Mm 'kay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN That 'cause that's that's fine . 
UNKNOWN Just need to know so I can write it down . 
UNKNOWN Okay um right I g I guess that's it , so we can now um We can now have a little look at the the Excel sheetand price listing , and see if we need to um if we need to rethink anything at all . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So um for this first part here power-wise , have we got battery ? 
UNKNOWN The battery . 
UNKNOWN Do we have kinetic as well ? 
NEGATION No . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN Okay , just battery . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN We need an Yep . 
UNKNOWN And that's because of cost restraints is it ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay um what about the electronics here ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah advanced chip . 
UNKNOWN We need an advanced chip I think , yep . 
UNKNOWN Advanced chip . 
UNKNOWN Let me just confirm that . 
UNKNOWN Yes I think so . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN Okay um the case , what does it mean by single and double , do you know ? 
UNKNOWN Um I think single would just be sort of one sort of oval whereas double is this sort of thing . 
UNKNOWN So we want double-curved ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Plastic . 
UNKNOWN Is there any rubber at all in the buttons or any Okay , um and we wanted special colours didn't we ? 
UNKNOWN I think we're gonna have to skip the rubber . 
CONFUSION Um . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN So I'll have to put that Oh no wait we ho how many colours have we got there ? 
UNKNOWN For the case itself , one colour . 
UNKNOWN It's one special colour . 
UNKNOWN Just one colour , okay . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause the case unit itself , the rest of our components go on top of it . 
UNKNOWN Okay so interface-wise , is it this third option we have , the two of them there ? 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN One and the L_C_ display . 
UNKNOWN Okay and then buttons , we have what , two colours ? 
UNKNOWN How many We've got push buttons as well . 
UNKNOWN Um we have um got some push buttons as well . 
UNKNOWN Or even clear . 
UNKNOWN Like uh oh wait so push button and integrated scroll wheel push okay . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN So I reckon we've got one button for this thing 'cause it's just one big sheetof rubber . 
UNKNOWN Uh-huh . 
UNKNOWN I'm not sure if that counts but You can see we're we're all very far beyond the Well we could take out ones by making it single curved , just fill in those bits . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Okay let's just be safe and put like say four buttons for that one . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Okay um and maybe a special colour for the buttons , so maybe four again . 
UNKNOWN Four . 
UNKNOWN So w why are we arriving at the number four ? 
UNKNOWN Where does the number four come from ? 
UNKNOWN 'Cause that's one button by its the complexity of twelve buttons . 
UNKNOWN Okay right , so we're writing down four . 
UNKNOWN So we're just estimating that yeah it would be less . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN How about these ? 
UNKNOWN Are we wanting them in no they're just is everything gonna be plastic ? 
NEGATION No . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So we're w w quite far over . 
UNKNOWN Now we're gonna something's gonna have to go . 
UNKNOWN Um we're at sixteen point eight and Well we h something has to go to the tune of two point t three Euro , so let me see , what are we I mean oh yes sorry , four point three . 
UNKNOWN Uh how mm-hmm how are we going to achieve this high-end product if We only have very sparse Two point three ? 
UNKNOWN Four point three no ? 
UNKNOWN My maths is all out . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And then where is the Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN How much would that save us ? 
UNKNOWN How much would that save us ? 
UNKNOWN That will only save you one . 
UNKNOWN That is one . 
UNKNOWN One . 
UNKNOWN The other thing could be that um you could take away the L_C_D_ panel and the advanced chip together , um because when you do something on the T_V_ , the T_V_ responds and reacts as well , so the user could be looking at the T_V_ and pushing his thing so we may not need to so when we scroll we need just some way to get the T_V_ to respond , which I think is a technically doable thing so Yep . 
UNKNOWN That's fair enough , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Okay so So w what's our reviewed suggestion ? 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um take away the L_C_ display ? 
UNKNOWN And the advanced chip goes away as well . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN To be replaced with a regular chip . 
UNKNOWN Regular chip . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So what that means is that um The twelve buttons that you see there . 
UNKNOWN And so we've got point three to get rid of . 
UNKNOWN Um and we ha where are the four the four push buttons are where exactly now ? 
UNKNOWN Twelve buttons . 
UNKNOWN That's um one piece of rubber but it's gonna have twelve button things underneath so Yeah w Um So I reckon Reckon that probably counts as a special form for the buttons . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Functionally you're gonna have to intercept So four is a good estimate for Yeah , so you can't actually cut It's like three times the number of buttons , four , eight , twelve . 
UNKNOWN Do you think ? 
UNKNOWN Like is is that one big button or is it twelve buttons , how can it be something in between ? 
UNKNOWN It It needs to be more than one big button because if you open up your phone , underneath there's actually one button underneath , it's just that the panel itself is a single panel . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Okay well we have point three to get rid of somewhere . 
UNKNOWN We just reportthat it has to be over budget , or the colours , you could take away s colours for th for the buttons . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN No can do . 
UNKNOWN Yeah we could just go with um Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Normal coloured buttons . 
UNKNOWN Well do you want colour differentiation here ? 
UNKNOWN No that's not the button we're talking about . 
UNKNOWN Oh yeah sorry yeah then . 
UNKNOWN That's the buttons only refer to the pad so Should we take that off uh ? 
UNKNOWN Right so Ah . 
UNKNOWN Hey it's back to the original . 
UNKNOWN That's it . 
UNKNOWN Um so then these just become normal coloured buttons , so that might be some some way of cutting the cost . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Okay , ach that's a shame . 
UNKNOWN Um right , so take away that completely ? 
UNKNOWN Ah . 
UNKNOWN And now we're under budget . 
UNKNOWN So we do have point five Euro to play with if we wanted . 
UNKNOWN Um Doesn't say so . 
UNKNOWN How about with embossing the logo , isn't that going to cost us some money ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN That's a freebie . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah that's a good idea . 
UNKNOWN Just one ? 
UNKNOWN Does that mean that one button has a special form or Yeah okay . 
UNKNOWN I think there's just one button so handy . 
UNKNOWN Well well there we go . 
UNKNOWN So I'm just gonna have to redraw this now . 
UNKNOWN So we're not gonna have the L_C_D_ anymore , and we'll just gonna have an on t on the T_V_ it'll show you what you're doing , which I think is fair enough , and so this is gonna be one big thing here . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Was the goal in your in your prototype design that it be as low profile as possible ? 
UNKNOWN What do you mean by profile ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Sort of flat as possible . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN You see I envision it as being um quite deep sort of deep enough to be comfy to hold in your hands rather than being wide and flat . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah that's what I was thinking , to Sure , okay . 
UNKNOWN We didn't have enough Play-Doh to make it three D_ . 
UNKNOWN Yeah alright yeah fair enough . 
UNKNOWN Okay , just thought I'd ask . 
UNKNOWN So there's one more dimension to the thing which we need to to add , and you might want to add in the report, length , width , and height . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Right okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So just to well to be thorough then , width-wise we're looking at about what three centimetres or something ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay and then so height-wise How how tall do you envisage it being ? 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN About that big ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah it works , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Two . 
UNKNOWN About two centimetres , okay . 
UNKNOWN Two's not very high at all though . 
UNKNOWN Maybe a bit higher ? 
UNKNOWN This is about this is about two . 
UNKNOWN Slightly more than two , so Okay . 
UNKNOWN See , about that thick . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Maybe closer to three even or two and a half . 
UNKNOWN Ach , that is Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay we'll s we'll say two point five . 
UNKNOWN Okay um so we have it within cost anyway . 
UNKNOWN Um so yeah project evaluation is this point . 
CONFUSION Um . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Right uh . 
UNKNOWN Okay so can we close that ? 
UNKNOWN This is what it's the final spec that it's gonna be . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Someone is gonna have to yeah that's fine that's fine . 
UNKNOWN Um it's probably just I dunno if it's worth getting into , but um just in in that we want this to be stylish , should we think a little bit more out of the box in terms of a button grid , because I've seen there's lots of devices out there that that instead of taking your standard nine nine square grid , and they have it sort of stylized or in different concept that that Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think that's something that's very hard to catch , so you you restrict the number of people who wanna try something . 
UNKNOWN Sure , okay . 
UNKNOWN The the look and the colour is something which is cool , but I think that there's also that factor of if it's too unfamiliar then um because when you put it on the shelf Yeah button shape might be a good idea to change , rather than rather than positioning , 'cause I think positioning is we're kinda engrained into the the telephone kind of pad . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , alright . 
UNKNOWN Okay , sure . 
UNKNOWN What about button shape ? 
UNKNOWN Square buttons ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Sure . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Right um . 
UNKNOWN So at this point we uh , let me see , discuss uh how satisfied we all are with um with these four points , with the room for creativity in the project , and leadership and teamwork , and the stuff we had around us I guess . 
UNKNOWN Mm 'kay . 
UNKNOWN Um , let me see uh Yeah I wasn't really sure what that was Yeah , yeah go for that first . 
UNKNOWN Do you want me to d um Do you want me to do my um design evaluation last ? 
UNKNOWN Maybe we should do the design evaluation first . 
UNKNOWN Or Evaluation . 
UNKNOWN I wasn't entirely sure what uh who was supposed to be doing that , but y you go for it . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Sure . 
UNKNOWN Um , alright so the way this works , I'm gonna need to plug into PowerPoint, I'll try and do it as quick as possible . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um , this is um I'll just go over your head if that's okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I don't think you need the power , so No , that's okay that's okay . 
UNKNOWN What's that ? 
UNKNOWN I don't need the PowerPoint? 
UNKNOWN No , the power cord itself . 
UNKNOWN Oh course , yeah that's true . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , so then you have a bit more freedom to You you still have your blue fingers . 
UNKNOWN Let me get that . 
UNKNOWN A bit more . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so what this is is a set-up for us to um uh use a kind of a like a The idea is that I've set up I've reviewed all of the um the points of discussion from the beginning , and used that as a criteria of evaluation for the um uh for the current design uh th or the plan , and uh so we can review that . 
UNKNOWN Is it ? 
UNKNOWN You killed a monster . 
UNKNOWN Uh I think it's gonna end up being sort of elementary because we're sort we're in n we're not gonna probably use it to change anything but Doesn't seem like it's going , does it ? 
UNKNOWN Oh there it is . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , okay great . 
UNKNOWN Uh and I'm gonna write up our results on the board , so this'll be a way for us to go through and decide if we're um sort of review where we stand with it . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so um So to sort of b bring together two things , sort of design goals and also the market research that we had , uh when we rate this , one is v high in in succeeding or fitting to our original aim and seven is low , okay . 
UNKNOWN Mm 'kay . 
UNKNOWN So these i these i th are the and um we've been asked to uh to collectively rate this , so what we can do is try and just y work on a consensus system so we just come to an agreement . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Okay ? 
UNKNOWN So the first one uh , stylish look and feel . 
UNKNOWN I rate that pretty highly . 
UNKNOWN Well yeah , I mean compared to most remote controls you see that's pretty good . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I dunno like a six or something . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah um me uh my only reservation with it was that we basically went with yellow because it's the company's colour , and I don't know if yellow's gonna really be a hit . 
UNKNOWN What does anybody else think ? 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN But What do you guys think ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN I'm seeing five then . 
UNKNOWN I would say five or six . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN David ? 
UNKNOWN Yep I'm fine with that . 
UNKNOWN Okay let's go with five then . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Fi oh uh just actually the opposite . 
UNKNOWN It's one to seven , right ? 
UNKNOWN The So it meant three , okay . 
UNKNOWN Oh yes sorry then , then I would say two or three . 
UNKNOWN Wait , what's the scale , one to seven , right ? 
UNKNOWN One's high-ish isn't it ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , one is high . 
UNKNOWN Ah , okay so yeah , two or three . 
UNKNOWN 'Kay Let's go with two point five then . 
UNKNOWN Okay , it's upside-down . 
UNKNOWN Okay , um control high tech innovation . 
UNKNOWN Well it has the wee jog-dial but Mm . 
UNKNOWN We had to remove Yeah , so we've had to remove a few of our features we wanted , but jog-dial 's good . 
UNKNOWN I'd go with three or four , maybe three . 
UNKNOWN Say it's more medium , but going towards a little bit higher than medium kind of thing . 
UNKNOWN Eight three . 
UNKNOWN Okay , three ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah about three , okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN Okay , um Style reflects a fruit inspired colour , design . 
UNKNOWN I shouldn't have said colour , but just Sorta . 
UNKNOWN Lemon . 
UNKNOWN Well that's kind of But the yellow , I mean it could be a lemon yellow colour , couldn't it ? 
UNKNOWN Okay , the blue the blue colours and don't re don't actually represent the colour , except for the b the the red button , they because for want of a Yeah , the the yellow is more representative of the colour , but the button itself , the blue can be anything else . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Yeah , could be . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay so we'll go two . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah ? 
UNKNOWN Okay , and um design is simple to use , simple in features . 
UNKNOWN Well yeah , I mean it's really basic looking isn't it ? 
UNKNOWN F f yeah f fairly basic , you guys think ? 
UNKNOWN I mean I'd give that nearly a one . 
UNKNOWN Yeah one . 
UNKNOWN Yep , that's fine . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , one ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um , soft and spongy , have we achieved that ? 
UNKNOWN We've used mostly plastic in the end so it's going to be quite a bit of a compromise for price . 
UNKNOWN Yeah I think it's about five . 
UNKNOWN Five ? 
UNKNOWN Five ? 
UNKNOWN That's really low . 
UNKNOWN Yeah well we have to use uh plastic so it's probably gonna be I think I'd probably increase the cost . 
UNKNOWN Well Yeah I suppose mm 'kay . 
UNKNOWN That's Um could we have used an entirely rubber frame to it ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , company logo . 
UNKNOWN Was that an option ? 
UNKNOWN I think it'll be cost prohibitive , yeah . 
UNKNOWN We've only got like what , ten cents left so Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It would cost more than plastic . 
UNKNOWN Okay , logo , we've got it in there , haven't we ? 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN Gonna have that on the side , aren't we , like there or something ? 
UNKNOWN Huh . 
UNKNOWN And um it's within budget , yep . 
UNKNOWN It is , isn't it ? 
UNKNOWN Okay , so we can say then that uh out of a possible or what would be our goal here ? 
UNKNOWN Out of forty nine , I guess . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , out of forty nine with with zero being the highest . 
UNKNOWN We are at uh two , seven , eight , ten , fifteen point five . 
UNKNOWN 'S pretty good . 
UNKNOWN So it's pretty good . 
UNKNOWN Translates to something like about approximately seventy two percent efficacy of our original goal . 
UNKNOWN Right ? 
UNKNOWN Uh yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think 'cause if you turn that into a hundred it would be about about thirty one , and then invert that , it's Oh right , about seventy , yeah seventy percent . 
UNKNOWN Twice that , about thirty one . 
UNKNOWN So yeah ab well yeah about sixty nine , seventy percent yeah . 
UNKNOWN It's pretty good . 
UNKNOWN Okay , good . 
UNKNOWN That was just a little formality for us to go through . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Yep , oh hundred pound pen . 
UNKNOWN Sorry alright . 
UNKNOWN Nobody saw it , honestly . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN The cameras did . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Is that you all have all finished , or Uh-huh . 
UNKNOWN Yeah that's that's me . 
UNKNOWN I did have one other um one other frame I thought , I mean I I d not knowing how we would deal with this information , I thought okay in theory this kind of a process would be about refining our design , revisiting our original goals . 
UNKNOWN It's not something I need to p push through , but I thought should we thinking more about the dimensions , um sort of like more of a three dimensional shapes as well as opposed to just that flat um Could our design involve a series of colours so that it's more of like a line where we have like sort of the , I don't know like the harvest line or the vibrant , I dunno the Whatever just some theme and then we have different tones , lime green , lemon . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN It's just discussion . 
UNKNOWN I mean obviously we can just abandon this , it's fine . 
UNKNOWN I'm just thinking about what we originally set out to do . 
UNKNOWN Um , yep so there . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN That's all . 
UNKNOWN Okay , great um are you submitting the the um evaluation criteria or am I ? 
UNKNOWN I don't know what your instructions have been . 
UNKNOWN Um , I think to record it and uh I haven't been asked to submit it yet . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay , uh just wondering if I need to include it in the minutes, because if you're submitting it anyway then Okay great . 
UNKNOWN I will , yeah . 
UNKNOWN It keeps getting too big . 
CONFIRMATION Cool . 
UNKNOWN Um right , uh well next up then , because we've done finance , is the project evaluation . 
UNKNOWN 'Kay I'm I'm listening I'm just trying to incorporate the logo into the the thing , so I'm playing with the Play-Doh as well . 
UNKNOWN Oh right , okay . 
UNKNOWN Just in case you're wondering , why is he still playing with the Play-Doh ? 
UNKNOWN Huh . 
UNKNOWN Just about right L_E_G_O_ Lego . 
UNKNOWN My leg . 
UNKNOWN Right , okay . 
UNKNOWN Um well do you wanna um just individually say what you think about about these four points and or not those four points , my four points , sorry , forgotten that . 
UNKNOWN You got a different uh Oh yeah , they're good aren't they , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN I like those printer cables that just have the two little butterfly clips like that . 
UNKNOWN It's really quick . 
UNKNOWN Right okay , um yeah here we are . 
UNKNOWN To use . 
UNKNOWN Uh as a note we'll do this alphabetically . 
UNKNOWN Um do you wanna start Andrew ? 
UNKNOWN Sure , um so what is it you're asking of me now ? 
UNKNOWN I don't know , just um your opinion on those four those four points really and how we used them . 
UNKNOWN Or sort of our work on setting this up . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well , is it uh okay I'll just go through your system then . 
UNKNOWN The the room uh is fairly institutional , but um the main thing is , I think um our use of this space is more just to reporton things as opposed to be creative and constructive and it would probably help to um have l sort of a cumulative effect of we have ideas and we come back and then the ideas are still in discussion , you know , as in other words this this room is sort of a centre point of creativity , whereas in reality as we've gone through this , it's not really the centre point of creativity , it's more just a d debating Yeah , yeah but that's just the thing is the quest in terms of the the first point there , the room , it feels as though the creativity goes on when we leave , and then we come here and then we kind of put out our ideas and then , you know . 
UNKNOWN Uh-huh . 
UNKNOWN Well d do you feel though that that you were able to have quite a lot of creative input into the thing ? 
UNKNOWN But I don't I don't think it means the room as in this room . 
UNKNOWN I think it means like you know Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Oh , oh right right , oh right okay room for creativ Oh right I just looked up and saw okay whiteboard , digital pens , the room . 
UNKNOWN Room . 
UNKNOWN Oh yeah . 
UNKNOWN No , of course , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well I dunno do you th I think it means um I think it means did you feel you were able to give creative input so Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Sorry . 
UNKNOWN Huh . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah I th okay on th um yeah dif answering the question uh in those terms I'd say that actually there's sort of a tease of creativity because we're asked to work through this , but actually the guidelines are fairly contrived in terms of um okay fashion trends , say fruit and vegetable colour scheme , but then i then we're told okay use the co company company colours . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN So what do we do . 
UNKNOWN We're told okay um think in terms of style and look and feel and technology , but build something for twelve and a half pounds , so actually the creativity was more more of like a um a f sort of a f formality then an actual Yeah within the constraints the Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN You feel like you're caged within whatever y It's like a balloon in a cage , it can only go so big and not hit the side . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN The constraints do come in very fast . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay uh do you know what , actually let's take each point and everybody discuss it , I think . 
UNKNOWN So Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So still on the topic of room for creativity uh next up is Craig . 
UNKNOWN Um I agree with his point it's um it is quite a lot of fun t to go and then you have sort of hit the end then go right , gotta cut everything out 'cause we don't have enough money . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN I think another point is that the meetings um are more brainstorming sessions than meetings , so time is also a very s um strong factor , and structure . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Because for a brainstorming meeting you want a structure that allows you to allows ideas to get tossed , um to be evaluated , and to be reviewed , and to get feedback and come back . 
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm , mm-hmm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah . 
UNKNOWN And I guess that point about the room not being r very friendly to that , I think that's a very big thing , and I think the fact that we're wearing these things restricts I feel it 'cause I wear m my glasses , right , and that but that irritates me right it it it does actually you know affect how , w whether you feel comfortable to communicate . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , sure . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN New creativity . 
UNKNOWN I feel like I'm hiding behind the equipment , rather than the equipment is helping me , and you know . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN So you think a more relaxed atmosphere would be more kind of conducive to creative thought or Yeah , but actual environment ? 
UNKNOWN Not not so much an atmosphere , the atmosphere is very relaxed , but the the gear yeah you know that creates boundaries to that um and and the time the time given also restricts Excuse me . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Very good . 
UNKNOWN Um what about leadership ? 
UNKNOWN I don't know if that means like , if I did a good job or something . 
UNKNOWN I don't really know . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , well well I mean my sense on that is sort of what kind of guidance and direction , encouragement Yeah from and you as well I think , just sort of acting as team leader . 
UNKNOWN From like your personal coach person and stuff like that , do you think maybe ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um yeah I think I think it's I think it's good . 
UNKNOWN I mean my personal views on on leadership is that effective effective leadership sort of um gives people a certain room for freedom and delegation , but then to come back with something that they take great ownership and you know , innovative thought with . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN In in reality I think here the the different elements of leadership such as the the original b briefing and then the personal coach and the and then you know having having you with your the meeting agendais actually quite a quite a quite a con confining framework to work within . 
UNKNOWN And so it is leadership almost to the point of sort of disempowering the the the team member , so But it's not bad leadership , it's just sort of s fairly strong , you know . 
UNKNOWN Uh-huh , okay . 
UNKNOWN It turns it turns the individual into more of like a um sort of a predetermined mechanism , as opposed to a sort of a free Yeah , oh yeah , without without a doubt . 
UNKNOWN So you think maybe a little too controlling or Okay . 
UNKNOWN I think controlling is not the right word , I think the interactions are very structured . 
UNKNOWN Yeah maybe not co confining . 
UNKNOWN I think structure is probably what you're saying that , each individual is structured to one particular task , and one parti rather than controlling . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm , mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN I don't think there's a sense of control 'cause all the decisions have been made in terms of a , like a consensus right , we go around and we think about it , but that you know process actually says you have to do it in a certain way . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm , mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Uh-huh . 
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm , mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN It doesn't tell you , you know , some ways that you might wanna be a bit more creative in terms of the process you know , not the I think you tried to use the common share folder to to to to communicate , but um it just comes back to us so slow in the emailum it it doesn't have a , you know , a messenger will go . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm , mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay , uh what about teamwork ? 
UNKNOWN Um did , you wanna comment Craig ? 
UNKNOWN Uh , reckon that was a bit hard because we could only discuss things in the meeting . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN If we could just go up to somebody outside the meeting and have a quick talk with them , that would've been a lot easier . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Fully agree . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Did uh did you guys get the emailI sent you ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Not just yet . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Oh that's alright . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , got the email. 
UNKNOWN I was wondering if that got there okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Okay , um so um to s to to summarize the teamwork issue , saying that if we could communicate outside the meeting , you know just like quick questions , quick thoughts , whatever , it probably would be bit easier . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , in it Mm-hmm , mm-hmm , mm-hmm , exactly . 
UNKNOWN I think the tools that they were given , the tool set that were given to us are fancy but they don't support collaboration , I think that's the word . 
UNKNOWN They don't support the team working together , you know , they're still very individual tools . 
UNKNOWN Oh right , okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I mean if you Yeah , I mean sort of taking upon that idea , w the way I see this i is that it's uh the the s the structure in which we've we've approached this whole task is quite contrary to the p principle of teamwork because the the tasks were d d sort of um divided , and then the work went on in isolation I I don't know what you guys did while you were together , maybe that was a bit different , but um yeah , but um but actually if you if you imagine not entire the completely same task given to us but us said okay , first thing we have to do is come up with um let's say um a design concept , and we sit here together and do it , well that's what teamwork is . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN We had Play-Doh fun . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN To s to say okay go off and don't talk to each other , it's actually p sort of predisposes you to quite the contrary of teamwork . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um not that we haven't done I think the best we could have done . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN I'm not dissatisfied with it . 
UNKNOWN Right , uh anything else to say on teamwork at all ? 
UNKNOWN No , not really . 
UNKNOWN Okay , um what about the you know how we used the whiteboard , the digital pens , the projector, stuff like that ? 
UNKNOWN Um did anybody think anything was like really useful , anything was pretty un f unsupportive ? 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN I think the whiteboard , for me , is the kind of thing I would use all the time , but it's um not quite as useful as to us as it could have been , maybe just in the way that we we use it , in the sense that once we have an idea out there or while work was going on in between meetings , that could have been up on a board uh you know as opposed to in like in text . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Um , and then we could then keep our ideas sort of building on that . 
UNKNOWN I know that people who design cars and you know in aviation they quite often just have a simple like fibreglass prototype and it's completely you know um abs abstract from the final product , but they use it as a kind of a context to sort of walk around and puzzle and and point and discuss and and and in a way everybody's as we discuss things in the in theoretically and out of our notebooks, we're just we're actually just each of us discussing something that's in each of our own minds . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And point at ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It wasn't until we had this here , you know , like at one point I peeked across and looked at Craig's paperand I'm like , now I know what he's thinking 'cause I saw his book. 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Ah . 
UNKNOWN But the b the b whiteboard could've actually been this kind of continuing um Think could be , yeah . 
UNKNOWN So do you think producing a prototype earlier in the process woulda been a good idea ? 
UNKNOWN I think um the the focus of it a lot was the PowerPointas opposed to the to the whiteboard , and I think that m um is also does you know hinder us and things I think . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN It will be cooler to have the whiteboard rather than the the PowerPoint, or maybe the whiteboard and the PowerPointin the same place , you know in the centre of the I think that there were too many PowerPoints in the meetings . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , because the PowerPointwas provided to us while we had time to prepare , whereas I can imagine if I'd been encouraged to use Paintbrush , for example , or whatever , I would've actually used it , um 'ca you know , just 'cause that's sorta how we what we were set up to to use while we had our time . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
UNKNOWN Okay uh Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause the plug-in and the plugging spent we spent a lot of time doing that . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And a lot of the information on the PowerPoints , I don't think , you know , we needed to actually it could have , we could have gone through it verbally , especially my slides, I felt that they just you know as opposed to having to present them . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN No , not quite . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN What about the digital pens , did you find them easy enough to use ? 
UNKNOWN Oh they're a bit clunky . 
UNKNOWN Sure , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yep clunky . 
UNKNOWN Agreed . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN Clunky , okay . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Um Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Having to tick it before you go off was a bit hindering as well , 'cause you're half way through a thought , and then you run out of paperand then you have to jump . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN I know , I think at the very start of today I like wrote a whole load of stuff , 
UNKNOWN didn't click note on one , then went back and wrote one tiny wee thing on the another page, 
UNKNOWN but then did click note , and so I'm quite worried that I've just written over the top of it or something , 
UNKNOWN but they'll have my paperanyway um and haven't done that since . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm , mm-hmm . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN But I think the pen is v is very intuitive , everybody knows how to use it , we don't have to worry . 
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm , mm-hmm , mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah . 
UNKNOWN So I think the pen's good . 
UNKNOWN It's about the best thing . 
UNKNOWN And o on the topic of the technology , it just occurred to me that we actually didn't need to move our computers because each computer has all of the files . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It just occurred to me that they all We only actually needed one computer . 
UNKNOWN Yeah we only needed one computer and And the computer may not um be conducive to a meeting because um you tend to look at your computer and wanna have the urge to check something , you know , it's useful but I think too many computers are just distracting . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's true . 
UNKNOWN If there had been a fifth , that coulda just been sitting there ready to go the whole time . 
UNKNOWN Good point . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Do you think the computers just provide distraction in a meeting ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um Yep . 
UNKNOWN I know I I like to have things written down in front of me actually , like a lot of the stuff that was emailed to me I ended up you know like writing down there or something so I could look at it really quickly and not have the distraction of all of that , um I don't know about anybody else . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um what else uh any wh I do I'm not really sure what they're looking for when they say new ideas found . 
UNKNOWN Um I don't know is could you think of like anything else that would have been helpful today at all ? 
UNKNOWN Is this for the project or Oh yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well , the w main one for me is that uh the process na in a natural f context would not have been interrupted by this necessity to discommunicate ourselves from each other . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN So , that's kind of a new idea for me is like just sort of that idea , well you know it's kind of s hard to keep f working forward on a team a team based project when when you're told you must now work away from your team . 
UNKNOWN Yeah if we just had uh Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah I I dunno I think it was quite good that we had time limits on the meetings because they really could have run on and like my experience with meetings is that they really do , and you can spend a lot of time talking about The only thing is though like when we had our meeting about the conceptual design , I thought there maybe another fifteen minutes would have been useful there but um yeah . 
UNKNOWN Oh yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm , mm-hmm , mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN I really thi i I think maybe if we'd like all been working in the one room , and they just said you know like every hour or something everybody make sure yo you know just have a have a short meeting and then just c just to have like something written down , just like you know a a milestone if you like um rather than having meetings , but There you go . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um so in closing , I haven't got my five minutes to go . 
UNKNOWN Thin Oh there it i Five minutes to go . 
UNKNOWN Wonderful . 
UNKNOWN Okay um are the costs within the budget , yes they are . 
UNKNOWN And is the project evaluated , yes it is . 
UNKNOWN So now celebrate . 
CONFIRMATION Great . 
UNKNOWN So it So now we I I don't know . 
UNKNOWN And we have Ninja Homer . 
UNKNOWN Well apparently now I write the final report. 
UNKNOWN Do we know what the other ones are ? 
UNKNOWN What are you guys doing now ? 
UNKNOWN You dunno ? 
UNKNOWN Oh wow . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN That is lovely . 
UNKNOWN Hey yeah , I said Ninja Homer . 
UNKNOWN What did you call it ? 
UNKNOWN Ninja Homer . 
UNKNOWN See it looks like Homer Simpson but it's electronic so it's made in Japan . 
UNKNOWN Huh , huh . 
UNKNOWN So is that j is that just is that just a logo or does it do anything ? 
UNKNOWN Logo . 
UNKNOWN Yeah it's just a logo . 
UNKNOWN Just a logo and then like Ninja Homer , right okay . 
UNKNOWN Huh . 
UNKNOWN Ninja Homer . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN The the red is supposed to represent the whatever else you wanna printon the side of it . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN I think it's quite nice . 
UNKNOWN Fashion technology or something . 
UNKNOWN You can wear Homer , you can throw Homer when you're frustrated , doh . 
UNKNOWN Hmm , hmm , hmm . 
UNKNOWN Oh no , that's cool , it's got I'm kind of I'm slightly gutted that we couldn't get plastic and rubber , I think that would have been nice . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN It's clunky . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Ah well , maybe from now on real reaction should give us more money . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Oh , I did learn something new , Play-Doh is useful . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Play-Doh s Really ? 
UNKNOWN No it is it is . 
UNKNOWN It is useful and in in in in in in in um conceptualizing , in being creative . 
UNKNOWN Huh . 
UNKNOWN Huh . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause like you say , it's something you can put your hands on and feel and touch and get a sense for . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Like we were playing with the Play-Doh and the ideas came with the Play-Doh rather than with everything else . 
UNKNOWN Did they ? 
UNKNOWN You might wanna write that down . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It's just , I'm just fiddling with the Play-Doh , and I'm going yeah yeah it's kinda cool . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Play-Doh . 
UNKNOWN No , it's true , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Guess I'd forgot how good s Play-Doh smells . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , it smells funny doesn't it . 
UNKNOWN And some Play-Dohs are actually I think edible aren't they ? 
UNKNOWN Um Yeah like the stuff for I think it has to be , yeah . 
UNKNOWN No , all Play-Doh is edible . 
UNKNOWN I think they're all non-toxic 'cause it's aimed for like two-year-olds . 
UNKNOWN It's just wheat , it's the stuff that your mom could make with preservatives and uh It's helpful to the creative process . 
UNKNOWN Wow , hmm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah um so to wha what are your summarising words about Play-Doh ? 
UNKNOWN Huh . 
UNKNOWN Um it engages all your senses not just your sight , but your sense of feel your sense of touch . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN And it helps you to understand dimension as well . 
UNKNOWN Taste . 
UNKNOWN I think that that's very helpful because it it starts to pop up , whereas on a piece of paper, on a computer , on a board , um even with a three D_ graphic thing it still , it requires a lot of yeah tangible , that's a nice word . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm , yep . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah it's not very tangible . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm , mm-hmm , mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN It becomes tangible . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Tangible . 
UNKNOWN Okay uh Mm . 
UNKNOWN I don't know if there's anything else we needed to discuss . 
UNKNOWN Nope . 
UNKNOWN That that's about it really . 
UNKNOWN Just sit still I guess for a little while . 
UNKNOWN Do we retreat to our , to continue our r reporting or what i Uh-oh . 
UNKNOWN I think we could probably do it here as long as we don't collaborate . 
UNKNOWN Um Well I dunno . 
UNKNOWN Um I'm sure the little uh the little thing'll pop up any minutenow . 
UNKNOWN Can we turn off the microphones ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah if the meeting's over then yeah I guess so . 
UNKNOWN Okay , well I think we're ready to begin . 
UNKNOWN Right , my name's Adam Duguid , we're here because of real reaction , um , we have in the group Um , yeah , go for it mate . 
UNKNOWN Oh , Ebenezer Ademesoye . 
UNKNOWN Would you like me to spell that ? 
UNKNOWN S Um , N_E_Z_ E_R_ . 
UNKNOWN N_ E_ Z_ . 
UNKNOWN Ebenezer . 
UNKNOWN And your role is ? 
UNKNOWN I'm the Marketing Expert . 
UNKNOWN You're the Marketing Expert , okay . 
UNKNOWN Next we have ? 
UNKNOWN Tarik Rahman . 
UNKNOWN T_A_R_I_K_ . 
UNKNOWN T_ R_ I_ K_ . 
UNKNOWN And your role in this is ? 
UNKNOWN Industrial Designer . 
UNKNOWN Industrial Designer . 
UNKNOWN And , lastly we have ? 
UNKNOWN Uh , Dave Cochrane . 
UNKNOWN And you're going to be the User Interface , is it ? 
UNKNOWN User Interface Defin Designer , yes . 
UNKNOWN Designer . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN This is the agendafor today's meeting . 
UNKNOWN As you can see , w opening , acquaintance , tool training , project plan discussion , and closing . 
UNKNOWN Um , we already got n through opening , and partially through acquaintance . 
UNKNOWN So , the reason we're here , we're gonna design a new remote control , as you probably all know . 
UNKNOWN The very broad overview is original , trendy , and user-friendly . 
UNKNOWN Course , we'll have to go into a bit more um detail than that , but uh personally I think that the original is gonna be a very key aspect to this design . 
UNKNOWN Um , there's a lot of remote controls out there anyway , so we're gonna need something that's really gonna set it apart . 
UNKNOWN This is how today seems to be going to work . 
UNKNOWN We're gonna have the three kay phases , as you've probably already been told , the functional , architectural , and the detailed design . 
UNKNOWN Um First one's gonna be covering the user requirement spec , technical functions , working design . 
UNKNOWN Second seems to be conceptual components , properties , materials , and the last one is a detailed analysis of our design so far . 
UNKNOWN Of course , you've all got the similar emails , I believe , right . 
UNKNOWN What can I say ? 
UNKNOWN Ebenezer , you wanna have a you wanna drawyour favourite animal ? 
CONFIRMATION Sure . 
UNKNOWN Whiteboard . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN S okay . 
UNKNOWN I will make this quick , since we don't have much time . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN 'Kay , so it's not the best picture in the world . 
UNKNOWN Here we have an elephant . 
UNKNOWN First point , begins with an E_ , same like Ebenezer . 
UNKNOWN Also , elephants have a very good memory , much like myself , and I can't remember back when I used to live back in Nigeria , but I think I used to have a pet elephant . 
UNKNOWN So elephants are big , strong and gentle , and they have great memories , and they begin with the letter E_ , just like Ebenezer . 
UNKNOWN Brilliantly done . 
THANKS Thank you . 
THANKS Thank you . 
UNKNOWN Tarik , would you like to have a shot at a bit of artistry ? 
UNKNOWN . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN Oh , um , you can clip them to your belt . 
UNKNOWN Oh oh I think you ga The little The the Oh that's good , we can clip them on . 
UNKNOWN Do we take them off ? 
UNKNOWN Oh right , okay . 
UNKNOWN You should also l um have your the lapel mic on as well . 
UNKNOWN Ah-ha . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , there was this microphone as well that you Just um somewhere I think so . 
UNKNOWN Now where do I put the Is this supposed to be clipped as well ? 
UNKNOWN Yep , the , it's just across there , that's it . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It'll follow you if you You can probably just stick it in your pocket for now , I wouldn't worry too much . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN There you go . 
UNKNOWN Should have good range . 
UNKNOWN Uh , destroying your elephant here . 
UNKNOWN Uh , here we have a tiger . 
UNKNOWN Uh I've always loved tigers . 
UNKNOWN They're just they're big , they're biggest cats , uh I did a project on cats in the wild when I was a kid and uh it was my favourite cat , just 'cause it was looks the best , the stripes , orange . 
UNKNOWN My dad used to talk about he's from Bangladesh so he used to tell me all about them when he was when I was a kid . 
UNKNOWN And uh they're just the most feared of of uh animals in the wild . 
UNKNOWN So uh that's why I like them . 
UNKNOWN Didn't say an anything about me really but Mm . 
UNKNOWN Excellent , thank you very much . 
UNKNOWN Dave , if you'd like to uh have a dash . 
UNKNOWN Um Um , the monkey , um . 
UNKNOWN The one f uh in fact this is a somewhat oblique reference in fact to uh well my I have a three uh three y year old daughter who h who who who is affectionately known as Miss Monkey . 
UNKNOWN Um , monkeys have attitude . 
UNKNOWN Which I think is a good thing . 
UNKNOWN And I mean fr and from uh from the point of view of sort of the study of human evolution they and other primates are terribly interesting . 
UNKNOWN Um , so I like monkeys . 
UNKNOWN And and th th th th thi thi this one seems to have perhaps more attitude than most . 
UNKNOWN Cheers . 
UNKNOWN Hardly what I'd call the best drawingin the world but it'll do for now . 
UNKNOWN Also not quite as feared as your average tiger , but uh cats are one of my favourite animals , they're very independent , they're snotty as hell at the best of times , and uh , what can you say , you got to love those qualities in an animal . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN I think we've all managed to master the whiteboard there by looks of it , so , on to it . 
UNKNOWN Project finance . 
UNKNOWN As you can see , twelve point five Euros per unit . 
UNKNOWN That's not a terrible lot as far as I'm aware , and we're hoping to sell them for twenty five . 
UNKNOWN If we're aiming for fifty million Euros we're gonna have to be selling an awful lot of them . 
UNKNOWN Oh , that was profiting , that was an amount , so that's the amount made , okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN Well , fifty million , and if you're making twelve point five Euros on each one , then , awful lot need to be sold . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Now we better actually just get on with the uh the meat of the project . 
UNKNOWN So I'm gonna guess that we've all used remote controls . 
UNKNOWN Any ideas of where you think a new remote control could go into this market ? 
UNKNOWN Well , one thing I'm aware of is , th there uh um at the sort of v very high price end of the market there's there's a em emerging market for sort of touch screen L_C_D_ remotes that can be uh programmed in m much more sophisticated ways than sort of conventional models , so you get the sort of you get um you you can redesign the interface to your own needs , you can programme in macros , and you get a much greater degree um um I mean you get in these sort of three in one , five in one , whatevers , but you can get integration between the different uh the the the diff the different things that it's designed to control , to a much greater extent , and you can have one uh you know one macro to turn the uh you know turn the T_V_ to the right channel , get the uh re uh rewind the tape in the V_C_R_ and get it to play once it's rewound , for instance . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um b it occurs to me there might be a niche for uh for a remote that aimed towards some of that sort of functionality but using a just conventional push button design . 
UNKNOWN And therefore putting it into a um well much lower price bracket . 
UNKNOWN Okay , yeah , tha that's true , with the price range we're looking at , going for a touch screen would probably be possibly out of our yeah . 
UNKNOWN Absolutely prohibitive , yeah . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN But you think uh again something to control multiple units in uh a simple fashion . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I mean I wouldn't like to say you g I mean you get ones that you can switch between multiple units , but something that could um operate between multiple units in a more integrated fashion . 
UNKNOWN Some and ideally something into which it would have some at least limited facility for um running macros . 
UNKNOWN Would the the idea something along the lines of , one on button would turn on say the video recorder , the T_V_ , maybe the sound system as well , all in one go , is that kind of Okay , that sounds like a a good strong idea . 
UNKNOWN For instance , um let's say oh oh um , or um you know you pr uh you press uh say the play button for the D_V_D_ player and it turns the T_V_ on and onto the right channel as well , um Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN 'Kay Well um I've noticed that uh gaming c is becoming quite popular with television , um when I was younger we used to e play games using our cable , using the cable subscribed the cable providers , but our remote controls would get worn out really easily , and the remote control was not a great kind of keyboar , um keypad , for playing games . 
UNKNOWN Um Any takes on this ? 
UNKNOWN So perhaps one that was more um specialised for game playing or interactive television . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN They they've recently brought out this new remote control , for people to set their favourite channels , or um to record things . 
UNKNOWN Instead of people entering in what time things start , you simply stri slidea bar to say what time it begins , and slideanother bar to say what time it ends , you know that's Yeah , it's it's taken out the Y you don't have to be uh really clever to use a remote control . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah I've heard I've seen the bar-code design before , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN I think for gaming , you know you want you want some big buttons for up , down , left and right , shoot . 
UNKNOWN Uh , you wanna be able to change angles in interactive television , so you need buttons to change the television angle , the camera angles and stuff like that . 
UNKNOWN Okay , well we're beginning to run out of time now , so , we've got a couple of ideas , we can we'll have to work fast , um , alright as you can see we've got thirty minutes until the next meeting , so we'll have to try and decide on some of the basic functionality , um , how the user interface might work , that'll be a key aspect especially if the idea of um some kind of macros facility because you have to program it , you have to have a lot of response back , or at least some kind . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um And we're gonna maybe n try and have to figure out what the user wants , yes . 
UNKNOWN What the user wants uh . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um , right . 
UNKNOWN Has anybody got anything they'd like to add at this stage , anything they think that might have been missed so far ? 
UNKNOWN Well when you're talking about gaming and stuff , do you think they should have some sort of stick on it , rather than buttons ? 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN Okay , . 
UNKNOWN Like uh control pads , you know of games , but or is that a bit ridiculous ? 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN I I don't see why not , almost everybody is probably used to a console by now , and all of them incorporate small keypads on them , in fact even the mobile phones these days are beginning to use them as well , so it's probably an interface that most people are used to . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um and that could allow n easy navigation , used as a joystick as well . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN The other key feature that uh that would be a good idea built into it is t is is to make something you know fairly sort of ergonomic , something that just fits fits as comfortably as possible into the hand . 
UNKNOWN But of course , uh al al also allows for the possibility of a more sort of slightly unconventional or attractive uh sha shape for it overall , . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So , small , stylish , and something that's just a little different . 
UNKNOWN A curve , mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Something sort of sort of sl slightly sort of biomorphic in form , uh which it would need to be to sort of conform to the shape of the hand more efficiently anyway . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN That's definitely something that we should be able to do quite easily . 
UNKNOWN I would I would have hoped so anyway . 
UNKNOWN Um , right . 
UNKNOWN I'd say we finish this one up , we get started , I'll get in , I'll write up what we've um kind of quickly done , and I'll get that out to everybody . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah ? 
UNKNOWN So . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN . 
UNKNOWN . 
UNKNOWN Um , as far as I'm aware we leave the microphones here , um unless we get told otherwise , and just take the laptops with us . 
UNKNOWN Just put it on the deskt desktop . 
UNKNOWN No on the desktop you'll find you should find that there's a project documentslink . 
UNKNOWN A well actually just there . 
UNKNOWN Project documents, yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN That's it . 
UNKNOWN If you dump it in there . 
UNKNOWN What's your username ? 
UNKNOWN Your username . 
UNKNOWN What's your username and password ? 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Sorry . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN There we go . 
CONFIRMATION Excellent . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Hopefully that's us ready to uh to go . 
UNKNOWN So . 
UNKNOWN Functional design meeting . 
UNKNOWN We'll have to flesh out some of the uh stuff . 
UNKNOWN Um we'll start with the minutesof the last meeting . 
UNKNOWN Not a lot thankfully to say . 
UNKNOWN We introduced ourselves , discussed the possibility of a macro facility , interac interacting the T_V_ a bit more , um mentioning of bar-code , joystick for user manipulation , um and ergonomics of the remote control as well . 
UNKNOWN Um it's come to my attention the following . 
UNKNOWN Teletext has become outdated due to the populat popularity of the internet . 
UNKNOWN Remote control should only be used for the T_V_ . 
UNKNOWN Um due for uh time to market and possibly also cost issues . 
UNKNOWN Um also key is the corporate image should stay recognisable , um f uh your colour and slogan of course is down at the bottom there . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Now . 
UNKNOWN Just to say quickly uh I would have thought that only being used for a television the macro facility may now not be required . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Um or at l its functionality would have been of limited use . 
UNKNOWN So to the point in my opinion anyway that it might not be worth pursuing . 
UNKNOWN Um if anybody disagrees we can uh definitely say so . 
UNKNOWN Um and hopefully we'll just crack on and we'll get everything going . 
UNKNOWN Um I'd like to if possible hear from our Marketing Expert first , to help us gain an idea of where we're going to go . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN So um I'll just load up your presentationfrom here if you want . 
CONFIRMATION Sure . 
UNKNOWN Um , sh would you like to I'll just do it from here . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN Sorry . 
CONFUSION Uh . 
UNKNOWN Is yours the Oh sorry . 
UNKNOWN Um , try second one maybe . 
UNKNOWN Try it , yeah maybe . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Okay , right . 
UNKNOWN Oh , I thought I put in my last name , I guess not , but . 
UNKNOWN Uh if you that's all right . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN If you do you want me to just cycle through it for you or ? 
UNKNOWN Oh yeah , that'd be fine , that'd be great . 
UNKNOWN Yeah ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Functional requirement by me Ebenezer . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so um we did some research , we asked one hundred people their opinions on remote controls . 
UNKNOWN We asked some uh open ended questions , just , what are your opinions on the remote control , got a lot of re responses , and we asked some very specific questions , and we got a lot of good feedback . 
UNKNOWN Please bear in mind this is only a hundred people , so even when the groups are divided into fifteen to twenty five , twenty five to thirty five , there's only maybe ten people fifteen people in each group . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So we got some the bad stuff we got , remotes are often lost . 
UNKNOWN I often lose my remote control , the back of the couch , some place , and even if it's not lost permanently , it takes me a few minutes to find it . 
UNKNOWN Most buttons are not used any more , like you said , teletext is outdated now . 
UNKNOWN I remember trying to load a D_V_D_ player recently , and there were so many buttons , it took me I don't know maybe ten minutes to to go through each button , 'cause you have to press the shift button to access the yellow buttons , you know there's just a lot of stuff that no one really uses . 
UNKNOWN And if they do , not very often . 
UNKNOWN Takes too long to master the remote control . 
UNKNOWN I've seen some remote controls that are big , they have a lot of buttons , you have to hold down more than one key at one time to do something , they're just not great to use . 
UNKNOWN We just got a lot of bad complaints about remote controls , people do not like remote controls . 
UNKNOWN Some of the good stuff we got . 
UNKNOWN Between the age of uh fifteen and twenty five , most people would be willing to pay extra for voice recognition software . 
UNKNOWN Now don't get excited yet , I've got more to say on that . 
UNKNOWN Most people'd be willing to pay for that um most people want remote controls to be pretty , they want it to be fancy , th they they want it to be different , everybody has a white remote control with black buttons , and a red button and a green button , not everybody wants that . 
UNKNOWN Finally , my opinion . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN The voice recognition thing is cool . 
UNKNOWN And uh voice recognition , the software , open source software exist already . 
UNKNOWN It's a bit sketchy at some times , uh , you're not gonna get good always accurate results , but for a very fixed number of words , you know you have , how many different words can you have for a remote control , up , down , left , right , channel five , channel seven , you know , how many , you can't have that many words . 
UNKNOWN For a fixed vocabulary it works quite well . 
UNKNOWN I'm pretty sure people would buy it . 
UNKNOWN But after a while people may wanna return it , because if you have to to say som I mean most people use a remote control for switching to channels , and they say they do that about ninety eight percent of the time . 
UNKNOWN Using the remote control , ninety eight percent of the time for changing channels , and that's for flickering through channels . 
UNKNOWN So if you have to say up , up , up , up , if you have to do that all the time , then people might get a bit fed up with that and they may return it . 
UNKNOWN However , oh , because the voice recognition software exists already , there's no need to spend money on research and development , but this does mean the need for microphones in the in the remote control , which is an unusual feature in my opinion . 
UNKNOWN But if we do have the voice recognition thing , there's a lot of stuff that you can uh get rid of . 
UNKNOWN See , you could there're two options . 
UNKNOWN Either you have voice recognition by itself , which I think is a bit impractical for like night time if you wanna be watching television and you wanna be quiet , or I don't know you have a visitor coming round and the remote's only trained for you , it's a bit impractical to have just voice recognition by itself . 
UNKNOWN So you can have voice recognition and a regular remote . 
UNKNOWN But imagine you got rid of the regular remote part , then you can design the remote to look any way you want it to look , because there are no restrictions on physical size , or shape , it it could be as fancy as you want it to be , you know , it could be like a lollipop or something like that , something weird like that . 
UNKNOWN As long as the voice recognition stuff works , that's that's fine . 
UNKNOWN Okay , yep . 
UNKNOWN So we have the three birds , we have the design , that we have the the fancy bit , right , the voice recognition's fancy , it's cool , it's different , it's radical , so , and then we have an extra bit I don't remember so I'm pretty sure people will buy the remote , but is it practical to have a voice recognition system in a remote control , I think is a big question . 
UNKNOWN Um , will people will people be willing to wait for the the period that it'll take to train the remote , 'cause I think it will the remote will uh get better over time with the same user user , but for the first week or for the first two weeks are you willing to wait , are you willing to have a bad remote control . 
UNKNOWN And uh what if you have visitors come round , they stay the night , they wanna use the T_V_ , they can't use the remote because they speak differently to you . 
UNKNOWN Um , how do you account for regional accents and stuff like that . 
UNKNOWN Uh , will people return the remote control , I think a lot of young people will buy the remote control , if they have the money , you know , so , do our audience have the money , but would they return it after a while because it's not as fast as pressing a button , it's not a practical . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So . 
UNKNOWN If you could uh sor if you could speed it up a bit , yeah . 
UNKNOWN These are things I think we should consider . 
UNKNOWN I think it's cool , I'm sorry ? 
UNKNOWN If you could uh speed it up a bit please , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Sure . 
UNKNOWN I'm about to end , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Sorry . 
CONFIRMATION Cool . 
UNKNOWN I think it's cool but there are definitely some considerations . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Excellent . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Hear from the User Interface Designer now I think might be an idea . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um , you've got your presentationnow , is it on the is it ? 
UNKNOWN How did where did where did you get all your in information ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , it's in the it's in the folder yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN There was uh a website , uh , right here . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN Ah , okay . 
UNKNOWN Technical functions ? 
CONFUSION Mm . 
NEGATION No . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN G I started making stuff up , then I got an emailsaying Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Okay , this is a brief run through of the um of the technical functions of the remote . 
UNKNOWN As um is uh the the the presentationis uh already slightly obsolete because I had in mind something that would uh be i be aimed at controlling multiple devices but uh there's still stuff of relevance , so press on . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN I've looked at looked at a num uh couple of other uh remote control models just for an idea of basic design principles . 
UNKNOWN Um and wasn't really satisfied by what I saw I have to say so this is more sort of springboard for uh how these could be improved on . 
UNKNOWN Um um basically the job of the device is to send commands to an appliance , in this case the television set . 
UNKNOWN Um to save you getting off your backside . 
UNKNOWN Um and there's two main trends in th in the sort of design practice . 
UNKNOWN On the one hand and this uh this particularly relates to its sort of earliest models where with you know i so so many buttons on it so about the size of the television set . 
UNKNOWN Um giving you every possible function that the that the device has , the remote control controls . 
UNKNOWN And most of these functions are not going to be used , it creates a rather user unfriendly interface . 
UNKNOWN And on the other hand there's a user focused approach that pares things down to just what what is most likely to get used . 
UNKNOWN Um With uh a and a and of course there is a certain amount of sort of loss of function here obviously , but mostly that's relatively peripheral functions . 
UNKNOWN And so you go for something that's fairly intuitive to use , and um well f the for the most part for T_V_ remote it's uh tha that would be channel control and volume . 
UNKNOWN Um and if you if you if you are wanting to incorporate uh control of a D_V_ D_V_D_ or uh V_C_R_ presumably into that then there's a play , pause , stop , rewind , fast-forward , record , so forth . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN My own view is that we should definitely be going for a user focused design . 
UNKNOWN Um but uh the pro I think the problem with a lot of the sort of user focused designsthat are about is that they sort of make assumptions in advance about what uh what a given user's going to uh want mo want to do from want it to do most . 
UNKNOWN So , something that's uh something that is more programmable , that uh perh perhaps has the full range of functions available to it but you can then specify yourself what you're most likely to want . 
UNKNOWN Um so that those are then immediately accessible through fairly minimal number of controls , um I liked Ebenezer's idea of including a joystick in that and uh possibly a sort of fairly minimal number of sort of function buttons , and have a disp you then have some sort of basic display on it so that if you're um sort of cha changing from different modes for the device it'll tell you just exactly what uh you know each direction of the uh of the um joystick's going to do or wha or what each function button's going to do . 
UNKNOWN Um , this is actually a again slightly taking inspiration off of uh games controllers , you know the Playstation control where you have four basic function buttons that are just marked with um distinctive uh geometrical shapes but the and then dependent on what you're doing with it what game and so on um those uh those functions are then sort of further specified . 
UNKNOWN And so it's taking taking the lead from that . 
CONFUSION Um . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN That's it . 
UNKNOWN Um , if we could hear from our Industrial engineer , or Designer . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh , I was still working on stuff , I hadn't got it finished . 
UNKNOWN Um , alright . 
UNKNOWN Click to save in where do I have to save it ? 
UNKNOWN If you look on the desktop you'll find that there's a link to the project folder , or project documents. 
UNKNOWN If you save it in there we can open it up from here . 
UNKNOWN Um , what I've done with it , I'm sorry . 
UNKNOWN Shit . 
UNKNOWN Um I'm just closing it now . 
UNKNOWN Are you finding it okay or ? 
UNKNOWN where I've saved it . 
UNKNOWN Well like if you go to one , uh whichever one you were working yeah , and you just click filesave as . 
UNKNOWN that's it there , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Oh right . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Uh , right I'm responsible for working design , uh , this is basically the inside going on of the the uh remote control . 
UNKNOWN So we have the energy source , we have the user interface , this this is what I've seen . 
UNKNOWN Uh the sender will push the button , the chip will respond , uh and then the dig digital signal is sent to the T_V_ . 
UNKNOWN So uh uh , if you go to next slide, you'll see you'll see uh what do we need on the user interface . 
UNKNOWN Do we need uh many buttons , or do we need l many light bulbs that could be easier to uh to realise which appliances are on or not . 
UNKNOWN Um , , or would that take too much power , would we need more um components in there to supply the power ? 
UNKNOWN Um , the joystick is another thing , if we were gonna add that , um , there'd be more components to deal with that . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um , so uh we need to I dunno exactly what That's the design of the the the layoutof the uh electronic design , but um obviously there'll be more details once we've decided what we're putting on the user interface . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So , that'll be decided , I guess . 
UNKNOWN Uh , and the next slide. 
UNKNOWN Oh , yeah Um , if you go to the next slidethen . 
SURPRISE Oh .
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I just used the it was a mess , uh I was just putting adding it together at the end there . 
UNKNOWN Ah , don't worry about it at all mate . 
UNKNOWN Uh Uh so you have the energy source obviously connected to the chip , and the user interface obviously contains everything . 
UNKNOWN You have the switch turn it on , infrared bulb , uh will contact the T_V_ and will have whatever device or D_V_D_ player , the bulb will turn on to say it's on . 
UNKNOWN Uh , so do we need on the control uh different buttons to decide , or different light bulbs , would it be easier ? 
UNKNOWN Um , I dunno what we should decide on that . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Well . 
UNKNOWN Oh sorry , I'm I'm interrupting you . 
UNKNOWN Are you is it yeah ? 
UNKNOWN No , it's finished , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Um , right we can probably skip that for now . 
UNKNOWN So , we've had some stuff put forward , um along with the new user requirements , um we've had a lot of kind of input I'd say so far . 
UNKNOWN Um I hear what the Marketing Expert's saying about um voice activated control . 
UNKNOWN However I've got a couple of worries about that . 
UNKNOWN The power required , um and the ability to the cost , it seems like for uh an embedded system , this could cause us issues . 
UNKNOWN Cost . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Um for example you see that there's fairly robust services on uh computers via uh via voice , I_B_M_ do um drag and dictate , but these require a lot of memory and usually um state quite advanced processor requirements . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um voice activation could be an interesting idea but I think that our Ind Industrial Designer would probably upon some research say that it's maybe not feasible . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN Um that's just my view right now , however the idea of a joystick and then maybe an L_C_D_ which has been kind of put forward so far , it's almost like having a small T_ not T_V_ to say , but if you can control almost all of the functionality from the display , I don't know how much power an L_C_D_ would take , but it might be quite low ? 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN L_C_D_ on the remote just telling you what's on , or uh , interactive L_C_D_ or Do you think that people will get mixed up , like , they'll be looking at this screen and that screen and then , you know , trying to get everything working , would it be a bit confusing ? 
UNKNOWN I uh Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Well literally um if you can imagine the display maybe slightly larger than um those on a a mobile phone , something where you can read an an um fair amount of information , traverse maybe quite a few menus , if we maybe used mobile phones as a good example , they usually incorporate they have the keypad , and then evr all the other functionality is usually associated inside by traversing around . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN That could be one possibility . 
UNKNOWN Um and then we could have like say the common buttons as you say , volume control , changing channels We I would agree with you . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN I I was thinking that the remote the um sort of default functions for the joystick would be up and down for uh volume , left and right for channels . 
UNKNOWN Um I think probably for the first couple of hours of using it um but you know muscle memory's a wonderful thing , um . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN And I think and I think that size of uh display was about what I had in mind . 
UNKNOWN Um though I mean I w I would say that uh we could probably probably be required to um mo most of the mobile phone displays you see these days are colour but we should probably try to stick to black and white . 
UNKNOWN Si si simply to keep m keep the unit cost down . 
UNKNOWN Um I mean colour could be a sort of subsequent development but uh you know cost a bit of extra money f w w w w w once everyone's got the first , you know , oh colour's out , we'll have to replace it won't we . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN It does nothing extra . 
UNKNOWN That would be my feeling as well , I think we could possibly create quite a useful user interface . 
UNKNOWN Um now I mean I don't sorry , go for it . 
UNKNOWN Sure but the idea of a remote with a menu or and a joystick I think like I h if I was in the habit of buying remote controls then I would want one , but I think we don't have a specific audience , you know , like what is our target audience , what niche are niche are we trying to market and corner . 
UNKNOWN You know , you know what I'm saying , like , for whom is this intended ? 
UNKNOWN Everybody ? 
UNKNOWN I think it could probably be aimed at most people who've used a mobile . 
UNKNOWN And that might be just another way of saying try to target most people . 
UNKNOWN Most people , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um , if we are if we were to follow that avenue , we might be s you know um we're kind of almost relying on their experience with a mobile phone I suppose . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN But that does cover a very large section of the people out there . 
CONFIRMATION Sure . 
UNKNOWN I think that's fair yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um , I mean I imagine as well that the actual L_C_D_ and maybe to a certain extent the joystick as well would be for the additional functionality . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Which maybe doesn't get used as often , maybe it makes it easy for them to figure out how to um change the channels as in the frequencies and such for reprogramming it . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um and you can still have the main buttons that allow the people to turn the machine on and off , d up and down , it depends , I mean maybe we have the fol um the joystick as a separate one for the other functions then , that there's just a a small number of as you were saying uh buttons that have already been defined . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So like we go for the nice standard um up and down for and volume control . 
UNKNOWN So that literally anybody can come along , pick up the remote and still know what do do . 
UNKNOWN And they can completely ignore most of the functionality which would be for say the o actual owner of the the T_V_ and who would normally use the unit . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN I dunno . 
UNKNOWN I th the thing I like about the uh the uh joystick is that uh you you you then basically you can then basically put it I mean for for T_ T_ for T_V_ remote alone , you could put um I mean there are like I say the the the main things people do with a T_V_ remote control is the volume and the channel . 
UNKNOWN You can pack all that onto was onto a single control . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN But uh but the but then o uh obviously if uh you know if you i if you wanted to access further functions i you you then get to sort of menu navigation . 
UNKNOWN I mean with things like ch with things like tuning and channels um you know adjusting brightn uh brightness and fiddly things that no one really bothers with , most T_V_s these days actually have menus anyway so this would be a fairly rational way of integra integrating the uh the remote with the device it's controlling . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um concern about our market . 
UNKNOWN Um , if we are I mean most of the uh of the replacement remote market is sort of remote control rationalisation . 
UNKNOWN Um , you've got twenty different devices in your living room , you want one wo y you want one that'll do the job of all of them . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um , if all you're replacing is one of the you know however many remotes you have in your living room , um you know you still need separate remotes for everything else . 
UNKNOWN I just think that uh possibly mm . 
UNKNOWN Well this is a requirement that we have to stick to I'm afraid , this isn't one that I've just arbitrarily decided on . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN So um this is this is one of the solid ones that has to be obeyed , for now . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN So I can understand your point , and I would agree with you , but this is our design spec for now . 
UNKNOWN 'Fraid to say . 
UNKNOWN Um I would say so , yes , because then we have to be able to control the remote boxes , and that is a separate unit . 
UNKNOWN Does that um would that include um access to say interactive functions on digital or cable ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um I think that it I would say that the design spec we've been with is for the television only for now . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN And until we hear otherwise we should go with just that . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Okay , specifically television . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Maybe we'll hear differently , but for now It would be ease of manipulation of certain functions , yes . 
UNKNOWN So the joystick is just for differentness . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Just a thought . 
UNKNOWN Um There is that possibility , yes . 
UNKNOWN Um maybe then our market should be T_V_ manufacturers , rather than the public . 
UNKNOWN Try and sell it t sell it to them to supply with um Mm , yeah , I've seen them . 
UNKNOWN B However I don't know exactly where we'll be going with that , but it might not even be the avenue of the Marketing Expert , that might be sales , who are not in this meeting . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN It's just , the way I figure it , twelve point five Euros per unit , we have to sell at least like three million or something like that , not to account for all the the money we waste on remotes that no one buys , you know , like if we made a perf if we made a ks for every remote we made someone bought it , then we have to sell a lot of remote controls . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN We just Is this gonna be enough to to sell ? 
UNKNOWN Well , something else that you brought up was uh the ability to lose a remote , which as you said you've done , in fact we've probably all done . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um , I don't know if it's a gimmick or not , but have any of you ever seen those odd little key rings where if you whistle , it will beep and you tell you where it is . 
UNKNOWN I had one of those , and my brother , and my dad , could have beat me up because it it went off all the time accidentally . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Well the other option of course is that um the well I was going to say clapping , um Um digital telephones , uh for example , one unit has of course you have to have that base unit , somewhere where there's a button , but maybe it's a button that you attach to the T_V_ . 
UNKNOWN The clapping one . 
UNKNOWN To a television . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Something which you when you press that , it would beep to give its location away , on the remote unit . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And that could be something could um separate us a bit . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I think that's a good idea . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's a good idea . 
UNKNOWN And that way , because we're attaching what would be a small button to the T_V_ , again say what , it would be a small transmitter , um watch battery type scenario I would say , or something that if it was problems enough you could actually even just um I don't power that might be something that we could look into . 
UNKNOWN Yeah We're just saying volume . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , it's uh putting a lot on your shoulders there , so I mean that could be something that separates us a bit from the market as well . 
UNKNOWN I think so , yeah . 
UNKNOWN So . 
UNKNOWN To go on from here . 
UNKNOWN Um we have to decide exactly what we're going to do with the remote . 
UNKNOWN Before we leave this meeting , it would be best to say this is what we're going this is the design we're gonna try and get , this is how we're gonna make ourselves look unique . 
UNKNOWN Do we go for maybe a remote contro uh sorry , we're gonna go for a remote control obviously , do we go for a small joystick that would operate say changing channels , up and down , and then , what , another button that would say that it's now being used to manoeuvre round the L_C_D_ . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Mm yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I think that's Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Should volume be important in the joystick , do you think ? 
UNKNOWN We could use say the left and right for changing channels and the up and down for volume , and Okay . 
UNKNOWN For volume . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN But we have a frequency of how what people use a remote control for most . 
UNKNOWN Um , power is used like once per hour , channel selection is used a hundred and sixty eight per hour , that's by far the biggest one , and then teletext , is still here , that's like fourteen , and volume selection . 
UNKNOWN I Yeah , think so . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Vol Volume selection okay , yep , the teletext we're gambling with , and we're gonna say it's dead , the way of the dodo So we well , sorry , we could maybe even go as far as saying power button , small joystick , L_C_D_ , and then what maybe is it one more button to say that you're using the menu system , and with the possibility of pushing down on the joystick to say okay ? 
UNKNOWN No , yeah , okay okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , um Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So we're having very very few buttons involved , but navigation around a menu for most things . 
UNKNOWN Actually how Actually I would say maybe two two function buttons , the y we're now using the menus button and um and an og and an okay button . 
UNKNOWN I mean certainly something I've found with the joystick on mo the joysticks on mobile phones is that a lot of the time th the device mistakes you trying to move it in one direction or the other for pushing down for okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Or vice versa . 
UNKNOWN And that's really irritating . 
UNKNOWN Um Okay . 
UNKNOWN The o the o the other dis design constraint I think we should bear in mind is that people are you know very much used to using a remote control one handedly , um , so we need to make sure that e even with the joystick , you know something that can just sit comfortably in the palm of the hand and have the joystick just controlled by the thumb . 
UNKNOWN So um we're actually that sounds like a rough idea . 
UNKNOWN Do we incorporate the idea of trying to f locate the remote control again via a beeping noise ? 
UNKNOWN Do you mind looking ? 
UNKNOWN Um , I think because it's so small it might be an uh I mean if we only have like two three buttons it might be essential to have to have that Yeah . 
UNKNOWN The ability to locate it again . 
UNKNOWN So that would require a um transmitter maybe attached to the T_V_ , just so that it says find me , and what , a basically a small microphone um on the actual unit , can maybe hide it in the base . 
UNKNOWN Light bulb as well , no ? 
SURPRISE Oh .
CONFUSION Sorry ? 
UNKNOWN So so a small speaker you mean . 
UNKNOWN Speaker yeah . 
UNKNOWN Some speaker , sorry , yeah . 
UNKNOWN And a light bulb ? 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN To flash . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN Um E us we might be better with the sound possibly we could maybe incorporate th e the true fact , considering the cost of an L_E_D_ , we could just incorporate it anyway . 
UNKNOWN Nah , you'd see it anyway , if you hear it . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN W those little key-rings have both , so Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN The L_E_D_s can be surprisingly bright now . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Blue ones particularly . 
UNKNOWN Plus that's a nice wee design touch . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So by the sounds of it , with what we're suggesting so far , your design um the user interface is still quite open , you could go for quite an interesting design . 
UNKNOWN Because we're only going to have a very few key and you've got you know a small L_C_D_ , joystick , e I think it leaves you open to a a potential wide range of shapes , something that can make it stand out slightly . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um if you could look into what we've suggested so far , the feasibility of um small transmitter , um and such , maybe if an L_C_D_ screen requires too much power , or such . 
UNKNOWN Ebenezer , um , Marketing Expert If , yeah if you could maybe as well see what people think about the idea of this minimalist approach that we've taken , where of a joystick to control the very basic functions , and then the idea of manipulating it like you would a mobile . 
UNKNOWN Well I can give you the frequency , what people what options people use most often , I guess that's gonna be important in the ts defining the the software side of the interface , right . 
UNKNOWN You want the stuff . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN I don't know how easy that will be within the time frame , but could be something we could maybe look into . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Sure . 
CONFIRMATION Sure . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um any last comments that anybody would like to put forward ? 
UNKNOWN Anything that they think has been missed out . 
UNKNOWN Bit of a wide open question there of course . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Feel free to emailme if you think that uh we've screwed something up and wanna get it rectified as soon as possible . 
CONFIRMATION Sure . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So I should just look at um the speaker , the speaker and an L_E_D_ . 
UNKNOWN And Yeah , and a transmitter . 
UNKNOWN Speaker and L_E_D_ for locating , um , transmitter getting the external power source , yep , that's quite true . 
UNKNOWN Transmitter . 
UNKNOWN Actually one one wee thought about that . 
UNKNOWN Um , if we do end up trying to market this to television manufacturers then the um then the transmitter could actually be built into the television . 
UNKNOWN Um , and something that we can can easily be adopted at the last minuteas well I'd say . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN The electronics could be s either placed externally or internally , makes no difference to the final product of the actual remote control , so that's good . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Uses maybe gives us a new potential market . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN You know I think I mean if it w if we get a major television manufacturer to say y oh yeah we'll have that , save us the bother , then that's you know vast amounts of sales . 
UNKNOWN P Fashion . 
UNKNOWN Quite quickly . 
UNKNOWN Oh , one thing that we've almost not talked about at all , my apologies for that , um , user interface , we also need to maybe get the slogan in here , um it's , I'm pointing at my laptop , what in God Real reaction , and such . 
UNKNOWN So um Oh , sorry . 
UNKNOWN The slogan is yeah , the slogan's we put the fashion in electronics , isn't it ? 
UNKNOWN My apologies . 
UNKNOWN No it could well be , I've probably missed that . 
UNKNOWN Um , I think that's l almost the last minutething we can just incorporate into the actual plastic on top . 
UNKNOWN 'S also look cool . 
UNKNOWN So I'm not too concerned a that we haven't gone into depth about that . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN But it might be something you could consider when you're thinking about shapes ? 
UNKNOWN In fact we might like to put a slogan on , and um possibly the two R_s to signify the company . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Rather than real reaction . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I thought the uh the d the double arc could perhaps uh be the uh the enter button . 
UNKNOWN Sounds good . 
UNKNOWN And I'd say that that's us for now . 
UNKNOWN . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Alright , yeah . 
UNKNOWN crack on . 
UNKNOWN Okay so we'll start off with a quick overview of the minutes. 
UNKNOWN I think to sum up the last meeting , would be to say um the requirements that we've um set out . 
UNKNOWN Those are we were going to go for what seemed to be a fairly minimal design based on uh a small joystick , L_C_D_ and a couple of other buttons for navigation um with power being I suppose one of the main single purpose buttons . 
UNKNOWN Um we were also going to use novelty of being able to locate the remote control again via a small transmitter with any luck , the idea to try and separate us and also because of the minimal design um looks like we'll be able to be fairly adventurous in the actual physical shape of our remote control with any luck . 
UNKNOWN Um that pretty much sums up the last one . 
UNKNOWN So we'll just crack on , um like to maybe start with the Industrial Designer if it's possible . 
UNKNOWN Um uh the con today is the concep today . 
UNKNOWN I'll just Uh I have a presentationI just saved it in the uh the folder . 
UNKNOWN This uh meeting is the conceptual design phase and is um Sorry about this . 
UNKNOWN . 
UNKNOWN And is to cover things like um what the parts might be made of , um , can we uh outsource these from elsewhere , um will we have to construct any items ourselves ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , okay well I'll just uh I'll load it up then . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Which one do y Oh , interface concept ? 
CONFUSION Uh . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's me . 
CONFUSION Uh . 
UNKNOWN That's you . 
UNKNOWN We've got trend watching , that's you . 
UNKNOWN It's uh Components design . 
UNKNOWN Components design . 
UNKNOWN . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
UNKNOWN So Uh . 
UNKNOWN The case uh le that's what I wrote first of all , could be plastic our plastic . 
UNKNOWN Uh but later on we found out that um it can be rubber as well , or titanium or even wood . 
UNKNOWN So uh we decide what it's gonna be . 
UNKNOWN Probably plastic . 
UNKNOWN Uh we need the infra-red transmitter . 
UNKNOWN Get that off the shelf . 
UNKNOWN Uh joystick we'll probably if we're gonna use it , um could be plastic w or rubber even as well . 
UNKNOWN Um if you go on to the next slide. 
UNKNOWN Uh If you go on to f uh findings , it's like two or three slidesdown . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So , this is what I found we can use . 
UNKNOWN Uh three different types of batteries . 
UNKNOWN Um can either use a hand dynamo , or the kinetic type ones , you know that they use in watches , or else uh a solar powered one . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Now , the kinetic one , we've 'cause that's the ones where like you the movement causes it . 
UNKNOWN Cost is Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um the bat uh the battery for a a watch wouldn't require a lot of power , would be my one query . 
UNKNOWN Is a kinetic one going to be able to supply enough power ? 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN There's also a watch moves around a great deal more . 
UNKNOWN Do you think ? 
CONFUSION Uh . 
UNKNOWN W Which I suppose as well would allow us to go off the shelf again , you'd say ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I don't think it would . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN And solar cells , I dunno about that . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Uh . 
UNKNOWN We should probably just use conventional batteries . 
UNKNOWN Um , just like in usual remote controls . 
CONFUSION Um . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN And these are three different types of or two different types three different types of shapes you can have . 
UNKNOWN Uh one is a flat one , and then more original ones are single curved one or one with a double curved . 
UNKNOWN Um the materials are tha there as you can see , but uh you can't have a titanium one for a double curved , uh which would be Yeah , and light . 
UNKNOWN Titanium , the really strong metal , titanium ? 
UNKNOWN Is it not also it's expensive ? 
UNKNOWN Uh , i think so as well , yeah . 
UNKNOWN They make mountain bikes out of that , don't they . 
CONFUSION Um . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN So it's really light as well . 
UNKNOWN Curious . 
UNKNOWN Um , I don't know if you'd be able to off the top of your head or not , the single curved and double curved , would you be able to give an example ? 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Um could you maybe drawsomething ? 
UNKNOWN T yeah . 
UNKNOWN I you don't doesn't have to be perfect , it's just 'cause I'm not quite sure if I understand the difference between the two . 
CONFUSION Uh . 
UNKNOWN Well for a curved , well I was thinking to f for to sit in your the palm of your hand . 
UNKNOWN Uh maybe like this , with the uh joy pad here . 
UNKNOWN Joystick here . 
UNKNOWN And maybe um an okay button around here , so that the thumb can uh use it quite easily . 
UNKNOWN Um I don't exactly Double curved . 
UNKNOWN It probably means this is probably double curved . 
UNKNOWN Uh whereas a single curved would be like that . 
UNKNOWN I guess . 
UNKNOWN Or not necessarily . 
UNKNOWN So it might literally just be okay . 
UNKNOWN Two curves . 
UNKNOWN Yeah like that . 
UNKNOWN Whereas this is two curves . 
UNKNOWN Um so I guess that's what they mean by uh double curve . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
UNKNOWN Um which obviously it looks better than the single curve , but uh you can't have it in titanium , which is uh a nice material . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Uh and for the buttons , um it can have the scroll wheel which they use in mouses for com P_C_s . 
UNKNOWN Uh but um it requires a more expensive chip to use , and if you wanna use L_C_D_ it's even more expensive . 
UNKNOWN So you have to decide , there's trade-offs there . 
UNKNOWN Um if you want the buttons to be oh yeah , if you have a double curve uh control and it's rubber , then you have these rubber buttons as well . 
UNKNOWN But you're gonna ha I reckon you're gonna have to have uh key a number keypad anyway for the amount of channels these days . 
UNKNOWN You wouldn't want to just have to scroll through all the channels to get to the one you want . 
UNKNOWN You wanna enter just the number of it , if you know it . 
UNKNOWN So um I reckon we're gonna have to have a number keypad anyway . 
UNKNOWN Do you think ? 
UNKNOWN Okay , that was definitely something we can talk about . 
UNKNOWN Um so you've got a little bit about the the chip that we might require as well ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So , depends where gonna spend the money if you want the f fancy L_C_D_ display . 
UNKNOWN Um , do you have any idea so far , like when we're saying that we'd need an advanced chip for an L_C_D_ , does that in shoot the cost up by a drastic amount ? 
UNKNOWN Or ? 
UNKNOWN Need an advanced chip for the L_C_D_ . 
UNKNOWN Is that did I Advanced , like three eight six advance . 
UNKNOWN Well I think compared to say just pressing buttons . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN if you press a button that sends a certain transmission through the infra-red , whereas I think if we're controlling the L_C_D_ we definitely require a much more powerful chip . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Just compared to the chip you would use for pushing buttons I think is the the point being made . 
UNKNOWN Okay , sure . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN If I've not over-stepped . 
UNKNOWN Yeah ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah i Um Uh the previous slidesjust explain what's in the internal components of the uh remote control . 
UNKNOWN Okay , um should I go on , or go back ? 
UNKNOWN Mm , if we only have twelve Pounds fifty , twelve Euros , not even twelve Pounds . 
UNKNOWN Twelve Euros , what's that , like eight pounds or something like that , nine Pounds ? 
UNKNOWN Well we'd also be relying on the um the bulk buying in producement and such . 
UNKNOWN Okay , that's good point . 
UNKNOWN I assume . 
UNKNOWN We have to look into the costs of those . 
UNKNOWN So , sorry . 
UNKNOWN If you go to the one before that uh so it just says what it does , translate the key press into an infra-red signal and this is received by the T_V_ . 
UNKNOWN Uh the chip just needs to detect the signal or detect the key press and then uh it'll send it to the tr the amplifier . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN And uh then the next slidejust shows how the uh copper wires uh interact with the buttons , the rubber buttons , uh to uh get sent to the chip . 
UNKNOWN So that's just how the control works inside . 
UNKNOWN Um we have to decide on what buttons we're gonna use . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN . 
UNKNOWN So in the information that you've been supplied , how feasible would you say that the idea of using an L_C_D_ looks ? 
UNKNOWN Um I think we can do it if uh we use conventional batteries and not have solar cells or kinetic . 
UNKNOWN Um and then maybe use single curved uh case . 
UNKNOWN Because we might need it to be curved for the uh thumb to use the joyst joystick easily . 
UNKNOWN Um and then you'll need the advanced chip obviously for the L_C_D_ . 
UNKNOWN Um I mean that sounds like quite a good requirement to me . 
UNKNOWN Um conventional battery would seem to make sense . 
UNKNOWN Um I'm not sure if there's any cost differences between single and double curved and I'm I don't know about anybody else , but plastic or rubber as a traditional form of casing would seem to be a good way forward ? 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Um I'm actually gonna be bold and go oo go straight for rubber um for reasons I'll go into uh in more detail . 
UNKNOWN . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN I also have a preference for rubber . 
UNKNOWN Okay , well um Yeah , well will we move on to user interface , and yeah ? 
UNKNOWN Based on my research . 
UNKNOWN . 
UNKNOWN Um sorry , as long as were you ? 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Yep I'm finished . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um and d d d interface concept . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN Now I'm gonna have to work between the uh the slidesand the uh and the white board 'cause I actually I have some fairly concrete things this time . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh um I was given a an H_T_M_L_ filegiving um various ideas from uh from other previous remote control designs, and pretty much decided to just dump them all . 
UNKNOWN I wasn't very impressed by them and they didn't seem to re uh nothing I saw seemed to meet the sorts of design specifications that we're going for today . 
UNKNOWN Um so what I ra rather than looking at other remotes , uh ra oomp be better to simply look at the human hand . 
UNKNOWN Um and try and f um and try and figure out a way of laying out the elements we've already decided on , um so that if r a if so that the finger is e each finger or thumb is wherever it needs to be already . 
UNKNOWN Um so uh next slide, if you please . 
UNKNOWN Um and what we've basically decided on was the the um the joy uh the joystick , two function buttons and the L_C_D_ , just keep it paired down to the absolute minimum . 
UNKNOWN I don't actually think we need the um the numeric keypad because if you m because one of the menus that we could have available um v via via the L_C_D_ is one where you scroll through channels , so if there's something f and be bear in mind since this isn't meant to work for um f f f for di for digital or um or for or for cable , whatever , you're basically looking at four or five terrestrial channels , and then um your V_C_ uh and then the channel through your V_C_R_ and or D_V_D_ player . 
UNKNOWN digital . 
UNKNOWN Ah , okay . 
UNKNOWN And or um box . 
UNKNOWN So it's not I'm not really excessively concerned about that . 
UNKNOWN You must have two two modes , basic mode , where um the joystick's uh left right left right for channels , up down for volume , um and the uh uh and the menu mode for uh further functions . 
UNKNOWN Um now the reason I was particularly interested in using rubber for this is that if we're going to have a highly ergonomic design , um it needs to be ergonomic for left or right handed people . 
UNKNOWN Um , so you Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Can I just jump in slightly there ? 
UNKNOWN That would suggest the double curved design's probably going to be most appropriate , then . 
UNKNOWN Yes , absolutely . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um , basi basically what I basically what the what be having um , I would say , the the whole thing articulated at two points , so that if you if you're handing it from a lef uh left or right handed user you can adjust it so that the um the L_C_ the L_C_D_ and the uh The joystick would be in the right place . 
UNKNOWN And also this is a rather nicer de uh design gimmick that the the um you know the whole thing you know it should have sort of organic feel to it that it should be , you know , soft to touch and can be moved around all nice . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Um okay on to on to the next uh to the next slide. 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Just to let you know we'll probably be quite tight for time as well , because I think you've probably got a lot you'd like to say , I guess . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , 'kay basically um I can add pretty pictures to this . 
UNKNOWN The um Assuming the hand the hand to be in about sort of this position , um hol uh holding the remote , the um the joystick unit should rest over the uh the joint of the f of the uh four finger so that it's directly accessible for the thumb . 
UNKNOWN Um and it would need t there would need to be a it would need to be articulated just below that so that it could be switched around for uh left or right handed users . 
UNKNOWN So . 
UNKNOWN You then have a grip section that can be more or less the same irrespective of handedness . 
UNKNOWN You just have big two big buttons that cover most of the area so it can in the upper part , one for the four finger , one for the middle finger . 
UNKNOWN Um , and that Th this part here is the joystick . 
UNKNOWN Is this the joystick ? 
UNKNOWN This would be the actual grip . 
UNKNOWN Probably where you'd want to have the battery as well . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN That would be probably the bulkiest part . 
UNKNOWN And you then have , at the uh at the bottom , the L_C_D_ , and this would need to be articulated as well . 
UNKNOWN And basically I'd want this to rest here , right at the base of the wrist . 
UNKNOWN So it would fit just nicely in the hand . 
UNKNOWN And again , this part could be rotated , so it can So so so that it can be adjusted to either left or right handed user . 
UNKNOWN Um So the t uh the top function button in basic mode would be the on off switch and menu mode would be the enter button . 
UNKNOWN And then the bottom function buttons switches between between modes . 
UNKNOWN Um now programming it actually thi this is one thing I've found with um the replacement remote control . 
UNKNOWN Programming them can be a right pain . 
UNKNOWN So I thought th the simplest way around that would be to have um a cable to connect it to the computer some some fair iv fairly fairly simple software on the computer just so that you on your computer just so that you could um pr program it at a rather in a rather more comfortable interface . 
UNKNOWN And you could download programs for it from uh for uh T_V_s from all sort of main manufacturers . 
UNKNOWN Um though you i it would be necessary to have uh have a m uh have a ha have a mode for programming it without the computer , uh just in case there are there are still people left out there who don't have them yet . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN But uh . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN That's that's my idea . 
UNKNOWN Excellent , right . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Um uh . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN Fileopen . 
UNKNOWN We go . 
UNKNOWN Trend watching . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So uh to gather my research , two basic methods . 
UNKNOWN We compared uh whether people want the remote control to do a lot of stuff or they want it to look cool . 
UNKNOWN And then we we research uh fashion trends in Europe , what's what's the new black , you know , as it goes . 
UNKNOWN Next slideplease . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Uh we found , in order of importance , people want the remote control to look cool more than they want it to to be cool . 
UNKNOWN As in they want it to do a lot of good s they want it to look like it does a lot , and if it does do a lot that's a bonus , but they don't care so much , you know . 
UNKNOWN They want it to be that's sounds a bit like a contradiction . 
UNKNOWN Technology technical technologically innovative . 
UNKNOWN People want it to be that , but s still they care more about the way it looks than what it does . 
UNKNOWN So like the interface is really important . 
UNKNOWN And easy to use , it it just so happens that uh from the second point to the third point is twice as important I mean the second point is twice as important as the third point . 
UNKNOWN People want it I is it has to be cooler than easy to use , you know , if it has the newest features , even if it's difficult to use , prefer it to have the newest features . 
UNKNOWN And if it's easy to use that's a bonus . 
UNKNOWN The fashion , now this is seems a bit odd to me , but fruit and veg is the new is the new black for furniture , for clothes , for shoes . 
UNKNOWN How that relates to a remote control I don't know . 
UNKNOWN But I I see I come on to that in the next in the next slide. 
UNKNOWN Spongy . 
UNKNOWN I've als I've been saying everything's the new black . 
UNKNOWN Well spongy's the new black as well . 
UNKNOWN So we have the choice between rubber and plastic . 
UNKNOWN If it's the type of rubber that you can squeeze , you know , it's spongy , then can I skip the rest ? 
UNKNOWN Oh yeah , I forgot to mention that . 
UNKNOWN The uh rubber material is the type of stress ball material , not just normal rubber . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so kinda spongy material . 
UNKNOWN Forgot to say that . 
UNKNOWN So um so my personal opinion ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um we want something fancy and techni technologically innovative , obviously . 
UNKNOWN But what we what we need is something that looks like it's from the future that looks cool , that's that's different , you know , that's everyone has a white remote control , black remote control , you need something cool . 
UNKNOWN Like , titanium is cool but it's expensive . 
UNKNOWN And maybe it's a bit of overkill for a remote control . 
UNKNOWN Um now the fruit and veg options , either we we go in that direction or we stay totally away from it . 
UNKNOWN Um I mean the research did come up with fruit and veg , so maybe it is important for it's the up to the interface guy . 
UNKNOWN So if we stay away from it , s you know stay away from it , but if we're gonna go along with it then it doesn't necessarily have to be like an apple or something like that , or a kiwi fruit . 
UNKNOWN It could be something like , I say potato peeler but I'm sure you guys have a have a much cooler idea than I do . 
UNKNOWN So I think cool is the key . 
UNKNOWN Few questions about a spongy remote control . 
UNKNOWN I've never seen one before . 
UNKNOWN I've seen plastic remote controls . 
UNKNOWN I think maybe they were I don't know , back in the day when they first came up with remote controls , they had a reason for it being sturdy , you know . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN For being strong and sturdy . 
UNKNOWN So um if we want something strong and sturdy , I say stay with plastic or titanium , but if we go with spongy , we can stress that you can drop this as many times as you want , it doesn't matter , it's spongy material , it's not gonna break , you know . 
UNKNOWN I just don't know how the L_E_D_ and the lights are gonna fit into a spongy material because it's not gonna be completely squeezable . 
UNKNOWN So how do things fit it ? 
UNKNOWN And if we are gonna use spongy , we can say it's long lasting , you know it's damage resistant and stuff like that , so . 
UNKNOWN So just to summarise , people want stuff that's cool , that's that looks like it's cool , and if it is cool then that's a bonus doesn't have to be um people like fruit and veg . 
UNKNOWN We can either go down that alley or stay totally away from it . 
UNKNOWN People like spongy material . 
UNKNOWN If we're gonna use spongy material we have to think of how practical it is , and how we can further promote that idea . 
UNKNOWN And also , this was this year . 
UNKNOWN So , things change all the time , every year you know they they always talk about this year , this is the new black . 
UNKNOWN Well next year something else is gonna be the new black and we're stuck with last year's fruit and veg type stuff . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN That's me . 
UNKNOWN Well , um I would say that the most you could probably hope for is gaining a year's lead on most people anyway . 
UNKNOWN You always have to bring out new designs, so if we can get next year then that's possibly a good place to start anyway . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Seems like a a lot of the components could be off the shelf , so I don't exactly what cost would be incurred . 
UNKNOWN Um I can see your point about the number keypad , but I've I would say that we can probably incorporate it into the menu system if you need to do traversal of a large number of channels . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN My feeling would be that even if at a later date this was to be taking control of um boxes as well um having the use of the L_C_D_ and the joystick would probably allow you to manipulate enough channel numbers for you to be Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , actually if you've got a lot of channels , the number keypad can be quite annoying as well , becau it's you know if you're trying to remember what uh , you know , what number's the discovery channel or whatever . 
UNKNOWN It's just irritating . 
UNKNOWN That's a good point . 
UNKNOWN You can incorporate names into the menu . 
UNKNOWN But if you h but but but if you have a me but if you have a menu structure , then you can sub-group them . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So you Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Even news , music . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Like they do on uh sky digital kinda . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So what it looks like to me is we'll use a large number of standard components , um , say something like um lithium ion battery , the kind that you find in most um small hand held devices now . 
UNKNOWN Um Looks like we going for a double curved design . 
UNKNOWN Um I don't know what cost implications there are in that . 
UNKNOWN Um , looks like we're pretty much decided on some kind of flexible rubber . 
UNKNOWN Though I'd have to say depending on how flexible it is , we might need to have some kind of inner frame . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I I would say definitely , I mean I mean I mean the the idea of having it sort of articulated i th there would be basically two points of articulation . 
UNKNOWN W um one below and one above the m the uh the main sort of grip . 
UNKNOWN Do you think there's any way we could maybe remove the articulation ? 
UNKNOWN So Mm . 
UNKNOWN I can see why it looks appealing , but it could be a weak point in um the structure , do you think ? 
UNKNOWN That would be a worry of mine . 
UNKNOWN If you're going with the fruit and veg thing , looks like a banana . 
UNKNOWN F if you wanna design it that way . 
UNKNOWN . 
UNKNOWN I d I don't thi I don't think that it would be a a structural weakness , I mean if you have a firm s sub-structure , you can then incorporate articulation into that . 
UNKNOWN If you then have a sort of outer skin of mm flexible , spongy rubber then you have something that is you know very much you know organic , and I think would look rather co I mean mi rather cool . 
UNKNOWN I mean my drawingthere doesn't doesn't do it justice , it makes it makes it look more a little bit more like a vibrator than a than a uh than a remote control , but uh . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , we won't add that functionality . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Course not . 
UNKNOWN However , one interesting point is , I don't know how serious you were there , but we if we take some of the ideas why don't we make the damn thing yellow to incorporate the des the colour of the logo ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Sure , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN I dunno . 
UNKNOWN It's an certainly a different colour from your average um That's true . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Make it harder to lose , as well . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Sure . 
UNKNOWN Was there anything in your research Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN The noise for when you lose the banana , um f yeah , for when you lose the remote control , it could be like a a monkey noise or something like that , rather than a standard beep beep . 
UNKNOWN Y you know , you lose the monkey the banana , y you lose the banana , you press a button , and you hear like monkey screams or something like that to direct you towards the banana . 
UNKNOWN monkey . 
UNKNOWN I th uh I mean if it I think that's something that could perhaps be programmable , though maybe have monkey as default . 
UNKNOWN S oh , I was gonna talk about the programmable remote control . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Now I think it'd be cool if you had one remote control that could work with all T_V_s , you know you s you click a button and it finds the frequency that works with your particular television . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN But why you'd need to program it like as as a standard feature , I I don't know . 
UNKNOWN Well basi basically the um for f for uh I mean e each manufacturer will have a partic will have a particular command set that uh the T_V_ responds to . 
UNKNOWN It's not simply a matter of frequency . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So um usually what's done is you have this big booklet full of different possi you'll have all of them sort of programmed in to the uh remote , and you'll have this little booklet of codes you then find your um ma uh find your manufacturer and try the different codes that come under that manufacturer's name 'til you find the right one . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN That's because televisions , they don't give the remote control any type of feedback when you send it . 
UNKNOWN It's Yeah , that's right . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So that's that's quite annoying and we probably would still have to do that . 
UNKNOWN But if we had um some sort of hook-up to your computer as an option , then if you've got a computer you can avoid that rather irritating thing . 
UNKNOWN An interesting point is that if the person doesn't have the computer , we can still make the process easier because instead of having to look up codes , maybe we can have it that one of the options they have is that they look up the name of the company on the L_C_D_ and then they maybe look up different names of um different actual units that have been produced . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Or we have the remote control just go through them until it's like does this do the correct function , and such . 
UNKNOWN Is it is it actually a bookof names to digits , or is it like a few pages? 
UNKNOWN Um booklet . 
UNKNOWN Some pages. 
UNKNOWN I was just thinking , if we were to store this information , some type of mapping . 
UNKNOWN This person probably need to use this feature like once , you know , when you first buy the remote control , or whenever they buy a new television , so once every s Yeah , and it's Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Doesn't have to be used very often that's right , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But it's a but it's a nuisance . 
UNKNOWN And it's a nuisance very close to the to um to actually purchasing it , so it's something that you're likely to be thinking about . 
UNKNOWN If you if there's w i if there's one in the shop that's that says it can avoid much of that nuisance , you might be favourably inclined towards it . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Um mm . 
UNKNOWN Okay , this just to give us a rough idea of what we're meant to be doing for the next stage . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN I'm pretty sure that you got that anyway . 
UNKNOWN This is the conceptual one . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN I think we've come up I think we've covered everything we need to here . 
UNKNOWN Um I think we've decided on what , you know , decided on standard items for most of um rubber and such , so we're now looking at the detailed design and what we need to be doing for the next meeting . 
UNKNOWN Um So for example , um I'll just start at the top , you've got yourself and the Industrial Designer gonna be working quite closely at this stage 'cause it'll be hard not to , obviously . 
UNKNOWN Um looking from prototyping of some des description using clay . 
UNKNOWN Um I suppose you'll be told a lot more about that as uh progress . 
UNKNOWN Um The user interface design , They're kind of it looks they're the idea I've pushed forward so far is maybe more of a physical one there , whereas possibly be more interested in maybe how the L_C_D_'s going to incorporate , do you think ? 
UNKNOWN Or do you s perceive that most the design design decisions still need to be based on the physical layout? 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Um well I I think other than ge getting a sort of more aesthetically pleasing form for it , um mo most of the sort of layoutdesign decisions are are made , I would say . 
UNKNOWN Um but then again , the um the menu structure to to a considerable extent that's gonna vary according to the model of television , and also any customisations that the user might wish to incorporate . 
UNKNOWN So um and one of the nice things about having an L_C_D_ and a menu structure is that there is that flexibility to it . 
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm , that's very true . 
CONFUSION Um . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um got product evaluation as well . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , you see I don't some of these things kinda logically follow the others . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN How can t product evaluation , doesn't that come after actually seen a product prototype . 
UNKNOWN I I think we'd be yeah , no , it'd be more a case of how do we envisage us performing the product evaluation once we have a model to test with . 
UNKNOWN Oh , that's the okay , sure sure sure . 
UNKNOWN Um so it'd be a case of do you think that just bringing users in to have them test it out , uh maybe putting a certain number of products into the field in certain places which I suppose is quite similar . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Or just kind of hitting the streets and you know saying this is a new remote control , what do you think of the look of it ? 
UNKNOWN Okay , sure . 
UNKNOWN Um I think the target audience is pretty much anybody under the age of say maybe sixty or something ludicrous . 
UNKNOWN At this stage we still have no no target audience or 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN Um the reason I'm saying that is we're just looking at a a replacement remote control , something that's stylish , so maybe you're even just maybe you're narrowing down your target audience simply by saying if they're buying it that often or they're maybe looking to replace something then , they've got a bit of free cash , so that puts them potentially in the younger age bracket . 
UNKNOWN And it's stylish . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Maybe even single , just for the reasons of um uh excess cash flow . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Although of course I mean at twenty five Euros , I don't think we're looking at charging the earth for the uh device . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Think that's well within the normal bracket . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um your idea of the U_S_B_ would I think would largely depend on the cost . 
UNKNOWN U_S_B_'s definitely one of the cheapest interfaces out there , but it might push the cost of the overall unit up 'cause it would require not just the connection but the chip for communicating with the rest of the system . 
UNKNOWN That one might have to be based on The the idea was that maybe it could connect up for um allowing a software interface on the P_C_ for a larger programming due to the fact that we've gone for such a nice , easy minimal design , normally . 
UNKNOWN Programmable memory as well . 
UNKNOWN The U_S_B_ for which ? 
UNKNOWN For the remote control . 
UNKNOWN Oh right , okay . 
UNKNOWN We've w definitely talking some type of Different . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN But didn't they just say it's just for T_V_ , or are we gonna Okay , yeah . 
UNKNOWN It's just for T_V_ , but for programming it to use your T_V_ , you might hook it up to the P_C_ . 
UNKNOWN I I'm not sure , but I'm thinking maybe that the additional cost of the U_S_B_ might be prohibitive . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN We don't know unless it would make sense to . 
UNKNOWN But you're gonna need some type of flash memory or something . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I mean it's Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well something that doesn't you wouldn't have to redo the whole thing once the batteries are changed , you know , once you turn off the power . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN The other thing I mean it I mean it would need to ha it would need to have um some sort of on board memory anyway . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um f for one for one thing because I do think that the menu system should be um uh I mean although you know , it's not going to be terribly complicated if it's just controlling one device , the menu system ought to be um o ought to be customisable and uh Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Different languages , uh different skins and stuff like that . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN W It would make sense to . 
UNKNOWN How uh how uh how you want say the um the the menu structure for flicking through channels if you've got lots of channels . 
CONFIRMATION Sure . 
UNKNOWN I if it was customisable as in different languages and stuff , that does open it is supposed to be international , right ? 
UNKNOWN That sort of thing . 
UNKNOWN So . 
UNKNOWN It would make sense if you could Okay . 
UNKNOWN I would say to . 
UNKNOWN Um and we'd better be careful about the time as well . 
UNKNOWN We've already had the five minute warning , so . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN I would say yeah . 
UNKNOWN International would make sense . 
UNKNOWN Um you're gonna look at product evaluation . 
UNKNOWN I'm I'd better start writing up a hell of a lot of crap . 
UNKNOWN Um you're gonna look a bit more at the kind of the physical make up you say . 
UNKNOWN Um looks like we're gonna need a maybe a kind of prototype in clay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh we'll see how that goes . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Are we going to be supplied with the clay is what I want to know . 
UNKNOWN Where is the clay ? 
UNKNOWN So um do I think we've got an idea of where we need to go for the next meeting , would you say ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN they're going with the fashion thing , like the design , spongy rubber . 
UNKNOWN The fruit and veg . 
UNKNOWN This one . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I would s that would be my my feeling . 
UNKNOWN I th I think I would largely want to actually steer clear of the whole sort of fruit and veg thing . 
UNKNOWN Bu but um but the spongy idea I like . 
UNKNOWN I like it a lot . 
UNKNOWN We seem to have quite a general consensus that the idea of the the r rubber could be quite Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I having it i having it sort of br bright yellow I think that's quite a good idea , though maybe we could have options for colours as well . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN and again this has the advantage of being harder to lose . 
CONFIRMATION Sure . 
UNKNOWN I mean we are trying to promote a remote control , but we wanna keep the company brand as well , so . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So we always need to remember that somewhere we're meant to be getting the slogan on . 
UNKNOWN Possibly I'm think I'm not sure but I'm seeing a little bit of space around maybe the joystick area which could be used . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN I was like like I said before I I think we should have the R_R_ on the uh on the top function button . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN And I think that says it all really . 
UNKNOWN I think so too . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN See everybody in a half hour . 
UNKNOWN Sa Uh uh okay . 
UNKNOWN That should hopefully do the trick , um . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN Sorry about the small delay . 
UNKNOWN Falling a little bit behind schedule . 
UNKNOWN And that's uh fifteen twenty five . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So just to try and roughly go over what we agreed in the last one , um we're gonna go for something uh uh how was it ? 
UNKNOWN Uh The new black , I believe . 
UNKNOWN Um something that looks good 'cause that seems to be in preference to actual functionality in the end , though we should never avoid functionality , of course . 
UNKNOWN . 
UNKNOWN Uh many of our components are gonna be standard , off the shelf , but it seemed like we were gonna require at least an advanced chip and we were still very much for the idea of using an L_C_D_ display . 
UNKNOWN Um other things were we were hoping to use rubber , most likely gonna be double curved , etcetera . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So um due to your hard work , we might as well let the uh two designers go first , and uh show us the prototype . 
UNKNOWN Okay , it's a I think if we both step up and uh outline our ideas . 
UNKNOWN Quite how the best way to do this is , I'm not sure , but Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Now do uh doing the prototype gave us a bit more insight into the ergonomics of the design . 
UNKNOWN Um for one thing , it turned out that the only point at which it needs to be articulated for handedness is um is h i is down here for the uh L_E_D_ . 
UNKNOWN As it turned out , the whole thing transfers from the right to left hand fairly well from the point of view of operating the uh function buttons and joystick , though it might be an idea to be able to a adjust the positions for the base of the joystick just a little bit for uh ju just a thought . 
UNKNOWN You could simply have a slightly ovoid shaped joystick that could then just be turn uh twisted round , so that the uh sticky uh so that the bit that sticks out a bit more is on one side or the other . 
UNKNOWN But as you as you see with the uh with holding it in the left hand , the L_ uh the L_C_D_ is nowhere useful , so that would need to be articulated uh if we're going to retain ergonomic design . 
UNKNOWN Um now I I got your note about uh keeping the cost down . 
UNKNOWN I'm afraid yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN We'll go into that a bit more , but please go on . 
UNKNOWN this design could be done with um with uh plastic casing . 
UNKNOWN Though I would recommend around the grip part here in the middle , having maybe just a rubber grip over that which would allow for a slightly more sort of bio-morphic form , and a bit more ergonomic as well . 
UNKNOWN As for the um as for the single curve , um well this edge and this edge , like I say it would be nice to have some curvature to it , but it's not absolutely necessary . 
UNKNOWN Really the curve that's most needed is the underside so that the jo so that the joystick rests over the the edge of the hand like this . 
UNKNOWN Um and you have the uh transmitter here and a wee speaker for the uh for the uh for the uh fi uh for the remote control finder . 
UNKNOWN So . 
UNKNOWN Any further comments ? 
UNKNOWN Um obviously it's gonna be bulkier than how it looks , because it's gonna be flat on one side , so the L_C_D_ will be s sticking down like this , won't it ? 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause it you can't get it curved . 
UNKNOWN Uh because of costs . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I mean the uh Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And it's plastic as well , so it won't be as comfortable on the hand . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I mean with the with the rubber design it could i you know it could pretty much mould very much to the to the user's hand . 
UNKNOWN One nice wee feature if we could if we could still do the rubber , I though of was to have the uh rubber extend beyond the end of the uh of the rigid substructure . 
UNKNOWN So it has a wee sort of tail that you just drape over your wrist so it stays in position nicely . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Lovely . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , . 
CONFIRMATION Okay , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Great . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Yeah I've got a if you load up my evaluation document. 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Excellent work . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Uh evaluation . 
UNKNOWN Basic point uh have a list of criteria that we need to rate the prototype by . 
UNKNOWN Um then we will it's a seven s um seven seven step kinda evaluation process . 
UNKNOWN So um not seven steps , seven scale . 
UNKNOWN So after we've finished doing all the ratings for each criteria , we average that and that will give us some type of uh confidence in our prototype . 
UNKNOWN And uh the criteria based on Real Reactions' kinda goals and policies , marketing strategies , and also those I put together from the user requirements phase . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN Um if you flip the So , those are the criteria . 
UNKNOWN And uh perhaps I could have put 'em a bit better , but you notice a few things that we've totally abandoned , which means that uh the product will score very badly on some of those points . 
UNKNOWN Put it mildly . 
UNKNOWN So we have um true ? 
UNKNOWN One , t Seven , eight , oh . 
UNKNOWN Fourth . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so we have to go through each point . 
UNKNOWN If we imagine it's actually straight , and just give it a a score . 
UNKNOWN So um how well would you say the prototype is uh how well have we realised the dream of being able to stop remotes from from being lost , or to be able to find them once they are lost . 
UNKNOWN I mean , uh is the homing thing still the locator , is that still Sure . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's still part of the design . 
UNKNOWN And Adam , we can keep that in ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I believe so . 
UNKNOWN So I mean I don't think anybody could actually stop a remote being lost , 'cause that would mean doing something about the human element , but I'd like to think that we've done something about finding the damn thing once we have . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Sure . 
UNKNOWN T Sure . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN And making it a bright colour helps with the personally I would have gone for purple . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Bright colour . 
UNKNOWN So we still have that noise thing , yeah ? 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Os on a scale of one to seven , how would you guys rate it for finding finding it once it's lost ? 
UNKNOWN I'd say number one . 
UNKNOWN Number one ? 
UNKNOWN One . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Number number one for the first criteria . 
UNKNOWN I think w if it was just the sounder then th I mean something I've found with uh w w with say tr trying to find uh a cordless phone or a m mobile , you can hear it , but you can't quite pin it dow pin down where it is . 
UNKNOWN Yeah you can tell what room the mobile is Yeah . 
UNKNOWN What about what if the the volume on the T_V_'s turned up massively and uh you just wanna turn down the volume can't find remote . 
UNKNOWN Bu Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Suppose you have to go to the T_V_ and do it manually . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Like y you wouldn't hear the speaker . 
UNKNOWN Um just before we go through all of the steps here , um well what we'll do is um if we can look at the criteria you're gonna evaluate , and then we'll come back to the product evaluation if that's alright . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN You wanna say something ? 
CONFIRMATION That's fine . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , is that Um so is there anything here that you that you wanted to cover as in the criteria that you've covered ? 
UNKNOWN Oh that's that's fine . 
UNKNOWN And then we'll come back pretty much promptly to this . 
UNKNOWN What do you mean cr is there anything I wanna Um , a few . 
UNKNOWN I is there any of these criteria that need any explaining ? 
UNKNOWN Or is there anything that yous thought tha really would stand out compared to the others ? 
UNKNOWN Something I neglected from my initial research is that Real Reactions has a a goal strategy that all of the products be inspired by material fashion , and clothing fashion . 
UNKNOWN That is why fruit and veg being popular in the home and in clothing was important and they want all their products to be somehow inspired by current trends in fashion . 
UNKNOWN So they say we put the fashion in electronics , well they really mean it they they're very big on fashion , so . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN That's this bit right here . 
UNKNOWN And uh this bit is this one easy to use for visitors or for anybody ? 
UNKNOWN I guess it's just the same as saying easy to use interface , so it's kinda condensed into one . 
UNKNOWN And we can come back to it , you said . 
UNKNOWN So . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN No and which we will do very very shortly . 
CONFUSION Um . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Slight problem we had was that we have an amazing four Euros over budget for what we were hoping to do . 
UNKNOWN Um most of it stems from the use of the L_C_D_ which I think in the end accounted for about half of our expenditure because of course we required a chip as well . 
UNKNOWN Um the only way to get this down was either to ditch the a L_C_D_ , at which point we've removed a large part of how we were gonna interface , require more buttons , etcetera . 
UNKNOWN Or what we did was that we um we as in I as I was quickly going over it was altering the actual structure . 
UNKNOWN Um changing it to plastic and a solid unit with a single curve design would allow us to come back into the um proposed costs and we're just scraping it in , we've got point two of a Euro left over there . 
UNKNOWN So we're just managing it really . 
UNKNOWN Even then as well , um there was no criteria technically defined for a joystick so I've used what I think's appropriate . 
UNKNOWN With any luck that won't mean that we've incurred more cost than we can actually afford to . 
UNKNOWN It blows a lot of our really good ideas kind of slightly to one side , for example the possibility of having a U_S_B_ connection is definitely not viable now . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Different languages ? 
UNKNOWN That should still be viable . 
UNKNOWN We've got an advanced chip , we've got the use of the L_C_D_ . 
UNKNOWN So being able to communicate in multiple languages is still very much a possibility . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um but what's something we need to decide on is how we're gonna go from here . 
UNKNOWN We do need to try and come up with an idea which could be continued with other people if need be . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN We can I can bring the excel up sheetup and uh show you if you wish um . 
UNKNOWN I really think as m much as it pains me is that we might have to go with plastic and some kind of solid design , possibly meaning that the L_C_D_ wouldn't be in this perfect place . 
UNKNOWN It might be s stuck like slightly between what would be good for left handed and what would be good for a right handed person . 
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm I suppose o one thing that could be done is h is have it um circular and have it s so that the uh the pink actually goes a bit over the pinkie finger . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN So that uh th Mm . 
UNKNOWN It very much is about making concessions , unfortunately . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Do you have any data on how much um different prints cost ? 
UNKNOWN I mean can you get the entire thing printed with a design um ? 
UNKNOWN Um b b b da is you mean on the plastic , or ? 
UNKNOWN . 
UNKNOWN Let's have a look . 
UNKNOWN You now have as much information as I do . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN So as you can see here , for example , the battery really not very little choice in that one . 
UNKNOWN We've gone for one of the cheaper options as well . 
UNKNOWN Unfortunately we require the advanced chip if we're gonna do what we're needing to . 
UNKNOWN I've said single curved . 
UNKNOWN We really do need it to be that way for the ergonomics of it . 
UNKNOWN Um plastic for some reason incurs no cost , which I've had to very much make advantage of , despite the fact that rubber's only got a value of two Euros per unit . 
UNKNOWN Problem comes here as you can see in the interface . 
UNKNOWN Um if I've read this thing correctly , then we can save point five of a Euro here in that it's not per push button . 
UNKNOWN That might make sense , because then a numeric keypad would come in at um what , four point five Euros , which is an awful lot , so that could well be wrong . 
UNKNOWN Even if we save point five there , it would just mean that we're most likely placing it in actually just gaining a colour for the unit , which has had to be put to one side . 
UNKNOWN As you can see , the use of an L_C_ display um advanced chip and what would determine the scroll wheel here as well because it's an integrated scroll scroll wheel push button that wasn't quite what I think they had in mind with a joystick . 
UNKNOWN Why would why would that be more expensive than an individual push button and scroll wheel together ? 
UNKNOWN That's quite significantly expensive . 
UNKNOWN I that's something you'll have to take up with the bean counters . 
UNKNOWN . 
UNKNOWN Um as you can see I mean that's taken up well over half of the price . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So um I'm very much open to suggestions of where we go , but because we need to shed what was four Euros off of the um the price of for what we really desired , this one comes in under price as you can see , but this was the one that sacrificed the material for the case and for the actual case design . 
UNKNOWN We don't even have uh speakers here . 
UNKNOWN The like uh we uh what about speakers and transmitters and stuff like that ? 
UNKNOWN Have we factored that in ? 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Uh no , we haven't , not That'll it literally would just be a button . 
UNKNOWN Transmitter , receiver , speakers . 
UNKNOWN Plus the extra device itself that's gonna be on a T_V_ . 
UNKNOWN Is that gonna be a button , or Yeah . 
UNKNOWN That's too expensive isn't it ? 
UNKNOWN We might have to It looks like almost nothing Mm . 
UNKNOWN Oh good call , I missed that . 
UNKNOWN I I mean it's not on here , but um . 
UNKNOWN that's a very valid point . 
UNKNOWN Did they s do we have to use an advanced chip for the L_C_D_ ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Well that's yeah . 
UNKNOWN So if we're gonna go with the L_C_ display , then that's I believe so , yeah . 
UNKNOWN What's a hand dyna dynamo ? 
UNKNOWN You have to wind it up ? 
UNKNOWN That would probably not be in keeping with the um the fashion statement and such , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Technology . 
UNKNOWN Fashion . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So basically the only new thing is the L_C_D_ on the remote now . 
UNKNOWN Being manipulated by the joystick , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Oh , and joystick , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Which I'm defining as scroll wheel . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN And we couldn't replace the joystick , right ? 
UNKNOWN Because we would need four extra buttons to replace it , up down left and right , and that would be more expensive than a but is a scroll wheel not just back and forward ? 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah it's just because there was no actual definition for what a joystick might be , that that's what I've labelled it for the purposes of this evaluation . 
UNKNOWN So The L_C_D_ basically is the big selling point of the remote . 
UNKNOWN If we remove the L_C_ display , we could save ourselves a fair amount . 
UNKNOWN Which you could It's a shame . 
UNKNOWN But that's what makes it uh original though , isn't it ? 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think if we remove the the L_C_ display then there was absolutely no point to any of these meetings and we just we could just put our branding on any other remote control . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Uh k Does this does this bear in mind that I mean it's a bit ridiculous that they're gonna charge us what is it , like this much money for three million if we're gonna buy three million components , you know . 
UNKNOWN We should possibly have If we could've increased the price we could've manufactured that and we could've got something far closer to what we were hoping to . 
UNKNOWN Again , you'll have to argue with the accountants on that one . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Um but for the purposes of this meeting , I'm we're gonna have to stick with these figures . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN So , I would say that it would seem like the general opinion is we're gonna keep the L_C_ display 'cause it's about what really separates us , despite the cost it's gonna incur . 
UNKNOWN I think so . 
UNKNOWN Um are people maybe not happy with , but are willing to go ahead with this in going for a plastic solid case , to keep the L_C_D_ ? 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um yeah I mean one thing , I mean ho uh how much extra would it be to to keep I mean keep the um the articulation ? 
UNKNOWN It's hard to tell . 
UNKNOWN Um I would say that you're at least gonna take double curved , and even then I'm not quite sure if that's incorporating the idea of articulation . 
UNKNOWN This is what I'm wondering . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Oh no , I think I I it d that it needn't require it to be double curved . 
UNKNOWN It can be s yeah , it can still be single curved , but You just . 
UNKNOWN It's uh it's just it's just it's just that the case would come in t would be made in two parts and then joined together with an articulation . 
UNKNOWN Single curved with articulation ? 
UNKNOWN Could we could we not get rid of the curvy the curvous the curvaceousness and focus on the menu being the best interface ? 
UNKNOWN 'Cause like we do we have re restrictions on software ? 
UNKNOWN That's what we need for the joystick I think though . 
UNKNOWN Oh but there has to be joystick . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I mean and I mean the uh I mean if you look uh if you look closer at the uh at the prototype here , the lines here along the grip are actually quite straight . 
UNKNOWN Um I mean yeah , on the on the L_C_D_ I mean although we've done it with a curve it could just as easily be done um without curves . 
UNKNOWN But the curves all o over hand , is it ? 
UNKNOWN The curve that's really needed is up here , to put uh to keep the joystick in a good ergonomic position for it to have it rest on the top of the hand . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Sure . 
UNKNOWN Okay , my bad . 
UNKNOWN We wouldn't actually save a lot by reducing it anyway , so I mean for the purposes of this meeting maybe we can state that single curve still allows articulation . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Um unless we hear otherwise we could go ahead with that proposal . 
UNKNOWN So I think the product is not gonna perform so well for my criteria . 
UNKNOWN Which is what we can get onto now . 
UNKNOWN As long as so are we gonna say w we have to keep an eye on the time as well , but we're gonna say um single curved design It could well be , but at a cost of Okay , yeah we'll definitely won't go with that one . 
UNKNOWN Oh , wait a minute. 
UNKNOWN Sample speaker ? 
UNKNOWN What is a sample speaker ? 
UNKNOWN Is that somewhat similar to what we want ? 
UNKNOWN Mm no that's that voice response thing that we got the emailabout . 
UNKNOWN Costs four . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But I thought it was just completely pointless . 
UNKNOWN You got a emailabout voice response ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I did not , so . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
UNKNOWN B i basically it was saying that our labs had come up with a chip that you could , you know , say hello to , and it would say hello back in a friendly female voice . 
UNKNOWN We won't go with that one , did you say ? 
UNKNOWN I mean I we Okay , okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's voice recognition , so . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN So , okay yeah , battery definitely , It looks like it unless we can manage to put it in under point two Euros , um . 
UNKNOWN So it looks like we're gonna get rid of the whole loca locator thing . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Maybe even slight well oh yeah , pretty much point two Euros , I'd say . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So we'll leave that one for now . 
UNKNOWN we'll just have It's uh a case of um I'm uh slightly unsure . 
UNKNOWN Are we going for a special colour at all ? 
UNKNOWN One point five of a Euro for one push button doesn't sound quite right . 
UNKNOWN So maybe it's a case of a push button is maybe one or more . 
CONFUSION Um . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Well I was for a case . 
UNKNOWN At which point if Well you got point five there . 
UNKNOWN Or had you already incorporated that ? 
UNKNOWN Oh , special colour for the case . 
UNKNOWN It's literally a case of whether or not this is correct . 
UNKNOWN I'm not quite sure if they're I don't think they mean point five Euros per button . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Okay , well l let's say that and then we can have our special coloured case and then we at least have make it a little harder to lose . 
UNKNOWN So There we go . 
UNKNOWN Because most m most remotes are a fairly dingy colour that gets camouflaged under any pile of crap in a living room . 
UNKNOWN W what's the default colour ? 
UNKNOWN White or black ? 
UNKNOWN Black's probably the normal colour you'd say , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Or grey . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN I quite like that colour that you're fetching there , it's uh definitely for make it glow in the dark even better . 
UNKNOWN Yellow . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So will we go with that then ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It's not and we can see we'll come back to uh your evaluation which you're probably now going to pan us but there we go . 
CONFIRMATION Sure . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So uh Right okay . 
UNKNOWN Just to give you an idea , um you want to go maybe a bit quickly as well , I'm not sure how much time . 
UNKNOWN We've not hit the five minute mark warning yet , but . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Think it's ten minutes left . 
UNKNOWN Ten . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN Ability to stop remotes from being lost or to find them once they are lost . 
CONFUSION Um . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Special colour . 
UNKNOWN Special colour . 
UNKNOWN Mm mm four ? 
UNKNOWN Uh uh four . 
UNKNOWN Three ? 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Three if we're being generous , I feel . 
UNKNOWN Three . 
UNKNOWN I think we can do three . 
UNKNOWN Three . 
UNKNOWN Think we're being generous here with three . 
UNKNOWN Th the special colour doesn't would I think make a difference . 
UNKNOWN It makes it stand out from you know it's lost in a big pile of crap , it stands out from the rest of the crap . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Reduce the number of unused buttons . 
UNKNOWN We're down to t two buttons , is it ? 
UNKNOWN Two buttons . 
UNKNOWN Two buttons and a joystick . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so that's a one . 
UNKNOWN You know , where that's Okay , that was good . 
UNKNOWN Totally . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I'd say we're doing well there . 
UNKNOWN Easy to use interface , buttons menu , menus that's yeah that's good . 
UNKNOWN 'Kay that's we're not doing so badly . 
UNKNOWN Um easy to use oh okay , let's forget that one . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Fancy looking . 
UNKNOWN As he models the I'd Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It doesn't get much fancier . 
CONFIRMATION Sure . 
UNKNOWN And we could do whatever we like with the L_ L_C_D_ . 
UNKNOWN Yeah let's just assume it's a good L_C_D_ display . 
UNKNOWN Maybe I was panicking for no reason . 
UNKNOWN Are we going one on ? 
UNKNOWN I'd say we go two , 'cause like f the fanciest would be the double curved . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , w maybe you'd be a bit too yeah . 
UNKNOWN Wouldn't it ? 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN With the articulators . 
UNKNOWN There we go . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's m that's that's better too . 
UNKNOWN With bells on it . 
UNKNOWN More accurate numbers . 
UNKNOWN Technologically innovative . 
UNKNOWN Well , we're getting rid of the locator thing which which yeah . 
UNKNOWN Which is a shame . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN I'd give it a three for this for that . 
UNKNOWN No need for teletext . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I mean the menus thing is something you don't normally see on um on a remote , but you see it in a lot of other places . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , mobile phones . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN And y what you're doing is moving the menu from the television to the remote control , so it's You say three ? 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN I might go as far as two on that . 
UNKNOWN Three . 
UNKNOWN I'd give it a three . 
UNKNOWN I'd be tempted with three , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Three . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN We'll get panned on the next one , anyway . 
UNKNOWN Materials that people find pleasing . 
UNKNOWN Sponginess is what they really would have wanted , apparently . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , w It is , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Don't blame them . 
UNKNOWN Um because of the way that we've minimalised the number of buttons and such . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Plastic , it sucks . 
UNKNOWN But it's no worse than any of the other pl remote controls we have . 
UNKNOWN That's true . 
UNKNOWN It's not a step backwards . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN five ? 
UNKNOWN Six ? 
UNKNOWN I'd s I I'd give it a six , to be honest . 
UNKNOWN Six , . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , okay let's give it a six . 
UNKNOWN Okay , that's totally thrown everything off balance . 
UNKNOWN Inspired by the latest interior and clothing fashion . 
UNKNOWN W we could . 
UNKNOWN What colour were we gonna make it ? 
UNKNOWN Put a leopard printon it . 
UNKNOWN Well I I I would sa I would say give a s give a selection of colours . 
UNKNOWN Um we went with yellow we went with yellow for the prototype 'cause we had yellow . 
UNKNOWN I know , but But um by this I think it's more a case of fruit and veg , Yeah . 
UNKNOWN If I were buying one , I'd go for purple . 
UNKNOWN Leopard printwould be cool . 
UNKNOWN Yeah we gotta . 
UNKNOWN I'd say the colour of the border there world you'd find that , that's that'd stand out . 
UNKNOWN Like yellow , yeah . 
UNKNOWN It would also help keep the the product placement s yeah . 
UNKNOWN Logo , brand . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Mm 'kay . 
UNKNOWN But Th th they're referring to the fruit and veg thing . 
UNKNOWN Is it inspired by clothing fashion ? 
UNKNOWN Is this like a banana type colour ? 
UNKNOWN Could we stretch no still , it's not shaped like a banana is Oh is that 'cause it's flat ? 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN It's kind o it probably Well I mean it's probably more fruit and veg than most other things out there bar fruit and veg , so , what , four ? 
UNKNOWN That's kinda i it won't be when it's been budgeted . 
UNKNOWN What is what fruit or veg is flat ? 
UNKNOWN I I think s I I think this isn't not particularly fruit and veggie . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Or we might have to suffer badly for this one as well . 
UNKNOWN Yellow courgette . 
UNKNOWN Four ? 
UNKNOWN Oh that's it's very ambitious , yeah , um . 
UNKNOWN Is that being too generous ? 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN I'd I'd I don't think fruit and veg is the sole criterion . 
UNKNOWN Oh dear , . 
CONFIRMATION Sure . 
UNKNOWN Is the sole criterion for being um fashion fashionable or inspired by current fashions . 
UNKNOWN Inspired by . 
UNKNOWN Um I'd g I'd rate I'd rate this fairly highly from that point of view actually . 
UNKNOWN Well this this what we're gonna t this is their motto , like . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And we're we're not doing well on it . 
UNKNOWN This is their strategy . 
UNKNOWN I m imagine we actually had some money invested in this and the amount that we invest is gonna be proportional to the marks . 
UNKNOWN Might we might wanna be a bit more skepible sceptical about this one . 
UNKNOWN What would you think yourself ? 
UNKNOWN I would say I mean it's it's not at all , right ? 
UNKNOWN In any way or shape or form . 
UNKNOWN We didn't m Okay , the the yellow banana like thing is I think is okay . 
UNKNOWN Well , it's kind of curved and we can make it yellow , and that's pretty much banana like . 
UNKNOWN Si it's got a curve to it . 
UNKNOWN Right five . 
UNKNOWN Is that sound reasonable ? 
UNKNOWN Am I do you think I'm stretching the uh the use of the banana ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I'll go with five . 
UNKNOWN Five . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN 'Kay , so we have one , two , three , four , five , six , seven . 
UNKNOWN So five , seven , ten , sixteen , twenty one . 
UNKNOWN Which gives us an average of three . 
UNKNOWN It's well this would be in the middle . 
UNKNOWN So we it's it's not bad . 
UNKNOWN It's in the good section . 
UNKNOWN It's not bad and considering the don't pick the pen . 
UNKNOWN Oops . 
UNKNOWN Sorry . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN I'm I'm sorry . 
UNKNOWN Y oh and you've knocked batteries out . 
UNKNOWN Um right okay it's considering the price we had to get this in , to have a positive you know , even based on the four of us being heavily biased , um it was gonna be quite hard to get anything standing out I'd say possibly , based on um the the cost features . 
UNKNOWN 'S bad design , that thing . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Mm , yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Even if we were to increase this entire thing by by seven , we were to go down a grade to to four , we would have to do I mean we didn't we weren't that kinda optimistic too optim overly optimistic . 
UNKNOWN You know like we didn't we didn't add we didn't subtract a whole seven points from these things , so I think we're definitely on the good bit . 
UNKNOWN Even if we gave this one seven and this one seven , that's still only three extra points over seven . 
UNKNOWN You know , it's yeah , we did it w it was okay . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN It was good . 
UNKNOWN Personally , I think given that the product um only replaces a single remote control that you've already got , are people really gonna shell out twenty five Euros for something that's only marginally good ? 
UNKNOWN Well , it depends who your who's what the target people are , like you'd say maybe the fashion conscious women would be going , oh look at that , 's cool , it looks like a it's yellow , looks like a banana , it's cool it's gotta look good in the sitting room . 
UNKNOWN Maybe it's been targeted Hide it in the fruit basket . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Rather than the L_C_D_ whereas uh more technical like like more uh people in with the latest technology it's good , it's got an L_C_D_ screen 's only got two buttons and a joystick . 
UNKNOWN So , which which kind of people would be more likely to buy it ? 
UNKNOWN Probably the people technologically . 
UNKNOWN They're usually the ones that buy pointless stuff . 
UNKNOWN I think so . 
UNKNOWN I mean my mum still has not learnt how to use text messaging on her phone , and she's had it for a long time , you know . 
UNKNOWN She uses it to make phone calls and that's it . 
UNKNOWN . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So I think if sh if my mum saw a remote control like this with only two buttons and a joystick , I mean that'll probably be the first one she decides not to buy , you know . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN She'd be like is this a remote control , I don't how do you use it , and stuff like that . 
UNKNOWN So even if it is really user friendly to us , but we're used to using menus all the time . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN I s I suppose one thing is that b because it's technically innovative , um for someone who's sort of technophobic , the fact that it simply looks unfamiliar would be daunting . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think it's totally uh radical to have a remote control with no no numbered buttons , yeah . 
CONFUSION Um . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But like radical good , maybe . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um don't know how lo much longer we've got . 
UNKNOWN At least five minutes I think . 
UNKNOWN Um quickly we'll pop onto project evaluation . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN So , we've got these uh four criteria here for uh satisfaction . 
UNKNOWN Does anybody want to um um do you have any opinions on any of them ? 
UNKNOWN For example um we'll work backwards I suppose . 
UNKNOWN The ability to work on this project using the technology we've been presented with . 
UNKNOWN Um people made good use of the uh pen and paper? 
UNKNOWN I would say I'm not quite sure what the advantage for us using a digital pen might be . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , got notesand doodles . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Wrote nearly a page, but not . 
UNKNOWN I think tracking . 
UNKNOWN Well I think this is a I think the digital pen's mostly for the benefit of the uh of the researchers studying this . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN It's all p goes into their corpus . 
UNKNOWN It must It does seem like the paper's still a heavy consideration for taking notes. 
UNKNOWN Though it would have been nice to be able to transfer the um transfer our n our papernotesonto the uh computer ourselves . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that woulda been pretty good . 
UNKNOWN So maybe this is literally just a way around it . 
CONFUSION Um I dunno . 
UNKNOWN How are people satisfied with the teamwork we've managed to display today ? 
UNKNOWN Good . 
UNKNOWN I'd yeah I liked it , yeah . 
UNKNOWN . 
UNKNOWN Leadership . 
UNKNOWN As much as can be leadered in this uh thing . 
CONFIRMATION Very good . 
UNKNOWN I li yeah , top marks . 
UNKNOWN Um last one we've got is room for creativity . 
UNKNOWN Well yeah . 
UNKNOWN Now , I think we got Yeah I think of in the end , ideas that can be used sadly . 
UNKNOWN Unti uh uh until uh until accounts came along , squish . 
UNKNOWN We're burs bursting with creativity . 
UNKNOWN We we're not lacking in ideas , you know it's that was not the problem . 
UNKNOWN Not so much that we weren't full of ideas , but of ones that are gonna allow us to actually build the thing . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN It's a bit of a pity . 
UNKNOWN Um I would have to agree on that . 
UNKNOWN I think we needed a larger budget . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN If you're going to aim your a um product maybe at the technological kind of sector , then you can afford to maybe jack the price up slightly from what it is . 
UNKNOWN Because they will pay outrageous cash to first on the market . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN I mean I th I mean I think to r retaining the s the more sort of bio-morphic form in the articulation would gain more in s uh would gain more profit in sales than it would lose in uh in added expense . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN And the price was like it was twice the w assembly cost . 
UNKNOWN And would it have to be twice that ? 
UNKNOWN It could be like coulda had the assembly like maybe fifteen Euro . 
UNKNOWN It could even That's true , yeah . 
UNKNOWN We'll still settle for twenty five . 
CONFUSION Maybe . 
UNKNOWN Um I suppose these are all that will have to be taken up with a at a different group at I guess . 
UNKNOWN As to a the costs involved . 
UNKNOWN But I mean we've got a a prototype . 
UNKNOWN Such as it is . 
UNKNOWN So I dunno , I I think it's gone okay today , considering the information that we've had at our disposal , and um such . 
UNKNOWN Maybe the counts wou woulda been better if we had a list or more Yeah , to begin with . 
UNKNOWN In the beginning , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Probably would have mean we could have come up with a lot more solid design in the end , I would have to agree . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It is very much a pity to um get so far into the stage and then find out that maybe some of your ideas are just a bit too expensive . 
UNKNOWN Always hard to tell until you know the costs . 
CONFUSION Um . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Are the costs within budget ? 
UNKNOWN Well , they are now that we have our slightly less than capable product . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN We've evaluated it , and we can say that we came out with a value of three . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Actually I want th one thing I would say I mean something that could perhaps be part of the product mm the um m product testing market research process would be to uh produce mock-ups of both versions and see just how much of a difference the over going over-budget um m would make to sales . 
UNKNOWN It's yeah ? 
UNKNOWN And like response from consumers . 
UNKNOWN And we could even you know , market two versions . 
UNKNOWN Wee cheapie version with the nice bio-morphic rubber . 
UNKNOWN And then the final one where you get to call it Hal . 
UNKNOWN But we'll go into that later . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
CONFIRMATION Sure . 
UNKNOWN Right um is there anything else that anybody would like to to add , um anything they think that's not been covered , before I quickly write up a final report. 
UNKNOWN Um I dunno , I mean we've got a product . 
UNKNOWN We maybe aren't as happy with it as we'd like to be , but we've got something we think we can maybe stick onto the the market and sell . 
UNKNOWN And of course something we have been avoiding talking about 'cause of we've no information is selling them directly to the manufacturers . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN There is a huge market . 
UNKNOWN I mean we've briefly touched on it but we've no more knowledge then there's little we can say on that . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So um unless anybody's got anything they'd like to add , we can maybe round this up slightly earlier than we'd need to and then we can finish up the writing and such . 
UNKNOWN And I can get my bus . 
UNKNOWN Yeah ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay , let's Thank you . 
UNKNOWN Uh thank you for your participation . 
THANKS Thank you . 
UNKNOWN I was actually kind of upset you know at the budget , and that we had to cut a lot of stuff . 
UNKNOWN It's like man , we we can't have the locator thing . 
UNKNOWN And s yeah that's just bad . 
UNKNOWN Do you think maybe the prices were were made ? 
UNKNOWN That a question we can ask . 
UNKNOWN Hmm hmm hmm . 
UNKNOWN Are we we're not allowed to dim the lights so people can see that a bit better ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay , that's fine . 
UNKNOWN Am I supposed to be standing up there ? 
UNKNOWN So we've got both of these clipped on ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN She gonna answer me or not ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I've got Yes . 
UNKNOWN Right , both of them , okay . 
SURPRISE God .
UNKNOWN Jesus , it's gonna fall off . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yep , yep . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Tu tu tu tu Hi , good morning . 
GREETING Hello everybody . 
UNKNOWN Um I'm Sarah , the Project Manager and this is our first meeting , surprisingly enough . 
UNKNOWN Okay , this is our agenda, um we will do some stuff , get to know each other a bit better to feel more comfortable with each other . 
UNKNOWN Um then we'll go do tool training , talk about the project plan , discuss our own ideas and everything um and we've got twenty five minutes to do that , as far as I can understand . 
UNKNOWN Now , we're developing a remote control which you probably already know . 
UNKNOWN Um , we want it to be original , something that's uh people haven't thought of , that's not out in the shops , um , trendy , appealing to a wide market , but you know , not a hunk of metal , and user-friendly , grannies to kids , maybe even pooches should be able to use it . 
UNKNOWN Okay , um , first is the functional design , um this is where we all go off and do our individual work , um what needs need to be fulfilled by the product , um what effects the product has to have and how it's actually going to do that . 
UNKNOWN Um , conceptual design , what we're thinking , how it's gonna go and then the detailed design , how we're actually gonna put it into practice and make it work . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN Okay , right . 
UNKNOWN We're gonna practice with the pens and drawour favourite animal on the white board , I'll go first , and um sum up the characteristics of that animal . 
UNKNOWN So Okay , I'll leave space for everyone else . 
UNKNOWN Oops . 
UNKNOWN Um What's missing ? 
UNKNOWN We're running out of blue . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN I'm not gonna ask you to guess , I'm going to tell you that's supposed to be a tiger . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN And I see them as majestic , and independent , and proud . 
UNKNOWN Oh sorry . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Now , who would like to go next ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , me . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN Cat . 
UNKNOWN Where did this come from ? 
UNKNOWN Is that your lapel then ? 
UNKNOWN Uh , yep . 
UNKNOWN There you go . 
THANKS Thank you . 
UNKNOWN Uh , maybe you can guess what I'm trying to make ? 
UNKNOWN A kind of dog ? 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN It's actually sitting , so it's sitting , it's not standing . 
CONFUSION Sorry ? 
UNKNOWN It's sitting down . 
CONFUSION Uh . 
UNKNOWN Okay , I see it as one thing it's very supportive . 
UNKNOWN It's your best friend and your you can talk to a dog , it can be your best friend , it doesn't discriminate between you , based on what you are . 
UNKNOWN Second it's loyal and third thing it's got intuition . 
UNKNOWN dogs can som sometimes can make out between a thief and a person so basically these are the three unique features I think belong to a dog . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay , thank you . 
THANKS Thank you . 
UNKNOWN Yeah I'll have a go . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Sorry . 
UNKNOWN Please , please leave me a space at the bottom , I'm little , you can get to the top , with standing on a chair . 
CONFIRMATION Thanks . 
UNKNOWN Alright , okay . 
UNKNOWN Well since you guys have chosen the ones I wanted to do , I'll have to have to go for something a bit random . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Does it look like a dog actually ? 
UNKNOWN And also , my drawingskill isn't that great so , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well , as you can see , the quality of the work today is um Gonna be a bird . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN I think it's outstandingly good . 
UNKNOWN Okay , now I'm gonna have to change what is was originally gonna be because that looks like a beak now , so . 
UNKNOWN Crocodile ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , it can be a crocodile , it can be a crocodile . 
UNKNOWN Is it gonna be it's gonna be a bird . 
UNKNOWN Well it was it was an at first firstly it was an attempt at a T_ Rex and then it sort of changed into a pelican but it can be a crocodile now actually . 
UNKNOWN O Beauti that's Okay . 
UNKNOWN That's lovely . 
UNKNOWN Yeah and uh I'll have to think on the spot of uh things that it is . 
UNKNOWN Um uh scary , uh strong , yeah that's about it I think . 
UNKNOWN Okay it's fine . 
UNKNOWN Um , I'm very impressed with your artistic skills , mine's are dreadful . 
UNKNOWN Uh uh Wo Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Oops this is now coming apart , let me just put the top in . 
UNKNOWN I hope that clicks in , I'll just I'll hold it on , okay . 
UNKNOWN Oops , oh dear , what happened there ? 
UNKNOWN Technical help . 
UNKNOWN Hopefully that'll stay on , two-handed version . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Okay , uh Again this is off the top of my head , I was gonna do a big cat too , um . 
UNKNOWN Uh S Uh Okay , some sort of bird . 
UNKNOWN Oh dear , it doesn't look what like what I want it to be . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
CONFUSION Uh . 
UNKNOWN It's not a vampire bat honestly . 
CONFIRMATION Okay , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh and somewhere there's a body behind . 
UNKNOWN That's my dreadful that's the worst yet , that's it's meant to be an eagle you can tell it's a flying animal could have been a seagull , I never thought of a seagull . 
UNKNOWN A seagu right , not a seagull . 
UNKNOWN Ah eagle , right okay . 
UNKNOWN Eagle , okay . 
UNKNOWN An eagle , um again I'm thinking on my feet goodness . 
UNKNOWN I suppose they're all so independent , I'd put that one down again . 
UNKNOWN Da dum um . 
UNKNOWN They're good at golf . 
UNKNOWN Indepen independent , right , did you say they're good at golf ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , no yeah , an eagle . 
UNKNOWN Are they ? 
UNKNOWN Eagle . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN Oh right , okay , I'm not good at golf . 
UNKNOWN I'd say they're quite free-spirited , flying around everywhere , doing their own thing . 
UNKNOWN And uh , birds of prey aren't they , oh dear , intrepid . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN I'll put that , intrepid . 
UNKNOWN There we go , hope that pen's gonna be okay . 
UNKNOWN That's lovely . 
UNKNOWN Whoops . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN That was fun , right . 
UNKNOWN Um finance-wise , we've got a selling price at twenty five Euros , which I don't actually know what that is in Pounds , at all . 
UNKNOWN Any ideas ? 
UNKNOWN It's about mm , mm yeah . 
UNKNOWN Seventeen . 
UNKNOWN One point four or something like that . 
UNKNOWN One point four Euro would make a Pound or something like that . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah , something like that , so that yeah about seventeen , seventeen Pounds , something like that . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN D fifteen ? 
UNKNOWN Seventeen Pounds . 
UNKNOWN Seventeen . 
UNKNOWN Okay , that's expensive . 
UNKNOWN Should we be making notesof this ? 
UNKNOWN We can just refer to this later can't we ? 
UNKNOWN But Havi having said that though , if you wanna get one of those the the ones on the market at the moment they're s they're about twenty pounds anyway . 
UNKNOWN I think so , I think so , I'll be able to um pull it up , or I could put it in the shared folder or something . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So , it'd still be yeah , we had to buy one . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Really ? 
UNKNOWN So so I suppose later it depends if we want to undercut the price , we d or or is it going to make our product look a cheapie-cheapie option ? 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN I think Yeah , um production cost's at twelve fifty , so half of the selling price is taken up by building it . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Okay , pretty huge margin . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um , and profit aim is fifty million Euros , which is uh Yi yes , um yeah , I presume so . 
UNKNOWN In our first year ? 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So then Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN You've got market range international and you did say earlier it's got to be a um accessible and usable by sort of all age groups just t we're not focusing on business market , any particular thing , it's everyone user-friendly to everyone . 
UNKNOWN No , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Big target group . 
UNKNOWN So yes , yes , I don't think we have to I don't think it's a case of worrying about different languages and things like that , um making that a key point , just that it's going to be in the international market like Australia , America , things like that . 
NEGATION No . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN What are your experiences with remote controls ? 
UNKNOWN I mean I've got we got um we had three videos , a T_V_ and a sort of amp thing all set up so we got one of the universal remote controls , um that you programme each of your things into , but that kept losing the signals so we'd have to re-programme it every now and again . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that c Okay , you wanna integrate everything into one like Okay . 
UNKNOWN I think it was quite a cheapie as well , so that might have had something to do with it , but that was quite good , the fact that you could You didn't have six remote controls sitting in front of you . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah uh . 
UNKNOWN Use all the ones at the same time . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Yeah , 'cause you Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN My experience has only been being given the remote control with the object I buy , not doing any tampering with it and programming , using it to programme T_V_ and uh uh videos and things . 
UNKNOWN But basically on , off , volume up and down , channel one , two , th that basic functions , I don't think I could go any further with it than that , so , I suppose it's got to be something usable by someone like me as well . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , the main that's the main stuff anyway , I mean and you don't want to I hate I hate looking at a control and seeing a million tiny little buttons with tiny little words saying what they all do and just sitting there searching for the teletext button or something like that . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN And symbols that you don't necessarily understand , symbols you're meant to understand that you don't . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So simplification of symbols you could think of . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN When they're when you've got the main things on the front of it and a section opens up or something to the other functions where you can do sound or options kind of recording , things like that inside it . 
UNKNOWN Oh yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause it doesn't make when you pick it up it doesn't make it really complicated to look at , it's obvious what you're doing , um . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Actually that just raises a point , I wonder what our design people think , but you know on a mobile phone , you can press a key and it gives you a menu , it's got a menu display , I wonder if incorporating that into the design of a remote control might be useful , so you've got a little L_C_D_ display . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Menu , alright . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh uh Right , I was thinking on the same lines you , instead of having too many b buttons and make it complicated for the user , may h maybe have an L_C_D_ di display or something like that , like a mobile , yeah and with menus . 
UNKNOWN With menus , yeah , yeah . 
UNKNOWN And if it's s somewhat similar to what you have on mobile phone , people might find it easier to browse and navigate also maybe . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN What about the older generation ? 
UNKNOWN What about granny and grandads ? 
UNKNOWN Um , my grandad can answer his mobile phone , but he couldn't even dream of texting or something like that . 
UNKNOWN You mean to save it lesser number . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Can he programme his remote control or is it basic with that too ? 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN I don't think they tape things , I don't think they use Mm , yeah , the age gap . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , my grandad's actually better than me at using teletext , so . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN So that's a problem regardless of of any design modifications you you come up with , that's gonna be a problem anyway with the older generation perhaps , and that's another issue how we tackle that . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , what it just needs to be as long as it's sort of self-intuitive and you can can work out what everything's doing , 'cause I mean , menus on sort of new phones now they've sort of got all these pictures and stuff which makes it fairly obvious what you're trying to do . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN I don't know , I d I don't like the , you know the new phones that have kind of got a Windows-based running system . 
UNKNOWN But I don't know how Oh yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN I find it really confusing , I kept getting lost in the phone , I di I've not got a new one but uh my friend got a new one and I was trying to do things with it and I just kept getting lost , but that's just me . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Yeah , I don't I don't know how for twenty fi , or twelve Euros fifty how much of a excellent screen you could get , you'd you'd have to sort of keep it down to a black and white L_C_D_ thing anyway , I'd assume . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Is it possible that that for the older generation you could have like an extra button that you press for large printlike you do in large printbooks ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Obviously it displays less on the screen , it displays less on the screen but as long as they can read it that's the main thing . 
UNKNOWN Teletext has got that option as well . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Or what about kind of a dual function ? 
UNKNOWN In that you've got the basic buttons just for your play , volume , programme things and also and then a menu to go into with obvious pictures , obvious symbols and that's where you control recording and things like that . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN The other thing is , just ch chucking into mobile phone f design features again , it could have a flip top remote control so that when you flip over the top , your screen is you can have a bigger screen in the the flip over . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Mm , okay . 
UNKNOWN I think that's a cost thing , I don't I don't know how much we're gonna know about Yes , no that's important . 
UNKNOWN S It might it might save a b bit of space , it's i instead of looking bulky , it might look small . 
UNKNOWN Y Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah ? 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , like smaller . 
UNKNOWN But it might have its cost implications . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN And there's no reason we need to make it look as fashionable and stylish as a mobile phone , it can still be lightweight plastic , you know ? 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Something that's easily moulded and produced . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Sorry I'm treading on your territory guys . 
UNKNOWN No uh uh Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um , right , okay we've got half an hour before the next meeting , so we're all gonna go off and do our individual things . 
UNKNOWN Um I think that's probably about it and then we'll come back and liaise again and I get to do another fantastic PowerPointpresentation. 
UNKNOWN Just just a quick thing about the um about what you're saying about the uh does does it need to be fashionable ? 
CONFIRMATION Sure . 
UNKNOWN The sort of I I had a quick look at the company website and it's like the the uh we put the fashion into electronics , so I think think the whole design thing might be qui I mean you don't you you can still have plastic and it'd look quite good but Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Ah right . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Sure b y yeah . 
UNKNOWN But yeah , I mean it doesn't have to be that , you know th that was my main point , we don't have to use metal , I don't know if using plastic does make it cheaper , I presume it would . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah , yeah . 
UNKNOWN I would it would probably . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I mean there's Sky remote controls and everything . 
UNKNOWN They're kind of moulded and look a bit different , and the Telewest remote controls are silver plastic , which looks a bit smarter , so yeah I guess that's stuff we can think about . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so let's break it up there . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN Okay ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So , see you in half an hour . 
UNKNOWN Do we go back to our room ? 
UNKNOWN I think so , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Mm , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yep ? 
UNKNOWN It's up there ? 
UNKNOWN That screen's black . 
UNKNOWN Alright , okay . 
UNKNOWN Okay , that's fine . 
UNKNOWN Oh God . 
UNKNOWN Are we done ? 
UNKNOWN Right , okay um , this is our second meeting and I might be a bit all over the place . 
UNKNOWN Um , right our agendafor today , do you want us to give you a second ? 
UNKNOWN Uh , no that's okay , sorry . 
UNKNOWN Okay , um I'll go over what we decided last meeting , um , we decided upon a universal control , one handset for all , T_V_ , video equipment . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Sorry . 
UNKNOWN Um , that it was important that the product was accessible to a wide range of consumers , wide age range , not limiting anyone . 
UNKNOWN We decided it was important to reflect the company's image in our product , we put fashion in electronics , you know that kind of s thing . 
UNKNOWN Um , our budget would have to affect um try not to reflect our budget , um that we might have a bit of oh oh you can see it , okay . 
UNKNOWN Um dissonance between what our budget was and what we want it to look like . 
UNKNOWN Um want it to look uncluttered , undaunting to the customer . 
UNKNOWN We discussed a flip-open design , um reducing the size of the control and an electronic panel um for further features like programming , things like that . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um , three presentations, I've got written here so shall we hear from Marketing first ? 
UNKNOWN Um is it okay if I postpone that til later , I just want to get access to a little bit more information , is that okay ? 
UNKNOWN No that's fine , that's fine . 
UNKNOWN Okay , yeah I'll go first . 
UNKNOWN Can I grab the Thanks . 
UNKNOWN Unplug me . 
UNKNOWN What do I have to press ? 
UNKNOWN Oh , F_ eight ? 
UNKNOWN Um , F_N_ function F_ eight . 
UNKNOWN Oh right , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Maybe Yep there we go . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN Okay this is uh the working design , presented by me , the uh Industrial Designer extraordinaire . 
UNKNOWN 'Kay , this is where I went a bit mad with PowerPointso . 
UNKNOWN What the first thing question I asked was what are we trying to design ? 
UNKNOWN Well , a device which basically just sends the signal to the T_V_ to change its state , whether that be the power , or the channel um or the volume , everything is just um some sort of signal to change the state of the T_V_ or other appliance that it's sending the signal to . 
UNKNOWN Um , so I decided I'd have a look at what th other people have designed and try and take some inspiration from that . 
UNKNOWN But uh although we will want to be taking ideas from other people , we wanna make sure that our design stands out and I thought that was something that well it wasn't really my area because I'm dealing with the inside really . 
UNKNOWN So um , yeah I ran out of time so I couldn't do this one as fun as the last one . 
UNKNOWN Um and uh I found out that most uh controls use some form of infrared to send signals to the T_V_ presumably because of the cost issue of uh something like uh the same thing that computers use , wireless and , you don't need to send very much information . 
UNKNOWN Um , most of them are powered by some form of battery . 
UNKNOWN Now our one , I'm I'm not sure whether we want to look at the size issue because most of them are powered by triple A_ batteries but those can be quite bulky so I d I didn't know if you wanted to look at something else um so we could shrink down the size of the control . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Could I can I interject to ask a question there , is that appropriate ? 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah sure . 
UNKNOWN You're saying the triple A_ batteries are small or the surrounding it ? 
UNKNOWN Um no no , if you if you look at if you look at most remote controls they're quite they're quite chunky and that's because of the size of the batteries , they have to be obviously this certain size to fit those batteries in . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Right , the triple A_s are the smallest you can get are they not , right ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah the the well you can you can get the sort of circular round ones but I'm just wondering about power consumption and how much you need to send the data across . 
UNKNOWN They are . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Oh I see . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um , and d which leads sort of onto the next point about 'em being small and easy to carry round . 
UNKNOWN Um , now the ones at the moment are small but I was just wondering if we could look at something a bit smaller . 
UNKNOWN Now the main components I came up with um were obviously the power source for the batteries 'cause otherwise it's not gonna work , uh as I said about the w which batteries we were gonna choose , we can uh discuss that later and then you obviously need something to decode the information that you're putting in from from the controller and to turn it into an i uh infrared signal which we're going to use to send the information . 
UNKNOWN Now these have a wireless range of up to about five metres which is sort of suitable for anyone who's watching the T_V_ unless they're in a cinema , which not most people do so as we're applying to the most audience that should be fine . 
UNKNOWN And then I was uh just had a quick look at the external design but I d I left that mostly to the uh interface designer . 
UNKNOWN And so this is what I had as the basic idea of what we wanna do . 
UNKNOWN It's not a proper circuit , I'm not sure if it'd work or not , I'm not even confident that those are the real um the real way you'd wire it up but anyway , we've just got the the power going to the infrared bulb with the chip and the uh U_I_ interface um which would basically , when you when you pressed anything it would the chip would convert it into some form of I_R_ data which could be decoded by the T_V_ receiver , which obviously means that we're gonna have to conform to whatever um whatever form of communication that the T_V_s are already using and since that that's another use and reason to use that infrared because that's what all T_V_s use at the moment . 
UNKNOWN And then finally , um we want uh the it to be available to a wide audience at a low cost so all the components that I've put forward are uh low in cost so that that should be good . 
UNKNOWN Um it should should be different enough um from the alternative products to get a good consumer base , we were talking about it before and also just something that I was thinking about , uh because they're small they're also easy to lose so if we could look into some way of d dunno some anti-going down the side of the sofa thing that you could have , I th that was just sort of a general point there . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN And that's uh yeah . 
UNKNOWN That's a very important part , it came up in our market research findings too so I can refer to that , whenever you like me to present . 
UNKNOWN Alright okay , and yeah , that's that's what I came up with there , so if you wanna Ooh . 
UNKNOWN Okay , thank you very much . 
UNKNOWN Um , would you like to continue on from that ? 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN Or , maybe move the laptop over . 
UNKNOWN It can be okay , that's okay with me . 
UNKNOWN further . 
UNKNOWN Oops . 
UNKNOWN Why's it not working ? 
UNKNOWN F_ eight , right ? 
UNKNOWN F_ function . 
UNKNOWN Function F_ eight yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Mm why's it in the right ? 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN The plug hasn't come out at the bottom , has it ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , it's connecting . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN No , no yeah it's just . 
UNKNOWN Meter adjusting . 
UNKNOWN Oh , there . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Actually mm some of my points might overlap with what William's just mention , but basically my method was like uh whatever brainstorming we did in the last meeting , just a couple of valuable points and started developing on that and there might be some missing loops in this thing which I think we'll uh take a feedback from the marketing because um , I haven't had some marketing data and basically every product is marketable . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So purpose , as William already said , I would put it to simplify the interaction with T_V_ to make make it as simple as possible . 
UNKNOWN And to summarise I I would say it's it should be user-friendly by being easy to use , rather than having a lot of complex button because you can have an engineering maybe having hundred buttons and maybe having uh a remote control which has the main features like volume control or channel ch changing the channel or whatever . 
UNKNOWN But we are to to make it unique so that people want to buy it , will this two features together . 
UNKNOWN So what the concept is to have a flip-top model . 
UNKNOWN The main functions such as which are like often used will be on the top and the complex functions which say you you can say like the y young generation or trendy generation want to pr say programme their favourite channels or whatever , can be put in the middle part of the f flip-top . 
UNKNOWN So it's like it could be accessed by a wide ra range of uh audience and we can punch in new f features such as uh added features such as shock proof body and maybe a design to appeal to a lot of people . 
UNKNOWN Findings most people prefer us user-friendly rather than complex remote controls because there are times like uh people have used a remote control for say a year or something and they they are not used maybe thirty to forty percent of the buttons so it's not of no use of punching in the uh trying to put in those things in on the top of the remote control and try to confuse the user . 
UNKNOWN As we saw we we have to make a profit also so we we can maybe go for an economies of a higher production mm by fifty million we said ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , with that I think we'll be able to achieve economies of scale also , so we can give in add in more features and make it less costly . 
UNKNOWN Um , that's so this is if you ask me personally , I would make uh flip-top with a trendy uh uh design and s maybe we we should look at also like the buttons whe whether they are like soft or little hard because they are times when the buttons tend to be a bit hard after uh continuous use usage and all that . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So in overall a simple and uh user-friendly design . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Uh any comments like , if you want ? 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN Um , I think we'll chat about it at the end , okay so if anyone wants to write something down that they want to bring up at the end , um Ooh , it's vibrating , that's strange . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah sure . 
UNKNOWN Oh , God . 
UNKNOWN Right , okay . 
UNKNOWN Have I got to keep this here ? 
UNKNOWN I think you'll have to You can't It'll have to this can't be pulled . 
UNKNOWN Does it matter ? 
UNKNOWN I'll have t I'll have to move it won't I ? 
UNKNOWN We just do the best we can . 
UNKNOWN Uh , whoops . 
UNKNOWN You'll have to push it a bit more . 
UNKNOWN Will it manage ? 
UNKNOWN Bit more , oh dear . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN Yeah this is more than enough . 
UNKNOWN There we go , I've got a bit more of the cable . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN There we go . 
UNKNOWN Is that okay ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah I think you can pull it out now . 
THANKS Thank you , just pull it closer a little bit . 
UNKNOWN Uh you should be able to and yeah , there you go . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , you might . 
UNKNOWN Get it right over , okay , thank you . 
UNKNOWN Ah . 
UNKNOWN Look at that . 
UNKNOWN Okay , um , I'm going to look at the functional requirements from the marketing point of view and uh obviously our starting point with marketing is always market research . 
UNKNOWN Um , so that's where we started , we used our our usability lab , the company's usability lab , we did our usual selection methods to get a cross-section of the general public , male and female , all age groups from fifteen upwards and um we observed them in the lab , just their general use of the remote control , you can see we had a hundred subjects there . 
UNKNOWN Our findings , lots of findings , I've just summarised some of them here . 
UNKNOWN The overall thing which I've I've got at the top there in italics is that users dislike the look and feel of current remote controls , so it has obvious design implications there . 
UNKNOWN Um , we found that seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly . 
UNKNOWN Eighty percent would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy , we were quite surprised by that finding , but um that's quite a high proportion of our our , you know , international target group are prepared to spend more money for something that's a bit nicer looking . 
UNKNOWN Um , current remote controls do not match well with the operating behaviour of the user overall . 
UNKNOWN For example , you can see below there , seventy five percent of users zap a lot , so you've got your person sunk back in the sofa channel-hopping . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So again there's power implications there . 
UNKNOWN Um , fifty percent of users only use ten percent of the buttons , so again a big design issue there . 
UNKNOWN Um and possibly we can also cut back on cost if we don't have so many functions actually on the remote control . 
UNKNOWN Um the biggest frustrations that people found with regard to personal preferences were um something that you you mentioned earlier , uh remote controls are often lost in the room , it's a slipping down the back of the sofa type of thing , uh fifty percent were were particularly frustrated by that . 
UNKNOWN Uh thirty four percent of people take said they take too much time to learn to use and I think that ties in with the um the previous finding of people only using ten percent of the buttons , they just can't be bothered to learn about the other functions . 
UNKNOWN Um , um slightly more than a quarter of people said it was bad for uh repetitive strain injury . 
UNKNOWN You know those small movements of the remote control can lead to kind of shoulder and elbow problems . 
UNKNOWN Um the vast majority of the thirty five and under age group would like um a liquid crystal display and speech recognition , again that was to aid I think in uh when they've lost the actual remote control , some kind of speech recognition . 
UNKNOWN Something we didn't put to them , but which I'm thinking of now is um even if perhaps the lost control can give off a bleep every now and again til you find it or a flashing light , possibly . 
UNKNOWN Um , that trend reverses in the older age groups . 
UNKNOWN So thirty fives and unders who would like those two features , that kind of evens out thirty five to forty five and in the older age group it kind of reverses , they're not so bothered with this . 
UNKNOWN I had marvellous tables and things that I could show you , but I think I'll just keep it simple , if there's any more information I can emailyou extra details , is that okay ? 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION That's fine . 
UNKNOWN Right , um we have new project requirements , um we're not going to be using teletext , um apparently the consumers consider it outdated with the internet now . 
UNKNOWN Huh . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um our control is only going to be for T_V_ , it's not going to be a combined control , which limits you know all of the different things that it limits the cost for us , but it also makes it easier to understand for the consumer . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm , so can we not programme a video with this remote control ? 
UNKNOWN It says for T_V_ only , so looks like it's just yeah , I think maybe Sky things like that might be incorporated into it , but I don't know , what do you think ? 
UNKNOWN Just channel-hopping . 
UNKNOWN It just said , for T_V_ only . 
UNKNOWN Would that imply video use ? 
UNKNOWN But I mean , general T_V_ controls do do video as well . 
UNKNOWN T yeah yeah . 
UNKNOWN I d well I dunno 'cause uh the w if you've g Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I mean you bu well som you get com you get combined T_V_ and videos don't you ? 
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm , yes . 
UNKNOWN If yeah and if you got if you got a Sky box , they have one of those plus boxes , you can record straight off the T_V_ anyway so on to on to like the T_V_ hard drive or so . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN I think we assume that it's still got play and stop functions and programming . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Anything about that on the market research or something like regarding whether people want a combined something like that ? 
UNKNOWN Um we didn't really look into that but remember we found that finding that most people only use about uh ten percent of the buttons , I think th th those do tend to be the basic channel-hopping things and on and off for the video , fast-forwarding , so on and I think it's sort of general knowledge that people do find programming their videos a nightmare . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Ten perc Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN So I don't know if that's something we need to look at . 
UNKNOWN Ju um just as an idea on the uh speech recognition thing that pr it'd probably be quite expensive to incorporate an entire speech recognition thing and they're not that great anyway . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Pens Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN In fact I've just called up that table there , we asked those two questions , the table relates to both questions , so we didn't differentiate . 
UNKNOWN Alright , okay . 
UNKNOWN Would you prefer an L_C_D_ screen , that's multi-function remote and would you pay more for speech recognition in a remote control ? 
UNKNOWN Alright , okay . 
UNKNOWN So you can see how the the yes no sort of varies across the age group there , and a substantial number of don't knows in the older age group , I think that's just general fear of new technology . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , bu We do have a budget limitation that we can't control ourselves , so I think when we can take a cheaper option which still does the same kinda thing um because it is something I it needs to be the thing that you use to find it needs to be something that you don't lose , you were saying whistling , maybe on the T_V_ you could put like a pack on the T_V_ or something so you can't see the remote , you go and press the button on top of the T_V_ and it beeps and you're like oh okay it's over there , something like that , but that's that sounds a lot cheaper to me . 
UNKNOWN Yeah but um on on that again I just thought 'cause you can get those key chains now and you whistle and then it'll let off a loud noise to let you know where it is so I thought that could be quite a Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Oh yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN That's a super idea . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um the third thing was that we have to make sure the corporate image is very much incorporated into the handset . 
UNKNOWN Um so we want logo , we want um fashionable , trendy , I mean what you were talking about with the marketing . 
UNKNOWN Um , people paying more for it to look good . 
UNKNOWN Um , we need to focus on that as well . 
UNKNOWN Yes , further market research will be needed to kind of focus on what that is , it's gonna be different for a fifteen year old th for somebody who's sixty and also across the world if we're aiming at the international market . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN What is um attractive to a trendy New Yorker and what is attractive to a retired South African , I dunno , you get the idea . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN It's it's gonna vary around the world . 
UNKNOWN At the end of the day , th the engineering design is one thing , it's the user interface design that may and th the sort of you know fashionable aspect of it we might have to change for different markets round the world . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So are we talking of a single model or maybe five , six designs? 
CONFIRMATION Sure . 
UNKNOWN Well y yeah you could you could have a number of different designsI mean inside they'd be essentially exactly the same . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Just yeah , yeah . 
UNKNOWN The features could be same and the body could look slightly different . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN So Yeah . 
UNKNOWN What about you were talking about the buttons , um the controls that are coming out now have kind of big , rubber buttons , not tiny little one , big , rubber buttons , but what about , I mean , 'cause we got to make it original , what about um you know with the touch screen computers yeah ? 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah that's what I was just yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um so you it's like a little panel that you touch rather than a button which shouldn't wear out as much either , not sure about the You don't have to press it , you just have to put your thumb onto it . 
UNKNOWN No , well no 'cause you wouldn't have to you don't actually have to press them you just Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um , think that might appeal I'm thinking kind of Japan , I'm thinking uh young , um office people , trendy kind of a thing . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yes it will appeal to sections of the market def Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um , but quite , um , easily labelled so that anyone can oh yeah that's obvious what that's for and it's not daunting to maybe the older generations , um Were too big . 
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm , mm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN But also er ergonomics as we're saying with the different designs, ergonomics uh there's sort of physically different things 'cause um if you've ever seen the X_ Box they had to make two different sized controllers because people in Japan wouldn't buy it because the controller was physically to big because um they're c uh just generally Japanese people have smaller hands so they couldn't get round the controller which is uh so if you I don't know what 'cause you obviously you can have bigger buttons for some countries or something and smaller ones for others . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , uh maybe to as uh it it was indicated that uh uh risk uh of uh repeated use , the injuries , maybe a touch screen could be a better option for that . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So , a bigger b okay so y you're dividing designsbased on not only segment age groups , you're desi uh dividing it according to the countries also , the market . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Maybe for U_S_ and all you can have a slightly bigger remote control and maybe in Japan and all you need to have a small , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN I think we have to design one product and then the company can take it wherever they want to uh in the sense that they can make it smaller , or they can make it bigger or they can change the features slightly , um . 
UNKNOWN Huh . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Th the internal d engineering design has got to remain the same , yes , absolutely . 
UNKNOWN It's gonna be the same , so we need to focus on just one thing , not get bogged down in lots of different um possibilities , um . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN I'm concerned , when you read the the R_S_I_ issue again , repetitive strain injury , I don't think just moving your finger around on a small screen is going to deal with that enough , I think that is still a kind of a question mark issue how we deal with that . 
UNKNOWN Um , R_S_I_ tends to be caused by repetitive small movements . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I'm j I really can't get my head round this one , this may have to be postponed to a future meeting but it's something we should think about . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I yeah I was just thinking about how you could combat that 'cause without without doing something where you have to move your arm around to change the channel and it becomes yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN I know , and it becomes ridiculous , yes I know . 
UNKNOWN Or a speech recognition , which is extremely expensive , I think that's the only way that you kind of avoid that kind of issue . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , speech recognition , but yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Do we have to initially um , you know looking at the findings here , focus on a younger age group initially and then broaden out the market later . 
UNKNOWN Do we really have to go for everyone right away ? 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN We could focus on the biggest market . 
CONFUSION Um . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Ge uh Yeah . 
UNKNOWN If say people between age group of twenty to thirty five are the biggest market ? 
UNKNOWN And when we've been throwing up our ideas we're automatically talking about business people , young people , trendy people . 
UNKNOWN We are we're talking about um the type of company that we're working for as well . 
UNKNOWN That they want um it to be fashionable , they want it to be trendy and you wouldn't automatically assume associate that with the older generations . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Now with the baby boomers , the older generations are actually larger , they have a greater population than us young people , but I don't think we're focusing on that , I think we are focusing on a sort of mid-range um , business kind of class type people . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN I'm just thinking of budgetary issues too , for when it does get to the sort of broad scale marketing stage , we want to , you know , not waste money , not be profligate and uh you know focus on where the idea will be taken up , first it's most likely to be taken up first of all where the main purchasing power is coming from for a product like this . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so the remote control functions . 
UNKNOWN Um we've got the T_V_ , we've got the video , now there's um I can't remember what it's called , the little code at the end of programme details , yes . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Video plus . 
UNKNOWN We could use that as an alternative to programming in times , things like that , is that I always found that really easy when I discovered it , um because you've got your general record anyway so if you there's a programme on you want to put record on , that's fine , but if you do want to tape something in two days time and you're not sure if you're going to , you put the number in and it's just a number , it's not a date , it's not a time , it's not a channel , it's not when it finishes , it's not anything like that , it's just a number . 
UNKNOWN Yeah yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Just whack in the number . 
UNKNOWN And you w yeah . 
UNKNOWN And you wouldn't you wouldn't need uh a whole host of extra buttons for that , you just need one 'cause you've already got all the numbers there anyway , yeah . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN You've already got the numbers for typing in anyway . 
UNKNOWN Right , I've not come across that function but it sounds wonderful . 
UNKNOWN It is after um if you look in the newspaper , T_V_ guide or any T_V_ guide there's a five , six digit number afterwards and that's the number you put in and it's recorded that it's going to be on on Tuesdays at ten o'clock on the seventeenth so you don't have to worry about dates and you don't have to worry about times , um and it has been around for quite a long time . 
UNKNOWN It's not Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Ah , hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN It's been been around for a long time it's just it's not very well advertised as to how to use it and things . 
UNKNOWN No it's not um but I think if awareness was kind of brought to the forefront about that Mm . 
UNKNOWN Superb . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN Though if y if you've got something like Sky anyway you can just click on it you can just press the button on the programme once and it'll record that programme when it's on and you press it on it twice and it'll record the whole series . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Excellent , mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So that yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN But just to have that function would be would be really good . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Okay so Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Can I just run this past you while it occurs to me , I don't mean to quickly jump from one subject to another , but just discussing the different age groups and targeting the different age groups it occurs to me , to produce our own mobile phones , that that's kind of what led us on to comparing T_V_ remote controls with with their design features , um , chain companies like Carphone Warehouse , you can pop in anytime with a phone that you bought for them w if you've got any problems with it and they'll fix it , they'll phone the company , you can use their telephones . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Is it worthwhile with with our retail outlets having a a similar um kind of service so that if older users were deterred from buying this , if they know they can just pop into one of our high street outlets , th you know , which button is it I press for this ? 
UNKNOWN Th as free as a free aspect of our service , would that not make it more attractive to them ? 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN But the only problem is that with a mobile phone you signed for a contract so they um the companies who uh who you deal with have actually they've they've got an obligation to to help you out and also I mean it's it's fair enough to have some sort of help service but I I'm not sure how much the cost would be of having Yeah , I mean I mean instru instruction books I feel c I reckon can cover that . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN The functionality of it in the sense that you're sitting there , you're pressing this button and your T_V_'s not doing it . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
UNKNOWN Taking your T_V_ and your control and saying look this is what I'm doing , it's not working , what should I do ? 
UNKNOWN Yes If it was something as simple as you couldn't change the channel , but I mean for if there were any more or are we absolutely definite it's only gonna be for T_V_ and video , we're not gonna put any okay , just a thought . 
UNKNOWN I think so . 
UNKNOWN Um Instruction manuals . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN But I mean they're there's customer service , there will be a customer service number thing that you can phone up and speak to and that way there's no call out charge , there's no extra , t the person has to walk to a shop on the high street , um . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Department , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Sure . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think it will be too much of an effort for a person to for a phone maybe he might walk down the street , but for a remote he will just refer to the manual and all that . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Not for such simple functions because we're focusing on that , yes okay . 
UNKNOWN And they're yeah , they should be f yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN But we should focus on making the manual as user-friendly as possible because a lot of them are just tiny little writing and lots and lots of pages. 
UNKNOWN Simple . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Puts people off reading them so they just do the obvious , yes . 
UNKNOWN It's the uh yeah . 
UNKNOWN It does , you just put it in the drawer until something goes wrong and then you try and search through it , so that should be something we think about . 
UNKNOWN Sure , okay . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um , what other functions ? 
UNKNOWN We need I'm not sure if we need a design um decision now , but we should think about c 'cause you've got the dilemma between oh batteries , that's what I was thinking about . 
UNKNOWN Mobile phone batteries , what kinda battery is that ? 
UNKNOWN Um they're they're specially made for the for the mobile phones , but they come with a charger , I mean you could you could bundle a charger in with it but Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Well they la they they last quite a long time , and if you had uh when you th the thing that you get with mobile house phones , you sit it in its charger when you're not using it or t at night or something , but it doesn't really matter 'cause it never really runs out 'cause it lasts a long time once it is charged . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um , something like that should reduce the size of it . 
UNKNOWN Yeah and if yeah if you if you had if you had one of those uh just coming back to your other point about pressing the button and setting off the bleeper in the room that could uh Yeah on that as well so . 
UNKNOWN Yeah it could be on that yeah , okay . 
UNKNOWN S Yes . 
UNKNOWN So are we talking of a concept of a rechargeable something on the remote ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah some sort of docking station or yeah . 
UNKNOWN Rechargeable with a docking station . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So the rechargeable which would be your field . 
UNKNOWN Yeah yeah th yeah that that'd be fine , and also that would mean they wouldn't have to go out buying batteries all the time . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Yes , which it is cheaper in the long run as well . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um , th the shape you got trendy . 
UNKNOWN I don't wanna big box with lots of things , you don't want a tiny sort of little thing either , because then you have got the repetitive strain injury no matter how many how much you try and make it simple , um They do . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN And we don't w I mean so many remote controls look absolutely identical , these long , brown things with the same coloured buttons all crammed in on the s the surface . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN We definitely an ob an obvious thing , a very simple thing is to get away from these brown rectangles , we don't want that . 
UNKNOWN Okay so we've got a flip-screen . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um Okay . 
UNKNOWN What I was thinking of a design which Nokia h uh came up with almost six or seven years back . 
UNKNOWN Basically we have a flat one it it looks like a box , like a chocolate . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN That's very strenuous because your thumb is slightly up , so they came up with something like this , curled up , so here , and you don't have to you don't bend your thumb too much , so it's like uh you can say a banana shape kind of thing , curled up like a boat . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Slightly curved , curved . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN G uh so what happens is you don't have to press your thumb too down like . 
UNKNOWN So it's already curled up so your thumb doesn't y yeah so we can have a s like you know moulded according to your the way you h hold of it's kind of semi-circular in the bottom , something like that . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause it's kind of moulded to your hand anyway . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN I wouldn't say exactly semi-circular but yeah smooth . 
UNKNOWN Can you look into the company logo ? 
UNKNOWN Um , things that are associated with the company in view to trying to incorporate that into the design of the product . 
UNKNOWN Current . 
UNKNOWN I mean for example , if it was a C_ or something like that , you could have it in a vague C_ shape that opens up kind of like a shell , or something , um something along those lines to be able to incorporate it quite um obviously into the design , while also making it quite different from anything else that's there . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN We could look in at that but Mm . 
UNKNOWN I mean look at the mobile . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN What we were talking is to make it more rather than like sea-shells , logo could become as you could put a logo in the corner of uh the model , rather than you know , trying to make it like a sea shell or whatever you were ta telling like . 
UNKNOWN Well we need to think about how it's gonna look different . 
UNKNOWN I think that's that sounds a really attractive idea , I've not come across anything like that before , if it kind of yeah and that opens out into your flip-top . 
UNKNOWN A sea shell ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Then it's nice t to h you can make it lightweight plastic , nice to hold in the palm of the hand and just because you're having to actually insert in between the two covers , that's gonna take care of some of the repetitive strain injury trying p prevent a lot of that I would think . 
UNKNOWN I think it's a really nice idea and plus you can get you know even though we're using plastic , you can still I mean think of the designsyou can get in plastic , we can do a nice conch shell or scallop shell exterior . 
UNKNOWN Yeah we could look in at that . 
UNKNOWN Or you could do um different , like you get with mobile phones , different fascias . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN You could have different kind of casings . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So you could have like psychedelic ones for younger people and sleek ones and Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Less chance of it being lost too , it's not like a chocolate brown lozenge that's gonna go down the sofa and people might want to put it on their mantelpiece or whatever as a ki if it looks attractive enough as a kind of ornament they don't not gonna lose it so much either . 
UNKNOWN It's easier to bit nice to handle . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah maybe we could come at some say five , six des designsand then choose which are whichever appeals the most like , that could be the most common design . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN But we can like think of five , six designs. 
UNKNOWN Right , I think we have to round it up , um Sure . 
UNKNOWN Can I just quickly um go over the new project requirements so that I haven't missed anything . 
UNKNOWN So it's no teletext , it's only for T_V_ and by implication video , our corporate image should be incorporated in the remote control , um something about Videoplus . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN That was um in cutting down the number that was kinda separate that was cutting down the number of functions , making it simpler so instead of having lots of things you put in for date It's kinda takes the place of having a button to press for the date and having the button to press for the channel , things like that . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Right , so when they press for programming you it comes up on the L_C_D_ , a reminder about using Videoplus ? 
UNKNOWN So that they have a look at the guide and Or was is this nothing to do with the project requirements , is this just that was an add-on feature ? 
UNKNOWN Uh-huh . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Right , so it's kind of doing away with the programming feature ? 
UNKNOWN Um it could be it c It yes , it could be uh adv advertisement feature , um rather than design feature , you know , drawingattention to that . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN And it also paid um lip service in the instruction manual , 'cause it's very simple so putting it down in words should be helpful . 
UNKNOWN Mm , and the rechargeable batteries . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Was there anything else there that we in the new new project requirements ? 
UNKNOWN Um We've got the buttons but I think we'll work through that with the design of it , um . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN That's not at the moment a requirement , it's something we're looking at , what preference so it may come round to market research at some point to see what people would like . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN And we've talked about um there being an alarm or something , a beeping for being lost , um . 
UNKNOWN For detection , right . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Learning how to use it should be as simple as possible . 
UNKNOWN But there aren't gonna be that func that many functions incorporated into it so it should be fine and the I the instruction manual , I don't know if we deal with that , um . 
UNKNOWN I think Yep , and different from what's out there . 
UNKNOWN Yep , I think True . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Yep , I think that's us . 
UNKNOWN What would you specifically like marketing to look at before the next meeting ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Or shall I just sort of generally look at all the issues involved ? 
UNKNOWN I think you might get guidance , but um I th Instruction manuals , 'cause there tends to be a demonised thing , u um , they're everyone's got like a big pile of them , but no one really uses them . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Whoops , questionnaire four . 
UNKNOWN Oops . 
UNKNOWN We should f I think it's time for us to get back to Help . 
UNKNOWN Yes , right . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause we're at lunchtime now I think . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Right , okay . 
UNKNOWN I think you can emailme , if there's any more questions . 
UNKNOWN Um and I'll be able to not answer them . 
UNKNOWN I'll wait until you're all um hooked up . 
UNKNOWN Oh good grief . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN Put it on in that way . 
UNKNOWN Oops . 
CONFIRMATION Thanks . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Welcome back everybody , hope you've had fun . 
UNKNOWN After lunch . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Right um this is our conceptual design meeting , um I think we're slightly ahead of ourselves from the last meeting , I th I I think yeah um . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah I was getting that impression as well . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN This is where we talk about um properties , materials , user-interface and trend-watching . 
UNKNOWN Etcetera . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So I think we've touched on a few things to do with that already , but we'll just go over it . 
UNKNOWN Um the minutesfrom the last time . 
UNKNOWN Um we had a couple of um changes in our plans in that we couldn't use teletext , it wasn't gonna be a control for everything um and that we had to incorporate the image of the company into it somehow . 
UNKNOWN Um we have decided on a leaving out the voice recognition , we've decided on there being a flip design and um a different shape from what's normal . 
UNKNOWN We were thinking a shell , but something along those lines , just a different shape from what's normal , um . 
UNKNOWN You were going to look into the rechargeable batteries and we were gonna think about the port and an alarm for getting it lost , things like that , um and our market was going to be young , business , kind of range . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so shall we start with the first presentation? 
UNKNOWN Shall I ? 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN Yes if you feel It's okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN We just connect up . 
THANKS Thank you . 
UNKNOWN There we go . 
UNKNOWN Okay um so we decided on our market and so this feedback from the marketing department is really about trend watching . 
UNKNOWN Um the methods we used to decide on uh current trends and so on , market trends , were that we did our traditional uh our usual market research study uh with a hundred subjects and the the general feedback from them is that the most im uh w I'm sorry I'm slightly tongue-tied after lunch , sorry Project Manager . 
UNKNOWN Um we decided on the most important aspect i uh required in a remote control device and we'll come to that later . 
UNKNOWN So that was one of the first things we did . 
UNKNOWN Also with our company um being forerunners in uh putting fashion into technology , we also looked at a fashion update um using our consultants on fashion and design in Paris and Milan . 
UNKNOWN Uh so the general findings from that was uh in the market trends the most important aspect for remote controls were people want a fancy look and feel , rather than the the current functional look and feel of remote controls . 
UNKNOWN They also also want a remote control to be technologically innovative , and of course , as we predicted , that it should be easy to use . 
UNKNOWN Now I should point out that the first of those findings , fancy look and feel , is the most important , is twice as important as the second , technologically innovative , which is in turn twice as important as being easy to use . 
UNKNOWN So possibly that the feature that we put first is actually third is still important , but it's third in order of preference for the the subject group we looked at . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay , um , now the fashion update which relates to very personal preferences among our subject group , um we found from our um consultants in Paris and Milan who des attended all the design and fashion fairs there , that fruit and vegetables are going to be the theme for clothes , shoes and furniture . 
UNKNOWN So should we be thinking of using something like that in our remote control design too ? 
UNKNOWN There also seems to be um a trend towards a spongy feel to materials , uh again in contrast to last year . 
UNKNOWN So a lot of interesting feedback there , both from our market research departments and from our people in Paris and Milan . 
UNKNOWN Be interesting to see what our design people make of that . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN Okay thank you very much . 
UNKNOWN Um let's start from the inside and work our way out . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN Fine . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , okay . 
UNKNOWN It's okay with me . 
UNKNOWN Unless anyone has any questions about that ? 
UNKNOWN Not yet ? 
UNKNOWN I don't think so , not yet . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN Um , yes , thank you . 
UNKNOWN That screwed in ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN I hate those little things especially if you do them on too tight and you can't get the leverage on them to undo them . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I know . 
UNKNOWN 'Kay , Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um this is uh all about the design of the actual components and the availability of the components we have in stock at the moment . 
UNKNOWN Okay , first uh the Into the method . 
UNKNOWN The the main idea of the whole thing is just so you sh you just press buttons and it should activate things on the T_V_ and we discussed last meeting that it should be easy to find . 
UNKNOWN Um also in this study I've looked into the availability of some of the materials , 'cause some of the things that we looked at last time aren't un unfortunately aren't available . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN Um , findings , I've got my nice little picture there . 
UNKNOWN This is uh the chip called the T_A_ double one eight three five which is what's used in pretty much every remote control 'cause it sends out standard signals , based on your input and um it's pretty much used for all all T_V_ remotes at the moment . 
UNKNOWN . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN Um and then we we're loo looking into battery options . 
UNKNOWN There's um actually no rechargeable option available , so we I saw the um the standard double A_ and triple A_ which we thought were a bit bit too bulky at the moment , dynamo charging , I thought that that might be a bit silly to be to be honest , people won't it's it's basically like wind-up radio . 
UNKNOWN Wa can you explain that ? 
UNKNOWN Like a right , okay . 
UNKNOWN So you wind up your remote control before you use it . 
UNKNOWN How what kind of how l long can you get out of that , I mean can you pick it up and then wind it for two minutes and then that's it for the night ? 
UNKNOWN It might You Yeah , yeah , oh yeah I presu you wouldn't have to wind it for very long , but I don't I don't think it's really sort of necessary when you th you think of the next two options , like the the solar charging , 'cause most people have the light on in the room anyway so they could get when when you got T_V_ . 
UNKNOWN Or That doesn't count though does it ? 
UNKNOWN Does does light charge as as sunlight does ? 
UNKNOWN I thought it was U_V_ like Any , any I'm pretty sure that solar is from the sun . 
UNKNOWN Artificial light ? 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN Is it ? 
UNKNOWN Alright i Yeah it would the d yeah the dynamo would take more space 'cause you actually need a physical sort of handle to wind up . 
UNKNOWN Has to be solar . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN Regarding those sizes , which one you think will be light because we we have to take into consideration size also , so maybe a standard triple A_ might take lesser space or and dynamo might take more space . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , okay . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Uh , I don't think it counts electric lights no , but I mean not many you don't want to limit your market . 
UNKNOWN Artificial light , no . 
UNKNOWN That's going to I know , different parts of the world too , if we're if we're marketing internationally . 
UNKNOWN I mean people who live in basement flats there's not that many people , but there are people . 
UNKNOWN Uh Right . 
UNKNOWN But Yeah and most people most people also watch T_V_ in the in the night anyway . 
UNKNOWN Night . 
UNKNOWN Mm , but then it would be charging through the day , I think the point is that it charges through the day and then you've got it charged for the evening . 
UNKNOWN But I I think I think the the next one's the best anyway . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN The the kinetic charging which is like you get it in r you get it in wrist watches and you d you don't even notice it . 
UNKNOWN Yeah I've seen But then if you think about a watch , it's on your wrist so it's on your whole bod it's on your body the whole time so you're walking around , you're doing things , it is moving a lot of the time . 
UNKNOWN I mean the amount the amount of probably moving around you'd be doing all the time would would charge it up , I don't think you'd ever need to actually physically start shaking it up to make it work . 
UNKNOWN And are these like uh what are the life of the kinetic battery , it like it runs for long time ? 
UNKNOWN Um yeah it's it charges into um some form of it's a smaller cell which it charges into and uh the si the size sort of a watch a watch battery , 'cause they use them quite frequently in watches . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN And that'll that would l would last for um well I do I d I'm not entirely sure how long it would last but I've never seen one run out . 
UNKNOWN We c Solar would be slightly expensives . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah and Yeah but then again I I think it is because if you think about it , the watch , although it's only a tiny amount it's it's um it's always moving for the whole day and they don't run out over night when you leave them on the side . 
UNKNOWN If you'd I mean you switch the T_V_ on , then you put it on the side , then you pick it up to change it and then you put it on the side . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Is it really gonna be enough ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN And th for the same the same reason , you're only using it for a v incredibly short amount of time just to send the signal and then you're finished with it and you put it no no I do I don't think the the drawon it would be Mm . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN So it's not the drawon it isn't Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Could I just ask referring back to solar charging , is that compatible with um standard batteries ? 
UNKNOWN I mean , could people put standard batteries in but with a s you know they could leave it in the sunlight for solar charging or the two things not compatible ? 
UNKNOWN Ye yeah I think I th uh g y you could have a dual um power thing but the the thing with the solar cells is you would need to put them on the case and they because , if you lie on a calculator they they're qui they're quite big and they all they all look i identical . 
UNKNOWN Like a dual kind of . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN So that affects the exterior design . 
UNKNOWN Expensive as well . 
UNKNOWN They're they're expensive , they don't Yeah the normal batteries would be the cheapest I'd presume then it would actually be the the solar charging ones , um but the It's i I think they're not very resistant to dropping , 'cause if you drop stuff yeah if you if you have y the size you'd need to charge a remote wouldn't be that big but I mean if remotes always get thrown around and stuff , so . 
UNKNOWN What kind of price are we looking at for I presume the normal batteries are the cheapest ? 
UNKNOWN It's twelve point f Another question is like sorry . 
UNKNOWN Solar . 
UNKNOWN Well they're not designed Practical-wise okay . 
UNKNOWN Y I think yeah , practically . 
UNKNOWN I mean calculators you don't really throw around a lot whereas remotes you do , they can t Yeah they do , they yeah they've got dual things , but they're the batteries are smaller I think . 
UNKNOWN You do get a bit of wear but don't calculators have a battery in them as well ? 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Again it de Mm . 
UNKNOWN W w which one would last the longest , because we don't want customers to be like you know charging like a mobile phone every day . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN A remote control , like , so we have to s look at the life also . 
UNKNOWN W m yeah so the Yeah the the s if you if you had something du uh using the standard batteries and the solar charging , um , I don't think you'd I think the it would d well you know how long the standard double A_s would last in or triple A_s would last . 
UNKNOWN It would just detract from the attractiveness of the of the whole feature , i it's not gonna add anything , okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah I think i I think it would , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay , can we add in uh an attachment to closing feature ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Can we think about that ? 
UNKNOWN 'Cause if we're doing the kinetic thing and it's Well add it in to think about um because , where am I ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Shouldn't we do some market research on that first before we add it in because I I personally right , okay . 
UNKNOWN If it is the kinetic thing and it is small and it is portable and it is a different shape and the kinetic is something people don't do kind of we're doing something original and different um but if you wore it if it's something you could just clip on your pocket then you would have that less , you you wouldn't lose it so much . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But then maybe that's looking at someone who's just sitting on their own rather than the eternal battle for control of the controls . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It's not something that's come up in any of our uh focus groups and market research , it's not a thing that people are looking for when we threw it open to the field yeah . 
NEGATION No . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN But it's something to put on the side to think about maybe . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Okay , right . 
UNKNOWN Okay , well I'll move on . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um , my second part of my findings uh the mo most current remotes use this silicone uh P_C_B_ board which pr printed circuit board , which basically has these contacts that are really close together and then when you press down on the rubber button , it'll connect the circuit and each each switch is connected to two uh different legs on the chip and so sends a different message and that then uh gets translated by the chip into a code and then it's fired out of this L_E_D_ in the sequence of l on and off bursts . 
UNKNOWN What kind of things do we have to consider there ? 
UNKNOWN Can we what kind of size , does it come in varying sizes or is it just one size and we would have to fit the design of Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Well well this the thi the thing about is um they they can be as big or as small as you want them to be because you can you can printcircuit board like that that it's it's simply spaced like that so you can have fit the n the size of the nine buttons in . 
UNKNOWN If you if you see how thin the tracks are , you could you could s you could put them virtually right next to each other and have a much smaller switch on each one , if you if you wanted to but um the there is an option to do to do it like that , or you could have some sort of array of switches which I'll speak about in the next bit so that And then to uh yeah , so to conserve battery life the remote should be in a standby mode no while not being used . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Now what I was thinking about that was 'cause sometimes when y when you have these things , they've got little lights on behind the buttons , so you can see what all the buttons are , like on a mobile phone , they do it more often than on a than on a T_V_ remote , but you could you could have lights behind the buttons and um after like five or ten seconds of not being used I'd have that turned off , if we decided to go for buttons that could light up . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um , the case material , I've a been sent what the factory can actually give us , the there's the plastic which I think we were gonna go for anyway as the main case case housing and the the main problems with the well you could go for wood but I think it would be a bit impractical . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Titanium um very expensive just to process , which to make it is expensive , and rubber , well you're saying that people like this uh spongy feel this year , so perhaps uh some something made of rubber , but I was thinking more of the buttons , because the buttons which they've they've said that they've they've put across are what is used in some stress ball manufacture and it's meant to be anti R_S_I_ . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN I'm no I'm not sure how that would work because surely your fingers would still be moving over the short distances but that's what they said . 
UNKNOWN Um the problem with the casing is that uh there's quite um there's quite a few design restrictions that they've got on the shape of the case . 
UNKNOWN If you go for titanium they can only do a standard box shape , whereas if you come to plastic they can they can be a little more they can they can do sort of curved shapes . 
UNKNOWN But whether whether or not because we'd have it in two separate units for the flip phone . 
UNKNOWN Second thing is yeah and second question is like , a mobile you can change the cover , you call it a skin or whatever . 
UNKNOWN Hinged , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So in this case if you're looking at like a customer can change the colour like from green , parrot green to chilli red or something like that . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah I th Uh . 
UNKNOWN So is that feature available in like uh titanium , or it's like only specific to plastic or Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah in in titanium I don't I don't think it would be available at all really , the ju just it w well you could make it available in the titanium , it was just it would be so expensive to buy a new case for it , because of the expense of how much titanium is is it's light and strong but I think it should be left for aircraft design rather than for for a remote . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN It does mark quite easily too if you let it fall . 
UNKNOWN I've got a mobile phone myself which is titanium and it does mark very easily if you drop it . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah . 
UNKNOWN I was just wondering if we make the basic mould out of plastic but have like a rubber cover that goes over , that would give the spongy feel , that also allows us to kind of have different fasciae for the phone . 
UNKNOWN Rubber , yeah . 
UNKNOWN And you can peel them off yeah . 
UNKNOWN So instead of the fascia that comes off being plastic , the fascia that comes off would be the rubber , like those pens that you get with the grip , that you can you can pull that off . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Like a rubber sleeve almost , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Something like Alright . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN That could be a good idea . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN It could it would be comfortable to hold on also . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Very cheap way of changing the look of it and people can just buy a new one if they want to . 
UNKNOWN T Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well that's been really popular with mobile phones so I don't see why not . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Also the just just going back to the interface designswith the buttons , the I kno we were planning to do some sort of touch screen . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Now what I was saying before about instead of having you could have just a bare P_C_B_ circuit board and I'm sure you could probably get it in different colours and so just by touching it with your finger it'd make the connection over if you had them close enough , that would be one option . 
UNKNOWN Um the second option th they offer rubber buttons , but I thought that an L_C_D_ type of screen 'cause one they're incredibly thin um and don't take up much space , two they you can have them in a sort of array and you can arrange the buttons on the screen in a sort of set thing and you could have them like a touch display . 
UNKNOWN Sorry I didn't get the last part , you're talking of Just what you said I I didn't get the uh meaning of it completely , you're saying like Uh-huh . 
UNKNOWN Uh what what Oh on the on the L_C_D_ screen you could becau you could fit it the problem with it basically is that it's flat and so you can't do lots of curve curved things with it , but um you can you wouldn't have with the L_C_D_ you'd have the wires coming off , you wouldn't have that with the with the L_C_D_ , you'd only have that with the printed circuit board . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN With W also with the Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I don't s sorry to interrupt , I don't see why the curved thing is a problem , if we for example had a shell , once we open that yeah , so it'd be f yeah , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Oh it would be flat inside . 
UNKNOWN You could have a flat screen inside , yeah , but I'm just wondering whether we want an L_C_D_ screen inside . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Have I misunderstood you ? 
UNKNOWN It wouldn't be like full colour , it would just be black and white , but there'd be touch touch buttons , so you wouldn't be pressing down on 'em , w or we could have rubber buttons which are made of this material which is anti-R_S_I_ . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN I think it would be good to have a contrast between , if the whole thing is gonna be this rubber thing it would be good to open it up and see something quite fancy looking inside . 
UNKNOWN Is rubber . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Now how would you distinguish , if you had it bare , how would you distinguish where you had to press , I mean Uh Like one of the palm pop thing . 
UNKNOWN Yeah I hadn't I hadn't really thought of that to be honest . 
UNKNOWN I just had another idea , I don't know if it helps with that , but just to do with the R_S_I_ . 
UNKNOWN Is it possible , just as an option , when we open it up , people can use their fingers to press the button , or we have inside like a small pointer thing when people want to . 
UNKNOWN Yeah you could , you could have some sort of stylus that you could pull out but I I think they could get a bit easily lost , 'cause I had Hmm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Absolutely , f for somebody who very often , if he would a person who switches channels very often or does use a particular function very often will find it very irritating to use a and he might spoil the touch-pad very fast compared to a button like , if you keep punching with an pointer or whatever . 
UNKNOWN They're easy to replace as well , cheap . 
UNKNOWN It would have to be attached . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah just a thought they wouldn't actually need one and they could use anything they've got , couldn't they ? 
UNKNOWN A pencil or a pen , so they wouldn't really need a Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Okay , we'll talk about that so if you finish your and we'll come back to that . 
UNKNOWN Yeah that's yeah that that's the end of m my Yeah . 
UNKNOWN That's you , right okay . 
UNKNOWN And just one small question before like you are , regarding the circuit , since we are hav having a flip-top , we can customise the two circuits for different type of buttons like we are keeping the standard buttons on the top and the more complex buttons under this thing , so we can divide the circuit like you know . 
UNKNOWN Uh yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah yeah that that would be fairly simple , I mean you'd you'd actually have two separate you'd have two separate circuit boards but they'd be joined by wires or like some cabling between them , 'cause in the in the actual flip bit you'd have some linking . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN I'll just raise another point while it occurs to me , it kind of applies to both our designers here , so I'm not sure how it would fit in . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN If we flip open , now you know how you've got some mirrors in nightclubs that are mirrors when you turn to them and you turn away and it gives like an advertising display , you seen those ? 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN And they kind of respond to the turn of your body . 
UNKNOWN Is it possible that when we open our flip-top shell it's a little compact mirror and when you press a button it then goes onto the phone display th uh the remote control display thing . 
UNKNOWN We're marketing to guys as much as we are to women . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN They don't look at themselves ? 
UNKNOWN Just a thought . 
UNKNOWN Well it's a remote control , you were sitting watching T_V_ are you gonna want to sort of open it and say oh shit I should go and have a shower and do my hair before I put the T_ Yeah , no , no . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I know what you mean , it's with us using the ideas for a mobile ph it's with us using the ideas for mobile phones I kinda got sidetracked onto that I think , okay . 
UNKNOWN trying to think of other features we can build in that wouldn't cost too much but maybe we'll leave that one on the side . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN I mean you can you could do it , you could have a 'cause if you if you just put the full charge through an L_C_D_ display it'll completely blank it out , but I don't know if you could get any mirror effect on it , I'm not sure about Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Oh I think forget about the mirror that was just a very quick passing thought yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay , okay . 
UNKNOWN Okay , uh would like to share something which I did here . 
UNKNOWN First thing is uh basically on design we just took the input from the previous meeting , especially from the marketing and industrial design , to check on the customer needs and feasibility . 
UNKNOWN Second is we checked into competitors , the picture here shows one of the standard models offered by competitors here . 
UNKNOWN So y you generally see there's not much of variety and like marketing team said uh , people need trendy , they are bored of black and white . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN So you generally see rectangular shape , very monotonous kind of designshere . 
UNKNOWN And uh second thing is there's too much of confusion here . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN No particular remote is standard . 
UNKNOWN Like , some some people have a Here you see this ? 
UNKNOWN This is on a I I I found th that uh only common feature is the ch uh channel control and uh volume control , rest other buttons , they are in a very disorganized and they are not consistent th with other models and all . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Okay , and second as already discussed with William , we are going to have m maybe a G_ G_U_I_ interface in the f in the middle of the flip-top and g graphic user interface basically which is what we d do in computer , have icons or touch pad or whatever , which is Like you have on a l uh icons or something y you have is a good example of G_U_I_ graphic user interface . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Sorry what does that stand for ? 
UNKNOWN Which means Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN If you if yeah if you have like buttons that appear on the screen in this L_C_D_ screen . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So basically not point or click Press any particular device , he just has to click on that particular icon to simplify . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN And on the top m repetitive buttons which are like volume or channel changing and all could be on the pointing device , that means the use of button . 
UNKNOWN So he need not use a pointer to keep changing the channel if a person is frequent surfer . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So we are having a combination of boards , so f on the s simpler board , on the top we have this button , rubber buttons , to keep frequently changing the channels . 
UNKNOWN Can we swap that round so th that the ones that we use all the time are on the bottom part ? 
UNKNOWN 'Cause if you're thinking about holding it you would be using your thumbs to press , just like a mobile phone . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN No you'd hold it you don't if you flip it open then you'd be Wouldn't you ? 
UNKNOWN Isn't that the idea ? 
UNKNOWN You us if we just use the shell as an example again , you open that , you've got your L_C_D_ display there and you've got the buttons there so you're holding it in the palm of your hand , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah but you can do it with your thumb li Yeah . 
UNKNOWN That's what I was just saying , and then have the and then have the L_C_D_ at the top and then be able to touch that for the other controls , so have the um the volume and the programme , things like that , on the lower side . 
UNKNOWN But Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Okay and you mean to the And the lower distance . 
UNKNOWN Oh f perfect . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So the findings are too many cluttered buttons . 
UNKNOWN Repetition of certain but buttons which I already explained , example the volume and channel control buttons . 
UNKNOWN All are confusing and in inconsistent . 
UNKNOWN Okay we had a latest finding of voice recognition , there was a mailwhich mentions that our division has developed a new speech recognition s feature . 
UNKNOWN We have to check into the for financial f feasibility whether we can incorporate it this at a low cost , but for like we had g um s response from the customers that they would like to have the feature of finding it . 
UNKNOWN So it could be like , where is the remote , and the remote answers I am here . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Some kind of thing or it gives a b bleep sound or some kind of sound and if this can be incorporated this would be more uh you can say trendy also ? 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN And technologically innovative also . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So we we can check into the financial feasibility of incorporating this . 
UNKNOWN My personal preferences would be like , as already uh marketing department , they want something to do with fruit so I wouldn't say the design should be like a fruit , but yeah we can take inspiration from fruit colours , like the vibrant colours , uh red chilli uh tomato red or whatever and second thing is cer certain standard buttons we should have , like for example , i if you see the previous slideuh I think most of the users would now be well acquainted with this cer central pattern , here , so we we we would not change h that particular pattern because i this is the most consistent thing in all remote controls . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well , yeah we Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I can't see that , is that play and stop and things ? 
UNKNOWN This is central one , the one you yeah volume and channel . 
UNKNOWN Or is that volume and channel ? 
UNKNOWN So keep that m that standardised because that's the most common feature across all models , if you look at all the models , it's here . 
UNKNOWN This and voice recognition . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um I'm not sure how long we've got left , but we need to make a decision about um the things we've discussed . 
UNKNOWN So , we agree on Do we agree on the battery ? 
UNKNOWN Kinetic ? 
UNKNOWN The kinetic . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um , that means that there's no function for li the port , you know that it sits in , then pressing the button then having so we could incorporate voice recognition for the finding it . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah I think I mean if Yeah it is it is qui it's quite a cool feature to have and also if they've got it if they've got these parts already in stock , then it won't be cheap to re-manufacture them , uh or it will be cheap sorry to re-manufacture them . 
UNKNOWN It's a bi i it's like a g it's a gadget , it's a selling point . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So do you reckon that's a good idea that , where's the remote , I'm here thing ? 
UNKNOWN I think that would be quite fun . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN I think the only I think the only pitfall that we would have would be how much it's going to cost if that means we have to cut down somewhere else , but I think pretty much we've used cheap relatively cheap and simple things . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah to s th well it's it's not as expensive as it would be if it was full colour 'cause if we've just got a black and white one , I mean they use them in calculators so . 
UNKNOWN The L_C_D_'s not cheap . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , okay . 
UNKNOWN Maybe we could start with the black and white . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN That that way we could upgrade later . 
UNKNOWN And you could yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , we talked about kinetic charging , we've deci seem to have decided on that , did we decide on double A_ or triple A_ batteries ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Well you cou um . 
UNKNOWN Do you want like a back-up ? 
UNKNOWN No , one of the decisions we had to make was whether we had double A_ or triple A_ batteries 'cause they've still got to be charged this way haven't they ? 
UNKNOWN K no the kinetic ones come come with um a sort of w watch a battery that goes in a watch . 
UNKNOWN I oh I see . 
UNKNOWN Right , okay , got you . 
UNKNOWN So it's a lot smaller , so it would Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Got you on that okay , didn't realise . 
UNKNOWN Um , okay so we've got battery . 
UNKNOWN The inside components is pretty standardised across the board isn't it ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So there's not a really a decision to be made there , um . 
UNKNOWN The buttons what did you give us as our The bare-board L_C_D_ or On the top one okay you've got the touch okay and then Okay , okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah the well I think were we're going for the L_C_D_ on that one , on the buttons , on the on the on on the top one we're gonna yeah . 
UNKNOWN On the bottom we were gonna have the rubber , the rubber ones , the anti-R_S_I_ ones . 
UNKNOWN Sorry could you repeat that last part ? 
UNKNOWN Um , okay on we've got the flip the flip-screen , the top one is gonna be the L_C_D_ and the bottom one is gonna be the rubberised buttons . 
UNKNOWN L_C_D_ screen . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN And for the sorry . 
UNKNOWN No , it's fine . 
UNKNOWN For the body design I think plastic , uh w yeah we could use the body , for the inside and uh rubber as a padding or for the grip , something like to add to the design . 
UNKNOWN Plastic , okay . 
UNKNOWN For the inside . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm , so we decided on a rubber casing for the plastic shell , a variety of designs, okay . 
UNKNOWN Plast right . 
UNKNOWN Oh I think so , I think so . 
UNKNOWN and it is just uh although it's rubberised and spongy , apart from that we're just going to go for sort of vegetable and fruit colours , we're not gonna try and make it actually a vegetable or fruit design or anything else , like a shell that we discussed , just go for the colours . 
UNKNOWN Mm no . 
UNKNOWN No I think I we don't wanna be tacky if we've got a kind of different shape anyway um the fact the m the material that we would be using would be cheap , so we could make it red , we could make it um psychedelic , you know , we could make it black and white zebra stripes , but that's not really what we're focusing on , what we're focusing on is the m you know yes . 
UNKNOWN It's Uh I it's different . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN The feel . 
UNKNOWN So we could just pick anything . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Is that going to be this image I've got in my head of something kind of shaped like that , maybe about that size , made of plastic , fits into the palm of the hand , rubberised cover that's spongy . 
UNKNOWN Is that really going to fit fancy look and feel which was the major thing that people wanted , market research , is that fancy ? 
UNKNOWN It's just different it's just different from everything else and I mean , I'm trying to imagine um clean looking houses , sort of beige and black um so you either want something that goes with that , which is what's on the market anyway , or you want something that contrasts as you know like you get clocks now that are more of a talking point than an actual clock because they're so interesting and Mm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I'm just kind of pushing at that to see if you came out with anything else , but I mean I totally agree . 
UNKNOWN We looked at those remotes , I mean they are kind of anonymous , very similar looking things . 
UNKNOWN This would definitely be different enough , I just wondered if anybody could come up with something even more Well the thing is the rubberised covers are going to be s relatively cheap to produce , that if in a year's time we we get feedback from the design fairs that show something else is coming I mean it's so easy for us to just produce that and it can be slipped on , which is another beauty of it . 
UNKNOWN And you would just have an across the b you would have so many different options that you could do , you could have um a plain black one , you could have sparkly pink glittery ones for your little Mm . 
UNKNOWN And ones tha ones that have rubbery spikes y you know , you could just go so far with it , like a puffer fish , you could just , you could take it wherever , so I think that's quite a flexible thing . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN You can you can just Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Acupressure , you could talk of acupressures . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And finally the body should be retouchable , may maybe ch you can change the body or the case casing the case outside , it should be moulded it with the design in such a way you can change it every time . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah j with these rubber these rubberised ca not the actual uh plastic outside case , just the rubber thing that goes round the outside . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN The rubber . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay we've got five minutes , um , or that might've been up for a while . 
UNKNOWN Mm , so can I just recap uh Sarah , for the decisions that we've made , kinetic charging , the watch-type batteries , um L_C_D_ display on th the top side of the flip top , rubberised buttons on the bottom side , we're gonna use fruit and vegetable colours for the rubber cover , the case itself is plastic . 
UNKNOWN Fine . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN That's how far we've got , what else do we have to add to our decisions here ? 
UNKNOWN Fine , uh we were talking of voice recognition also because that we are not for how to look it uh remote control if it's lost . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So , are we looking at voice ? 
UNKNOWN Yes , it was just , there was just a cost issue with that , but it's a good idea we just need to check on the cost , is that right ? 
UNKNOWN Or maybe like uh William was suggesting in the last thing some devices you put on key chains . 
UNKNOWN For l yeah , the whistle . 
UNKNOWN Oh yeah , yeah the whistle ones , yeah . 
UNKNOWN So we can if financially voice recognition is not feasible we could go for a whistle . 
UNKNOWN And incorporating the company logo ? 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN Have you Okay . 
UNKNOWN Uh sorry I didn't mention this , but we'll be incorporating in the design . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause I took it from the feedback you gave in the last meeting from y from y your report, it's not just a case of having a little R_R_ hidden somewhere , they do want it to be obvious that it's our product don't they ? 
UNKNOWN Well they do , but I think we can you could well it is , it is , I think you just address that with um advertising . 
UNKNOWN Since it's the only one of its kind on the market it's obviously gonna be ours . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um , you associate the name with the individual product that it is and that does the work for you . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Obviously it'll have a logo on it just like everything , but everything else has a logo on it . 
UNKNOWN The point is that it's got to stand out somehow differently but I think it does , without that so I'm not worried about that . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Did we I know at the last meeting we spoke about a beeper , I think that was you talked about a beeper for a location , have we just rejected that in favour of voice recognition then ? 
UNKNOWN Depending on how i I mean we've got this memo saying that it's something that the company's looking into , so um that seems to make sense , but if it turns out that it's hugely expensive we'd have to cut down somewhere else , then it's worth thinking about . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , depending on the expense of it . 
UNKNOWN And they've got in stock , so yeah . 
UNKNOWN But I think we'll find out more about cost afterwards . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Right I'm going to wrap it up there . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Fine . 
UNKNOWN I got a end meeting now message on my mo yeah so . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Did it ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Again a questionnaire huh ? 
UNKNOWN Um so I think we've probably got it says , closing we have forty minutes so I um think we've probably got about that time before we come back . 
UNKNOWN You got to go through . 
UNKNOWN It's either that or we only had forty minutes to discuss what we just discussed and don't know how long that took . 
UNKNOWN I think we are pretty going in a clear direction now . 
UNKNOWN Is everyone happy ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN If you leave them on the whole time you get to look like a noodle the whole time . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Is that someone's ? 
UNKNOWN Is that . 
THANKS Thank you . 
UNKNOWN three , apparently . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Okay , you all switched on . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Yep , me too . 
UNKNOWN I presume we're good to go . 
UNKNOWN Okay , um minutesum we decided to use a kinetic charger , standard chip , um 'cause it can come in various different sizes , it wasn't uh uh gonna be a problem factor . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN We wanted a stand-by function . 
UNKNOWN The case material is gonna be soft , rubbery , changeable . 
UNKNOWN Um buttons with a combination of L_C_D_ and rubber according to the design . 
UNKNOWN Um bright funky designsinspired by fruit , keeping with the hip kind of feel . 
UNKNOWN Um and to try and incorporate voice recognition software into our design until we can find out more about the cost of things like that . 
UNKNOWN Um and the rubber buttons that we'll use will be anti-R_S_I_ . 
UNKNOWN Okay ? 
UNKNOWN Prototype presentation. 
UNKNOWN I think that would be you . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Me and William worked on a prototype , and I think William is going to make a p presentationon that . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , shall I show ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I'll show . 
UNKNOWN Though do you do you wanna do you wanna sh do you wanna hold it and I'll I'll show you the presentation. 
UNKNOWN Make sure the camera's Yes , yes you can . 
UNKNOWN I can hold it like Yeah , so It looks crazy . 
UNKNOWN Can I just nick your Whoa . 
UNKNOWN Wait a second , I'll get it out . 
UNKNOWN Um Okay . 
UNKNOWN Going a bit crazy over here . 
THANKS Thank you . 
UNKNOWN You should have one of those things and you can just take it off . 
UNKNOWN Um not now . 
SURPRISE Oh .
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Ta-da . 
UNKNOWN Oh , where are the hinges ? 
UNKNOWN Okay , so this is our look and feel presentation, the final our final presentation. 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Mm 'kay . 
UNKNOWN And we'll first look at the exterior of what we've uh come up with over there . 
UNKNOWN Um It's gonna have a a plastic body um with a sort of standard colour , either we're thinking some something fairly neutral like a a white or a light blue or something . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN You able to look ? 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN This is underneath the rubberised the rubberised uh outer casing um which there'd be sort of a wide choice they would be attached , but we can we can come up with that . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um the um wide choice of colours and sort of patterns , so you've got you've got a lot of customisation with it . 
UNKNOWN Um it's obviously an a sort of clam-shell design and uh the um the top L_C_D_ screen that you can see that would b would be sort of um how do you say , it's yeah yeah , it would be sort of inset into the into the top and the buttons at the bottom would d so so it'll fully close flat . 
UNKNOWN . 
UNKNOWN The black and white touch screen wherein people can Right . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN So it's flush . 
UNKNOWN Oh right , okay , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah . 
UNKNOWN And working on the inside we've um already said d decided on the kinetic batteries , which actually , thinking about it now , could y could also probably attach to the flipping open and shut as well , so that you could probably get a bit of Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So put it in the top section rather than the bottom sections , 'cause it's the top part that's okay . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um we decided that um the voice recognition system , it did actually say on the emailthat they were sort of coming in and they were fairly easy to get a-hold of , so we presumed that they'd also be quite cheap . 
UNKNOWN So you'd have something like where you'd shout out , where where is the remote and it'll shout back , I'm here , or something . 
UNKNOWN And then yeah . 
UNKNOWN Or something . 
UNKNOWN It wo it won't shout out I'm here or something . 
UNKNOWN It'll just shout out I'm here , or something to similar effect . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN I'm under the sofa . 
UNKNOWN Ah oka Infrared could be here also . 
UNKNOWN Or , that would be too complicated . 
UNKNOWN Uh yeah , if it was going like I d well tha that could be something for next time , maybe . 
UNKNOWN You can have a remote that tells you exactly where it is . 
UNKNOWN Um the standard , there's be a standard transmission with the T_V_ using using all the standard chips that we've talked about . 
UNKNOWN Infrared . 
UNKNOWN Um it would it would have obviously 'cause it's split over two two different layers , it would need two separate P_C_B_s , so it would be joined at the hinge through some sort of cabling . 
UNKNOWN And uh because , obviously , all T_V_s use this , the same infrared medium , we'd just be using using the same thing to transmit the data . 
UNKNOWN And the infrared um sender would be on the on one of the bot the bottom layer , just at the front of the we haven't I don't think we actually put it on . 
UNKNOWN Like here . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah , something like that . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Actually , no , it would be it would have to be on the on the front . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , on the front on the front side of that , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , here . 
UNKNOWN . 
UNKNOWN Oh right , yeah , okay , yeah , I've got you . 
UNKNOWN So when it's even if it's open here , the signals would go . 
UNKNOWN It's still pointing , yes . 
UNKNOWN So when you've actually got it open , it would be facing the T_V_ . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that would make sense . 
UNKNOWN And then finally um on to the interface . 
UNKNOWN The top screen , as we said , is would be an inset um black and white L_C_D_ s touch screen which yeah would uh have all of all of the the available functions for for the remote on it , uh whereas the bot the bottom screen would just contain the standard buttons , like the vo volume up and down , channel up and down , power on and off , and uh things to that effect . 
UNKNOWN This one right here . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN . 
UNKNOWN And now we've we also decided on the inside , we could possibly either have um some some kind of sort of bezzled uh logo on it , or something inset , or maybe an engraving of the logo on the top . 
UNKNOWN Which is No . 
UNKNOWN But not interfering with the outside kind of look of the product once it's Okay . 
UNKNOWN No d not not actually . 
UNKNOWN No , not uh interfering with l the whole look of the the product when it's uh on the thing . 
UNKNOWN Look up to it . 
UNKNOWN And finally that's how we put the fashion back into electronics , as that is that's the company logo . 
THANKS Thank you very much . 
UNKNOWN Yay . 
UNKNOWN Wrapping it all up , okay . 
UNKNOWN Well done . 
UNKNOWN Um I've now got evaluation criteria . 
UNKNOWN Certainly . 
UNKNOWN So this is the one . 
UNKNOWN Sorry . 
UNKNOWN It's to be presented . 
UNKNOWN There you go . 
UNKNOWN Logged in ? 
THANKS Thank you . 
UNKNOWN Oops . 
UNKNOWN . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Evaluation . 
UNKNOWN . 
UNKNOWN Mm um I I think this is chip . 
UNKNOWN It's quite similar to what it was before , though . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Sorry . 
UNKNOWN This stage of the evaluation is really for us as a team to evaluate if we have now got a product specification and prototype design that meets the the criteria that we got from our market research . 
UNKNOWN So this is the first stage of the evaluation . 
UNKNOWN Now , the collection of the criteria , as we saw in our previous meeting , was based on the user requirements and trends found in the marketing reports and marketing strategy of our company . 
UNKNOWN So it's what we've discussed in the last meeting , are we actually meeting those trends and requirements ? 
UNKNOWN Now the findings that we came up with , just a recap , are here . 
UNKNOWN The criteria that we want in this remote control are a fancy look and feel , technological innovation , it should be easy to use , it should incorporate current fashion trends , and those the two main ones , they were the spongy texture and the fruit and vegetable strong design colours . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN The design should minimise R_S_I_ and be easy to locate and we were still um uh slightly ambivalent as to whether to use voice recognition there , though that did seem to be the favoured strategy , but there was also , on the sideline , the though of maybe having a beeper function . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so we can come back to that slide, if you don't have a note of those . 
UNKNOWN I'll just show you how we're going to evaluate our own feedback to this , to what we have so far . 
UNKNOWN We're going to use a seven point scale , where one is true and seven is false . 
UNKNOWN We look at each of those criteria that I've just mentioned , I'll call that slideback up , and I will just do a preliminary rating of all those criteria on the whiteboard here . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Does that seem clear ? 
UNKNOWN Any questions there ? 
UNKNOWN Ah , it's perfect . 
UNKNOWN So we're going to look at these crite Yes , we're going to come to w we'll discuss each one and we'll come to a consensus rating between one and seven . 
UNKNOWN Is it everybody is going to evaluate , or just the Market okay . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Is that okay ? 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN One is true , seven is false . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN So I won't write all of that out again . 
UNKNOWN It will just be criteria one , two , three , four , five , six , or A_ , B_ , C_ , D_ , E_ , F_ to confuse it with the number rating . 
UNKNOWN B_ , C_ , D_ , E_ , F_ . 
UNKNOWN This is where I realise how tiny I actually am . 
UNKNOWN Just write small . 
UNKNOWN Criteria and rating . 
UNKNOWN Actually , it might be an idea , if we each did give our own individual rating , and we could take an average at the end . 
UNKNOWN How about that ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , so you can 'Kay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , okay . 
UNKNOWN That works . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So I'll just separate the ratings by obliques , and if we go one , two , three , four , we know who's who . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Criteria A_ , the fancy look and feel . 
UNKNOWN How do we feel about this prototype model relating to fancy it is a fancy look and feel . 
UNKNOWN One is true , seven is false . 
UNKNOWN My own rating for that would be a two . 
UNKNOWN One is true and seven is false . 
UNKNOWN I would agree . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I'd uh yeah I'd probably put it uh two yeah , two or three . 
UNKNOWN I'll just go this way . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Two . 
UNKNOWN No , three . 
UNKNOWN Three . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN I would say two . 
UNKNOWN Two . 
UNKNOWN I would say four . 
UNKNOWN A four , okay . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Adding those up , we've got a six and a five , eleven divided by four is what ? 
UNKNOWN Uh two and three quarters , it that right . 
UNKNOWN Mm yeah . 
UNKNOWN Almost three . 
UNKNOWN Two and three quarters ? 
UNKNOWN I think yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Two point seven five , there we go . 
UNKNOWN Okay , criteria B_ , criterion B_ , technologically innovative . 
UNKNOWN I would give that a three . 
UNKNOWN I'd give it a one . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Not that you're biased in that it the designer . 
UNKNOWN No , no , not at all . 
UNKNOWN A two . 
UNKNOWN Oh sorry , I I got it wrong . 
UNKNOWN The first one rating , I'm sorry . 
UNKNOWN Can you just make it two ? 
UNKNOWN The average oh , for you ? 
UNKNOWN The first . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I I just it the other way . 
UNKNOWN You want your rating to be a two ? 
UNKNOWN Uh in Yep , I just got two point f One is a , seven is false , okay . 
UNKNOWN Is that what you're saying ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So , I'll work out the average for that again at the end . 
UNKNOWN It's a very slightly altered Okay , and we're just waiting for your rating f Two point five , okay . 
UNKNOWN It's just two point five for that one . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Losing one decimal place , that's okay . 
UNKNOWN So what are you rating for this one , Paw ? 
UNKNOWN Two . 
UNKNOWN Two , okay . 
UNKNOWN So that is eight . 
UNKNOWN That brings it down to two , nice and simple , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Two . 
UNKNOWN Okay , ease of use . 
UNKNOWN Easy to use ? 
UNKNOWN Based on what you've said there , I would say a one , true . 
UNKNOWN Two . 
UNKNOWN Two . 
UNKNOWN I would say a two . 
UNKNOWN A two , okay . 
UNKNOWN I would say a two . 
UNKNOWN Two . 
UNKNOWN Two . 
UNKNOWN I should've said a two to make the arithmetic easy , shouldn't I ? 
UNKNOWN We'll just put almost two , because I'm not gonna get into silly decimal places . 
UNKNOWN One point seven f five . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay , mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Or we or if we want to really bring it down , we can do later . 
UNKNOWN Um mm now we're looking at it incorporates current fashion trends , now that's particularly in relation to our market research findings about the spongy texture to the exterior and the fruit and vegetable design colours . 
UNKNOWN D_ . 
UNKNOWN One . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN So I'm just thinking , before I give it my rating , you were limited in the use of materials for your prototype here . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's No , no , the the base colour was um white or or like or l sort of a light blue , but the changeable fa faces would uh allow you to get any basically any one of a number of colours that uh th it's full sort of customised . 
UNKNOWN Is this actually going to be the colours that you would use ? 
UNKNOWN White . 
UNKNOWN With for the plastic ? 
UNKNOWN Uh blue . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Any Right . 
UNKNOWN So we could use any strong fruit and veg colours and that's what we're intending to do . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah , yeah and No , no , 'cause th that's that's the the spongy feel would be in the rubber that you put round it , that otherwise it's just sort of hard plastic . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN And the spongy feel is no problem with that . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , because you'll be having a Because of the rubber case . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN In that case it's got to be a one for me . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I'll give it a one as well . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN Everybody ? 
UNKNOWN One . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN One . 
UNKNOWN That part was nice and easy . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Uh moving on to does the design minimise repetitive strain injury . 
UNKNOWN I don't think we've really touched on that a lot . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN We've we've discussed it , we haven't really come up with anything that we felt could feasibly reduce that . 
UNKNOWN We've talked about pointers , but the very use of a remote control , if you're someone who's zapping , who's sitting like that , and we found so many people did , how do you minimise that on such a small device ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well the type of button that we're gonna use in the bottom half , the material , minimises R_S_I_ it's meant to . 
UNKNOWN It's meant to be . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um maybe because it's slightl with the size that we've got it's quite small , but with the amount of stuff we're putting on it isn't that much . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN So maybe because there's more space , it's not kind of moving around trying to hit accurately the buttons in between . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN It's quite obvious just big buttons . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Um Four . 
UNKNOWN I think I'm gonna have to be neutral on that and give it a four . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I'd uh I'd f I'd go for a five , actually , 'cause Yep . 
UNKNOWN A five , okay . 
UNKNOWN Four and a four okay . 
UNKNOWN Four . 
UNKNOWN Twenty one is that twenty one ? 
UNKNOWN So that's four point two five . 
UNKNOWN And finally , last but not least , easy to locate . 
UNKNOWN Now we talked about voice recognition , we talked about a beeper , have we really have the designers come to any dec real decision on that ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , it was it was uh a voice voice recognition , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Voice r recognition . 
UNKNOWN It was the I'm here thing , yep . 
UNKNOWN And are we happy with the costs on that ? 
UNKNOWN That is going to be feasible , cost-wise . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah , that yeah , that's feasible . 
UNKNOWN That sounds good then . 
UNKNOWN I'd go for a I ca we can adjust the volume on that , just as we could volume on T_V_ . 
UNKNOWN Um I think it would r I think it would probably be a a stand it would be a stand it would be quite loud . 
UNKNOWN So if sombody's in the other room or if T_V_s in different rooms , or . 
UNKNOWN A standard . 
UNKNOWN It would be . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So it would be s p yeah . 
UNKNOWN You built into the feature . 
UNKNOWN And if you didn't hear it in the room that you were standing in , then you'd realise that it wasn't in that room , you'd go into another room . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Logical . 
UNKNOWN That's a one for me . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , one . 
UNKNOWN One and one , good . 
UNKNOWN One . 
UNKNOWN I do realise that we might be being fairly biased , 'cause it is our product , but W I thin yeah , I think yeah . 
UNKNOWN So , how do we feel about this ? 
UNKNOWN We've got our our we've got the highest rating of meeting the specifications that is definitely true for two of the uh six criteria there . 
UNKNOWN That is for um incorporates current fashion trends and is easy to locate . 
UNKNOWN The lowest rating we've got , which is really n it's not terribly low , i it's close around neutral is for uh the minimisation of repetitive strain injury . 
UNKNOWN Do we feel on the basis of tha of these evaluation findings that we can go ahead and now produce this as a prototype and market it , or do we have to make further modifications ? 
UNKNOWN I don't think so . 
UNKNOWN We happy to go ahead ? 
UNKNOWN I think we yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think we're set . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think for most of those ratings that it's high enough at the upper end of the scale for us to go ahead with that , and I really doubt if on the basis of current technology and our current capabilities , we could actually do much more to minimise that . 
UNKNOWN Do much apart from having a huge big Don't think so . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN I know . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Well , I hope that's uh clear to the team . 
UNKNOWN Is there anything you would like to to ask me about the findings before I sum up ? 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN Good . 
UNKNOWN Fine then . 
UNKNOWN I'll just leave it there . 
UNKNOWN Oops . 
CONFIRMATION Okay , thank you . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Okay , I've got finance here now . 
UNKNOWN I'm gonna plug this in so you can all see it , if that's okay . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Oh yes . 
UNKNOWN You want me to b unplug that ? 
UNKNOWN That's all . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
CONFIRMATION Thanks . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Now I presume that the screen will go blank , that um Okay . 
UNKNOWN We just type numbers into this and we come out with the final value . 
UNKNOWN So are we still on for kinetic ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN See , it woulda been handy to have this at the beginning . 
UNKNOWN Um it might have influenced our choice . 
UNKNOWN Right , what's happening with the electronics ? 
UNKNOWN It was a regular chip on printand Oh , no , no , no , the um Yeah , it's you you've put in three for the number of kinetic cells , there should just be one . 
UNKNOWN Chip on print. 
UNKNOWN Double-curved . 
UNKNOWN In the top , it's the number of c yeah . 
UNKNOWN Oh , right , okay . 
CONFIRMATION Thanks . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , and yeah , just a no , one reg v uh Yeah , one of them and one sample sensor and sample speaker . 
UNKNOWN So , would there be two ? 
UNKNOWN One chip . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN And they're double curved . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN Y Two , 'cause it's two . 
UNKNOWN Single-curved . 
UNKNOWN One double curve . 
UNKNOWN Two curves , yeah . 
UNKNOWN But it has a slightly flattened bottom so it can sit . 
UNKNOWN So it can rest . 
UNKNOWN So what's a single curve then ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I'd say I'd say it was w yeah , I think I think it's One double-curved . 
UNKNOWN It would just be a flat bottom with one curve . 
UNKNOWN like a domed thing . 
UNKNOWN So just one double Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Single-cu . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN And one no , 'cause one yeah , one's double-curved , and then the other one's a plastic . 
UNKNOWN Um Mm . 
UNKNOWN Plastic and rubber . 
UNKNOWN The other curves at the sides , but it's slightly flattened at the bottom so it doesn't roll over . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um we've got plastic and rubber , haven't we ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Plastic one and maybe rubber point five . 
UNKNOWN And special colour . 
UNKNOWN . 
UNKNOWN No I think rubber , since it's being used just as a casing , we can put point five . 
UNKNOWN Um Do you think ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , because there are I think it allows the point five , yeah . 
UNKNOWN We can use that . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN What does it mean if you put point five for that ? 
UNKNOWN It means we are not using a lot of rubber actually . 
UNKNOWN We're using just a very low quantity of rubber compared to plastic . 
UNKNOWN It would be like saying we're using See , it says case material . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So we're not actually using plastic in the case , are we ? 
UNKNOWN No , no , that's it's as an extra . 
UNKNOWN It's including , it's including . 
UNKNOWN Right , okay . 
UNKNOWN So that shouldn't that shouldn't be actually on there , because that's not incorporated in the cost of the remote you get . 
UNKNOWN But it is gonna be part of the total cost , and there's nowhere else we can we can put that in , is there ? 
UNKNOWN There's nowhere else we can code for the the rubber used in the casing . 
UNKNOWN So do we not have to account for it in the cost somewhere there ? 
UNKNOWN Okay , we'll just put it in as we'll put in as half . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Or sh we should just put it in as one , because the plastic is zero anyway . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , okay . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN No , we don't step on anyone's toes . 
UNKNOWN Okay , special colour , do we need that ? 
UNKNOWN Might do , if we go for some of the more exotic aubergines and such like colours . 
UNKNOWN N yeah , okay . 
UNKNOWN Interface . 
UNKNOWN Push-button . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , the push-button's one and L_C_ display one . 
UNKNOWN One . 
UNKNOWN An One . 
UNKNOWN And buttons Well yes . 
UNKNOWN Buttons Has that not gone up ? 
UNKNOWN S Has that not made any d if you click off that square now , has that not made any difference ? 
UNKNOWN I think we could change the battery also . 
UNKNOWN Instead of going for kinetic how about going for a standard battery . 
UNKNOWN Is it oh , it's brought it slightly down . 
UNKNOWN Oh no , it was seven five it's changed not a lot . 
UNKNOWN So is is uncurved completely and just actually making the rubber case the curved thing , is that going to make a difference ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uncurved , flat . 
UNKNOWN Oh , it's not made any difference , has it? . 
UNKNOWN No , we'll have No , no , you've got to click off to calculate it again . 
UNKNOWN It's gone up again . 
UNKNOWN No , it just surprises one . 
UNKNOWN Oh , it's not calculated it . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN Okay , there we go . 
UNKNOWN It's brought it down slightly . 
UNKNOWN C it might uh you might you might be assuming that that is in Euros . 
UNKNOWN It's not a lot though . 
UNKNOWN . 
UNKNOWN It could be in Dollars . 
UNKNOWN And then it would be fine , because the exchange range would make it about twelve . 
UNKNOWN Is there anything on the menu No . 
UNKNOWN We haven't been dealin we haven't been dealing with dollars though , I think Okay , so the highest we've got is the electronics here . 
UNKNOWN I don't think so . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN Ri I think it's in Euro . 
UNKNOWN Um and the interface . 
UNKNOWN If we tr um . 
UNKNOWN If we moved away from our much loved idea of a kinetic battery and just went with the standard batteries , would that make a huge difference ? 
UNKNOWN And going to a regular bat Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , the standard , it um it would make one difference . 
UNKNOWN The biggest one would be taking away if you took away If you to Yeah . 
UNKNOWN What I feel is , customers never said anything about the battery . 
UNKNOWN It's internal , nobody looks into the battery . 
UNKNOWN But shape and colours , that's something we shouldn't comprimi Where's that special form ? 
UNKNOWN And people are used to buying batteries , they're not gonna say I'm not getting this , 'cause I've got to buy a battery for a remote control . 
UNKNOWN If if you take away the voice , I I do I don't like to say it , but if you take away the voice recognition , then you've got it . 
UNKNOWN Mm mm mm . 
UNKNOWN Should we see what difference it makes ? 
UNKNOWN Where's the where's the voice recognition ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah i yeah . 
UNKNOWN No 'cause it's samples sens sample speaker . 
UNKNOWN Um Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Right , okay . 
UNKNOWN If you took away that , that'll make it twelve point three five . 
UNKNOWN Well the kinetic is three . 
UNKNOWN If we change it to the battery it's that's minus three . 
UNKNOWN They n n yeah , but you p minus three plus two . 
UNKNOWN Oh , right . 
UNKNOWN I keep seeing zero . 
UNKNOWN Um We can do it some other way , we can do it doesn't have to be voice recognition . 
UNKNOWN We could do the voice recognition for , you know , business class or something , you know , like an upgraded version . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Sure . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN You could choose to have that or not . 
UNKNOWN But they but I mean in I don't see why we have to sell it for twenty five Euros now , because they w they were saying they were quite willing to pay more for better product . 
UNKNOWN But we're still working to um head o We can put in our recommendations . 
UNKNOWN So should we just change the design specification then ? 
UNKNOWN Make it costly . 
UNKNOWN If we if we're working to head office specifications as this is what this project team's working for , we can put in our recommendations for what we've we've found and what we the consensus that we've come to as a result of the meetings . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN We c we could s Yeah , we could say Yeah , I s And then say we recommend Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But we need to work to that specification to start with . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN And I think the voice recognition sounds wonderful , but our object is so distinctive that that in itself is gonna make it easier to locate as a f you know in a first instance . 
UNKNOWN Um as you say , we can offer the voice recognition initially to business class customers and so Mm . 
UNKNOWN Okay , we can make the price fit , and then say if we'd had our budget , we would've had this , because it also sets it apart from the crowd . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause we've done all the background work to go for that if they want it . 
UNKNOWN They like their gadgets , they like something that's completely different . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It's s something completely different associated with your company . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Right , okay , so It's two point five . 
UNKNOWN So if we take voice recognition out we are . 
UNKNOWN That'll do it . 
UNKNOWN Twelve point three five . 
UNKNOWN Yeah we are close to the budget . 
UNKNOWN Is it twelve point fif was it twelve point fifty ? 
UNKNOWN Two five . 
UNKNOWN No , it's twelve point two five . 
UNKNOWN Are you sure ? 
UNKNOWN Sorry , not meaning to doubt your words there . 
UNKNOWN Yeah well two , twelve point two five times two is twenty five , isn't it ? 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Are they really going to quibble about ten P_ ? 
UNKNOWN It's twelve point five maybe , then . 
UNKNOWN Or point zero one of a Euro ? 
UNKNOWN Which is less than ten P_ . 
UNKNOWN I don't know what it said fifty percent of the cost . 
UNKNOWN So half of the price would be I think it is the first one . 
UNKNOWN I think the agendaone was where the um price was , wasn't it ? 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN That's today's kick off meeting , . 
UNKNOWN Twelve point five . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Ah . 
UNKNOWN So we are under the budget . 
UNKNOWN I thought that's what it was . 
UNKNOWN Well done , people . 
UNKNOWN So we're okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So is that uh got us covered for the electronics then ? 
UNKNOWN We don't need something else to take that place ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
NEGATION No . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause that that was just a bought-on extra , you could just take that out and that would be fine , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Seems fine . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I think that's brilliant . 
UNKNOWN Except voice recognition , everything is Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Right , so we've done that . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Product evaluation . 
UNKNOWN We've done room for creativity , haven't we ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Because we've got decisions that we would have made that we weren't didn't feel able to make . 
UNKNOWN Um I presume we discussed leadership and teamwork . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN um in the sense that um did you feel like a team ? 
UNKNOWN Or did you feel like uh autonomy ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I'd say , as a team . 
UNKNOWN Although we had our separate tasks , there was so much interaction , so much that we needed to um bounce off each other . 
UNKNOWN I think we had a nice time . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Find out from each other , yeah . 
UNKNOWN And I've certainly felt heard , listened to in that in relevant areas we've been able to , you know , give and take and adjust our remit where necessary . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I think there was uh very constructive feedback by everybody . 
UNKNOWN It's not like people trying to cut each other . 
UNKNOWN There is more of uh true cohesive teamwork . 
UNKNOWN We came to a very predic creative design , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , and uh Yeah , I think . 
UNKNOWN And Sarah , you coordinated the work very well . 
THANKS Thank you . 
UNKNOWN How did you find it ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , no , I thought it it went really well and I yeah , I I feel that everyone was listened to and all the points that were raised seem to have been sorted out , although we didn't quite make the voice recognition in there , but that's that's good . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think it would have made it into the final product if it was actually if if if we'd seen the marketing before the initial specification was put out , I think maybe it would've come out a d little different , but yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I liked the fact that we could say an idea and it'd be suggested that that wasn't the best idea , but no one felt like shot down , you know , y it didn't matter it saying what you thought , because if it wasn't something that was that relevant , then it didn't matter , 'cause it was just another idea in the field . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN I like that . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um teamwork . 
UNKNOWN Well you two created that wonderful specimen of a Play-Doh model . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , well . 
UNKNOWN I think that was the best part of the 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN Um uh I'm still not caught up . 
UNKNOWN But that's nothing to do with the teamwork at all . 
UNKNOWN Um Maybe . 
UNKNOWN Maybe we should think of branching out into children's toys and fake mobile phones as a side line . 
UNKNOWN And fake R_C_s . 
UNKNOWN No , that was quite fun . 
UNKNOWN Um means , whiteboard , digital pens , etcetera , what does that mean ? 
UNKNOWN Any ideas ? 
UNKNOWN How do we evaluate the materials we had for communicating and sharing information ? 
UNKNOWN Discuss which ones yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Could it've been better , was it adequate ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I think I think we probably woulda used the outer emailsystem more , had we actually had had more time and if we'd been separated more . 
UNKNOWN Had time to kind of Yeah , 'cause we could just sort of say , sorry what did you say about that or what do you think about that , rather than having to emailit , yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But it was nice having it there . 
UNKNOWN Um like the whole picture of the thing . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , moving around the room . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But I think it's good , like uh we spent times individually . 
UNKNOWN I never thought of a remote control with a flip top . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I think it's new ideas in general , rather than Mm . 
UNKNOWN It's really borrowing from other areas , it's , you know , bringing things from other areas in , it so it's I mean nothing is new , but it's applying it to a d in a different area . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Vegetables . 
UNKNOWN That's mine . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , no . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , it's The thing is Yep , sorry , go on Sarah . 
UNKNOWN Well they have to come from somewhere , don't they ? 
UNKNOWN Absolutely , yeah . 
UNKNOWN And as sh as w sorry , you go . 
UNKNOWN Um as was shown by your presentationwith all of the other controls , remote controls , no one's thought about it particularly . 
NEGATION No . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN I mean they're slightly different , so if someone's been shut in the room and said make ours a bit different from everyone else's , 'cause it's w something we should think about , but obviously no one's put any great deal of thought into it . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I do I don't think the the companies are really concerned . 
UNKNOWN They're just like we've got a D_V_D_ player , does anyone remember the remote control ? 
UNKNOWN Can't you get the one that we used for the last one ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , just jazz it up a bit . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Uh d they don't really think about it , because normally , the remote control isn't the product which they're trying to ship . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN They're trying to ship the D_V_D_ player , the video player , the T_V_ . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , the focus isn't on to that , yeah . 
UNKNOWN But then when it everything is really smart , and you've just got this big chunk of black thing sitting on your coffee table , it doesn't go , I mean if you could have something that's a proper funky thing , a funky item that's individual , individual to you , I mean they could even go into um you go in with an idea and they design it on Photoshop and then they just get it printed on the plastic , you would pray you would pay a lot extra , because it's individually being a plastic was being made for you . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
NEGATION No . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But people could have anything that they wanted . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Surprising to me is like uh people give a lot of attention to modifying mobile phones , like a real want to see a new launch or something like that . 
UNKNOWN Because of the produ Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And new f television products coming up , but nobody giving uh much idea to this . 
UNKNOWN I think it's really good that this has been very market research based , because just going back to mobile phones , I mean this is the first change in remote control devices that I can really , you know , say is is obvious and visible . 
UNKNOWN Like Sarah was telling , everything's Right . 
UNKNOWN We see it in mobile phones a lot , and tha that's where we've borrowed a lot of our ide our ideas from . 
UNKNOWN There are innovations in that that people don't really want . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN I see people wanting a model of the phone they were really happy with , and they can't get it anymore and it's innovation for innovation's sake , and I think it's wonderful our company's so R_ and D_ based . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well , it's innovation for money's sake . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN The the people have to keep buying . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But forcing it onto people , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It's things that , you know , they might want to buy the thing they really want . 
UNKNOWN And you can't get you've got your handset that works fine , but you can't get the battery anymore for that type of phone , because the phones have moved on , things like that . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Or there isn't a cover to fit it or whatever , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN It's madness . 
UNKNOWN Um In closing There we go . 
UNKNOWN See I think I think it was just the produc uh just the production cost of the phone . 
UNKNOWN Um our costs are below budget with recommendations that they the budget be increased , but I think I don't know , d what do you think ? 
UNKNOWN Do you think that's takes into account um overheads like us being well paid kind of a thing ? 
UNKNOWN And the heating for the building , do you think our budget includes everything , all the costs that are going out ? 
UNKNOWN Well . 
UNKNOWN I think that was just the the physical . 
UNKNOWN So it looks well it looks like it's gonna be fifty percent profit , you've still got all of the overheads to come out of that . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So maybe increasing it , you would also have to increase the price that it's sold at . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Maybe fifty percent more . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I think yeah I don't from the market research . 
UNKNOWN But I think but you were saying that that's quite Hmm . 
UNKNOWN But I think in the remit that we were given , it was very specific . 
UNKNOWN I think we've done what we were required to do , and I think there'll have to be another project team or a new project for us to look at at those kind of things . 
UNKNOWN I don't think that's something we have to look at and find a way of raising the cash for . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , it was I it's top secret . 
UNKNOWN I think we've done very well to get within budget and it still makes such an innovative item that I think people are really gonna want . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It's a shame it won't ever get made . 
UNKNOWN I know . 
UNKNOWN Maybe it will . 
UNKNOWN Maybe it will . 
UNKNOWN Who knows ? 
UNKNOWN Maybe they are gonna steal our ideas and sell it . 
UNKNOWN Maybe someone'll r run down and patent it . 
UNKNOWN Um it's it is it's a conspiracy going on here . 
UNKNOWN Um the project has been evaluated well and truly . 
UNKNOWN That's what it is . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um and we've got the meeting survey and questionnaire . 
UNKNOWN There's a final questionnaire . 
UNKNOWN Oh , so we've got about fifty minutes to catch up with everything that I fell behind with , so I'll be delegating in my um role as Project Supervisor , so good luck . 
UNKNOWN In your yeah . 
UNKNOWN Celebration , you didn't talk about that . 
UNKNOWN I think the celebration is the twenty five pounds . 
UNKNOWN Either that or we'll be dancing on the desks . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN Questionnaire . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Is that it then ? 
UNKNOWN Um yeah , just the last , I think . 
UNKNOWN Awesome . 
UNKNOWN I think I've got minutesfor two of the meeting and the last thingy . 
UNKNOWN Questionnaire done . 
UNKNOWN Oh , I didn't have to rate you on how much you influenced the meeting this time . 
UNKNOWN Was that not the questionnaire for the how you felt you'd done in your thing ? 
UNKNOWN Oh , right . 
UNKNOWN But do we not sometimes evaluate in these meetings too ? 
UNKNOWN I don't think . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , the the s yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think yeah , questionnaire seven was the one I did just before the meeting . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN I just got con Is that for us ? 
UNKNOWN Uh , making a profit of fifty million Euros . 
UNKNOWN Alright so twenty five . 
UNKNOWN Mm 'kay . 
UNKNOWN So , it's go gonna have to be be pretty damn trendy . 
UNKNOWN So yeah , I've The only the only remote controls I've used usually come with the television , and they're fairly basic . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So uh Mm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I was thinking that as well , I think the the only ones that I've seen that you buy are the sort of one for all type things where they're , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah the universal ones . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So presumably that might be an idea to put into . 
UNKNOWN But but to sell it for twenty five you need a lot of neat features . 
UNKNOWN Slim . 
UNKNOWN For sure . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh 'cause I mean , what uh twenty five Euros , that's about I dunno , fifteen Pounds or so ? 
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm , it's about that . 
UNKNOWN And that's quite a lot for a remote control . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Um well my first thoughts would be most remote controls are grey or black . 
UNKNOWN As you said they come with the T_V_ so it's normally just your basic grey black remote control functions , so maybe we could think about colour ? 
UNKNOWN Uh-huh . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Make that might make it a bit different from the rest at least . 
UNKNOWN Um , and as you say , we need to have some kind of gimmick , so um I thought maybe something like if you lose it and you can whistle , you know those things ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN The the keyrings , yeah yeah . 
UNKNOWN Because we always lose our remote control . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Okay , that's cool . 
UNKNOWN Uh yeah uh , being as a Marketing Exper Expert I will like to say like before deciding the cost of this remote control or any other things we must see the market potential for this product like what is the competition in the market ? 
UNKNOWN What are the available prices of the other remote controls in the prices ? 
UNKNOWN What speciality other remote controls are having and how complicated it is to use these remote controls as compared to other remote controls available in the market . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So before deciding or before finalising this project , we must discuss all these things , like and apart from this , it should be having a good look also , because people really li uh like to play with it when they are watching movies or playing with or playing with their C_D_ player , M_P_ three player like any electronic devices . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN They really want to have something good , having a good design in their hands , so , yes , all this . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN Uh , what do we think a What do we think a good size would be for this ? 
UNKNOWN So , we're looking for 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN We're Sorry , carry on . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause I I know as you add more buttons to the remote it sometimes gets so big and clunky and there's just like a hundred buttons on it , or you could have a really small slim one but then you could lose it easily . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Then you lose it , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Kind of um , maybe more like a P_D_A_ kind of , just hand held , like , 'cause Yeah . 
UNKNOWN For for uh remember we're trying to make it for twelve Euros fifty . 
UNKNOWN No , I wasn't , no sorry I wasn't thinking of the screen of like a P_D_A_ but Okay . 
UNKNOWN Okay well right we'll have to um I'll we're k having another meeting in half an hour so um we should all look into a bit uh , oh actually , no , we'll allocate . 
UNKNOWN So you do the looking around at other remote controls . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um , if you could maybe come up with sort of shapes and suggested shades or whatever , and you could look into um basically how how it's made I_E_ like how you make it all in one , how what sort of materials are available to you whatever . 
UNKNOWN And obviously , other instructions will come from the personal coach . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Which will probably just usurp what I said so Shapes and colours and um basically how to make it attractive . 
UNKNOWN So you want me to look at shapes and everything you said ? 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFUSION Uh . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN And you look at competition and design . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
CONFIRMATION Cool . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So we have uh Um . 
UNKNOWN Wait for emails ? 
CONFUSION Uh . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Okay , groovy . 
UNKNOWN And no doubt we'll get um Sorry . 
UNKNOWN Oh no , . 
UNKNOWN Sorry it's okay . 
UNKNOWN We'll get um warnings for next meetings as well . 
CONFIRMATION Okay , cool . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN I shall I can't imagine these are worth much . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Fashion into electronic . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um minutesfrom the last meeting which were essentially that we uh had decided on roles for each of you , however , um there are some changes that I've got from on high that um are a bit uh well w what I didn't actually realise it was that the uh this is for a specific television . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So the all in one idea goes out the window . 
UNKNOWN And they require that the uh actually I'll get to that at the end point number four , um we'll get what you've got and then we can see what we can adapt from it . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So um , presentations, were you anybody got , raring to go ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Raring to go ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Good stuff . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Oh I need to plug you in . 
UNKNOWN So how S Sh do you want me to hold it ? 
UNKNOWN Wow . 
UNKNOWN Just about . 
UNKNOWN It's a inspired design . 
UNKNOWN Uh there we go , just screw 'em on in . 
UNKNOWN Gonna have to swap them round so now , it was function F_ eight . 
UNKNOWN So , after that ? 
UNKNOWN F_ eight . 
UNKNOWN That's the wee blue one . 
UNKNOWN f oh sorry F_ eight . 
UNKNOWN Blue one F_ eight . 
UNKNOWN Should do it , good one . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh , me again , Rajan the Marketing Expert . 
UNKNOWN Uh , as we have decided in the last meeting that I have to find out , sorry , yeah sure . 
UNKNOWN Hold on , sorry . 
UNKNOWN and if you just click that it'll go ahead , one at a time . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh actually , sorry I have to see the other , sorry . 
UNKNOWN Sorry , uh . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , thank you . 
UNKNOWN Uh , yes , I have to look at the uh market potential for this product , uh , like consumer likings and everything , what is the potential for this product and are we able to achieve our a net profit or our aims or not ? 
UNKNOWN Then Sorry . 
UNKNOWN P press F_ five to start it first . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I can , okay . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Jesus . 
UNKNOWN Uh then uh the methodology I adopted to find out all this was market survey . 
UNKNOWN A a detailed market survey on consumers was done to find out their likings and dislikings , what they prefer what they not prefer , w what problems they do encounter in all this type of things . 
UNKNOWN And what we got was , we found that if you uh , what they th what problems they are having with different uh remote controls available in the market . 
UNKNOWN Seventy five percent of users they do find it that the remote controls available in the market are ugly . 
UNKNOWN They are not so good looking . 
UNKNOWN So , we have to put stress on this , uh we have to take care of this fact also like our design , uh should be appropriate , should be good looking for the consumers . 
UNKNOWN And yes that's wi uh this will definitely , this can definitely put uh uh enhance our sales . 
UNKNOWN Uh and even uh the good thing about this is that eighty percent of users they are willing to pay high uh pay more for this uh good looking remote controls also . 
UNKNOWN So even if the available market goes for the available uh even if the market goes for the available remote control is less even then we can sell it at twenty five Euros , which maybe which may seem quite high but if our looks are are if the re remote control we design have a good better uh better look uh designs, then we can hope that consumers will prefer these g remote controls . 
CONFIRMATION Excellent . 
UNKNOWN Then And the second thing , some some companies they think that they should have more and more functions of the users uh or in their remote controls , but rather than those having more functions in the remote controls we should emphasise what actually consumer want , what they operate , rather than making it too complicated . 
UNKNOWN Because mostly it has been found that fifty percent of the users they use only ten percent of the buttons , so there is no point of having ninety percent buttons making the remote controls too bulky , too complicated too expensive a because I think I believe that technology is useful only if uh the consumers they want to use it . 
UNKNOWN Otherwise there is no point of having all this type of things . 
UNKNOWN So this will not only reduce the cost of our remote controls but it will increase our profit also . 
UNKNOWN So we have to take care of this fact also . 
UNKNOWN Then . 
UNKNOWN Uh it was function I want to go to . 
UNKNOWN Oh you wanna go back ? 
UNKNOWN Just escape . 
UNKNOWN Uh , escape , okay thank you . 
UNKNOWN Then if we look at this slide, uh these are in your shared documents, you can see , like Uh , sorry . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So , sorry I was just gonna say , what was the question for this ? 
UNKNOWN Or is are you coming on to that ? 
UNKNOWN Ah t look all the market potential , what uh how we should design consu our remote controls , what they should be there so as to en enhance our profit , enhance our sales . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So these percentages are are what ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , these are different age group persons like uh sorry , I can open it in another way . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Uh , yes . 
UNKNOWN Speech recognition . 
UNKNOWN If we look at the costs whether the consumers they are willing to uh pay more for speech recognition in a remote control or not , we can find that they up to a thirty five years age group we have a very good disliking for this uh this uh point , like for speech recognition in a remote control . 
UNKNOWN So we can emphasise on this point also like , because it will definitely enhance our sales in this ag in this particular age group from uh fifteen to thirty five , and I uh and I think that most of the users of the rem uh T_V_ are belong to this age group . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN So we should look Yeah . 
UNKNOWN We're als we we're looking at who buys it as well . 
UNKNOWN We can look at that that factor also , so yes . 
UNKNOWN Uh , which I think the twenty five to thirty five is uh usual , sort of . 
UNKNOWN Mm , mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So , and And then Yes . 
UNKNOWN Fifteen to twe Okay . 
UNKNOWN I think so . 
UNKNOWN Uh if we look at this data how how uh h how what are the problems the consumers are facing with the existing remote controls in the market . 
UNKNOWN They find that thirt uh thirty five percent uh thirty four percent of the consumers they find too difficult to operate a remote control . 
UNKNOWN So it should be in such a way that it should be easy to learn how to operate these remote controls and we should provide pl uh spe uh proper manuals for its use also so as that people consumers could easily learn . 
UNKNOWN They need not to have any , much technical knowledge to see uh to know how to operate these remote controls . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So this is also a very goo uh major factor to loo uh take into consideration to enhance our profits and sales . 
UNKNOWN So um this is all about uh market potential by me . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Uh , yes , th thank you . 
CONFIRMATION Okay , thank you . 
UNKNOWN Um , follow on with Helen ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah please . 
UNKNOWN Yep , sure , that's cool , um Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah we have to take that out . 
UNKNOWN Oh , so we do yeah . 
UNKNOWN Sorry . 
UNKNOWN Fun and games . 
UNKNOWN Sorry . 
UNKNOWN Don't know if the cable's gonna be long enough . 
UNKNOWN Uh sorry , I have . 
UNKNOWN I think I just kicked over whatever it runs on underneath as well . 
UNKNOWN Brian , this one also I . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN I can turn my computer quickly if that's okay . 
THANKS Thank you very much Brian . 
UNKNOWN If you want me to help , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um , yep . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay , and then what do I press , F_ eight ? 
UNKNOWN Uh F_ eight . 
UNKNOWN Function F_ eight . 
UNKNOWN Function F_ eight . 
UNKNOWN Oh right . 
UNKNOWN Mm s . 
CONFIRMATION Okay , cool . 
UNKNOWN It's not coming . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN Function F_ eight , okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN No signal . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Computer . 
UNKNOWN There you go . 
UNKNOWN Computer adjusting , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Cool . 
UNKNOWN Okay and then how do I press the the big one , to get it on to the big F_ five and I press that again to get it off as well do I ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh F_ five . 
UNKNOWN Um , F_ five and escape'll bring it back and just uh the left button for advancing . 
UNKNOWN Escape . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so um I'm the interface design designer , User Interface Designer sorry , uh I'm concerned with um w what effect the apparatus should have on the user and um I'm I'm also I want to point out that our motto , put the fashion in electronics , so obviously we as a company we want to make our products trendy and fashionable , it's a big concern of ours . 
UNKNOWN Okay , and how do I press n just the next button ? 
UNKNOWN Uh just a left uh left mouse button . 
UNKNOWN The arrow ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So um I looked at existing designsand also um the information that Raj gave us was very useful about what people like , what people dislike . 
UNKNOWN Um and what people fashionable , because we said people between twenty five and thirty five were the main um buyers of of our T_V_ I think . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So um what they like and what they find fashionable . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN And ergonomics , we said um , I don't know I haven't actually been able to do any of this myself , but um maybe that comes up , I don't know . 
UNKNOWN That can come under Arlo as well . 
UNKNOWN And the findings , well the basic that was the basic function to send messages to the television set . 
UNKNOWN That's what people want to do . 
CONFUSION Uh . 
UNKNOWN Um , so they need to be included , um , but I've got some pictures here of some leading ones . 
UNKNOWN I don't know how to get to them , do I press F_ five is it ? 
UNKNOWN Uh if you if you escape then you can see your bar . 
UNKNOWN escape ? 
UNKNOWN Oh okay , cool . 
UNKNOWN I haven't got my glasses on so I hope it's this one . 
UNKNOWN These are two leading um remote controls at the moment . 
UNKNOWN Uh okay . 
UNKNOWN You know they're grey , they've I mean this one's got loads of buttons , it's hard to tell from here what they actually do , and they don't look very exciting at all . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN Um , personally I prefer this one just because it's looks easier use , it's a bit more sleek with more of this silver stuff , um , but there you go , that's what we're up against , and I think we can do much better than that . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Of course . 
UNKNOWN Um hang on . 
UNKNOWN We hope so . 
UNKNOWN F_ five , okay , sorry . 
UNKNOWN Personal preferences . 
UNKNOWN Um , well I think we need to l I think the ergonomics is quite um important , um Uh-huh . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , particularly if we've uh there was a bit in Raj's about R_S_I_ and things as well . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And um I thought not too edgy and like a box , more kind of hand-held more um not as uh computery and or organic , yeah , more organic shape I think . 
UNKNOWN Organic . 
UNKNOWN Um simple designs, like the last one we just saw , not too many buttons and as Raj pointed out , only ten percent fifty percent of people only use ten percent of the buttons , so I think what we can miss out on the buttons we can make up for in design and and how nice it looks . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Sales , . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um , hand-held and portable I think is portamint is important because T_F_T_ have just um released um I think is it a a remote control for presentationsor uh and a big seven inch big screen , anyway , so um Yeah , no seven inches isn't that big but um anyway um so hand-held and portable and uh m I thought about other functions for T_V_ but as you pointed out people don't actually want that , so maybe we forget about that . 
UNKNOWN Yeah it's like a , yeah . 
UNKNOWN It's . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN And also the company want to keep it stuck to the T_V_ for uh to keep down the production time . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It's for one T_V_ oh right okay , sure . 
UNKNOWN And so the last thing I thought w which I quickly mentioned in the other one was maybe a bit of a gimmick to set us apart from other people , like glow-in-the-dark um which does already e exist but it's not very widely used I don't think . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Exactly . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Easy finder with the a whistle function or something , or rechargeable station because it's a pain when you run out of batteries . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And I think that , yep , that's it . 
UNKNOWN That's cool . 
UNKNOWN So uh , I noticed your talk about speech recognition and whistling , and uh I was just curious to know , have we done any research into how many people can whistle ? 
UNKNOWN Okay ? 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um , or if is that a function we want in the remote ? 
UNKNOWN Um , I haven't been able to Mm-hmm , yeah or some sort of voice Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um , do you have trouble whistling ? 
UNKNOWN I don't , but I I know a lot of people do right . 
UNKNOWN Really ? 
UNKNOWN Ooh . 
UNKNOWN Yeah it just I mean it has to be a certain kind of whistle too , right ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I suppose that's true . 
UNKNOWN Well I suppo uh you could y you could have the you could have the basically um instead of a whistle if it's got the voice recognition you could have it just , you know , where are you ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN That's costly though . 
UNKNOWN . 
UNKNOWN Um a much easier thing is just any loud noise like clapping um , shouting , you know , uh and then , what would the response be ? 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Sounds good . 
UNKNOWN It beeps back at you or something ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , something . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Well , uh let me set this up . 
UNKNOWN So I plug it in , press F_ five ? 
UNKNOWN Function F_ five ? 
UNKNOWN Function F_ eight for the um the uh Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Or function F_ eight ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Oh you need to twiddle the thingamibobsy thing . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN I think it's uh just to lock it in . 
UNKNOWN It's got it . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN So as the Industrial Designer my job is to take an input from you guys , um so it's good you went first , and I jotted down some notesas to what are the b needs and uh what kind of novel features we can add to differentiate our product from the others . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
UNKNOWN Let's remember that . 
UNKNOWN Um so Raj told us that uh consumers are willing to spend more for fancy products , and um he also mentioned that uh the current products don't always match users' operating behaviour . 
UNKNOWN Um , a lot of the buttons aren't used , and uh he mentioned that they're not fun to use . 
UNKNOWN And uh a novel feature which uh we just brought up was this this automatic speech recognition feature or noise detection feature for when you lose the remote , there could be a little microphone on it , and any noise over a certain threshold um it'll pick up as a a distress signal um from you and it'll beep back and say you know oh here I am or something of this sort . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN But sure surely that would have to be um sort of specific rather than above a threshold 'cause if you had a loud movie on you're likely to get it beeping back at you . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Oh yeah , yeah , that's true . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Well maybe you could have a um hmm tha that would be a consideration to take into account yes . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Sorry I didn't mean to derail you there . 
UNKNOWN Yeah well tha that's uh for later down the road um , and then as for the user interface it should be trendy , um and not computery , right , so more low tech and not too many buttons . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So I took these all into consideration and also I have some limitations from the boss . 
UNKNOWN Right um , and practical limitations which I kinda threw out the window . 
UNKNOWN And so I did a little research and unfortunately all I had to work on was our uh our corporate archives of the great products we've made before , which include , you know , um space craft , coffee makers , and bullet trains Or uh or a high speed train . 
UNKNOWN Ah is that what that is ? 
UNKNOWN Right and having personally worked with all these products uh I have a great deal of experience with uh with industrial design of these . 
UNKNOWN Well that's cool . 
UNKNOWN If you if you can build space craft you'll have no problem with a remote control , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Yeah sure . 
UNKNOWN So , I figured , just put 'em all together . 
UNKNOWN You got a a caffeine powered space shuttle train transport to your T_V_ , and um as for the user interface problem , you know , too many buttons . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Give it one button and and it's a you know , for the the cowboy in all of us I I'm not quite sure what the the function is there but Yeah it's a g I mean you could have a you know a Right . 
UNKNOWN Right okay . 
UNKNOWN Well I like that design . 
UNKNOWN Is that just switches on the speech recognition and it's entirely speech operated , is it ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So I think I I missed the budget thing , it was fifty million Euros ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And we gotta sell twenty five of them ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , not a problem . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Fifty million was uh prof As a profit . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Ah now it's fif fifty million Euros we've gotta uh we've g gotta make profit , so we're making that at twelve and a half Euros a time . 
UNKNOWN Oh okay , so I I mixed those numbers . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Well I guess more realistically then , we need a product that's got some kinda nifty outer casing , cheap plastic uh , you know , um that should be just like uh a tenth of the price maybe or less . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN An energy source which'd probably just be uh your regular batteries um , we don't wanna have it Uh . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Would it be possible to have the rechargeable idea ? 
UNKNOWN Is that is that gonna mark up a lot ? 
UNKNOWN Or a little base station or something , . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah , we could do that too . 
UNKNOWN Um , I hadn't thought of that . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN That might cost more though , 'cause obviously with batteries we don't need to provide , well we provide the first batteries , but it's more , it's that's cheaper to just provide batteries . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN I mean if you think about these base stations now it's essentially just a a lead with a sort of self connecting brake in it , so I don't think it'd up up the price that much . 
UNKNOWN A battery in it , kinda . 
UNKNOWN Right , so so the unirs the user interface uh the canonical user interface for these would be just a bunch of buttons , but since we're a cutting edge company , we uh of course will have alternatives like uh speech recognition , whistling recognition and rocket power behind our product . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um and lastly the transmission interface is uh , just some engineering thing you don't have to worry about . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um so here's you know , a great schematic that my uh apprentice designer gave me . 
UNKNOWN Um as you can see the the remote control have parts and those parts look like that and um you know it's got a little operating procedure that looks something like that . 
UNKNOWN And I suppose you all know how it works because we've all used it and we wouldn't be in a company designing remote controls if we didn't know what they were so uh personal preferences , I think uh programmable options which um just require a small amount of memory , uh non volatile memory , just um so the user can put in their favourite channels and maybe their preferred volume settings so that when they turn it on it's not blasting . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Mm that's a good idea actually I like the programmable options . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , me too . 
UNKNOWN Oh okay . 
UNKNOWN And the uh , the bells and whistles that we mentioned you know , they take more budgeting , um more technical uh expenditure of effort and it's also much more likely to not work if if we add these bells and whistles . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Mm 'kay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN That's all I got . 
UNKNOWN 'Kay , thank you very much , um I'll take that back . 
UNKNOWN Ooh that's tight . 
UNKNOWN Right , also so um a notice I got not very long before the meeting , so didn't manage to forward it on to you , it is let's see , I'll find it myself , um Ta nah . 
UNKNOWN Okay , I don't think we need to screw it in . 
UNKNOWN Just push it . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN We had that um to dis-include teletext um because it's become outdated , and everybody uses the internet anyway . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um , dunno what Oracle would have to say with that but never mind . 
UNKNOWN Um it's only for the television , which I'm presuming means it's for a specific television , and um instead of colours and sorta colour options , they want corporate colour and slogan somehow implemented in the new design . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Corporate colour . 
UNKNOWN Yellow . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Yellow . 
UNKNOWN I presume . 
UNKNOWN Um , everything , all their sort of uh you know the uh corporate website and everything's yellow . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN And the logo uh the sort of slogan we put the fa fashion in electronics uh I don't know exactly how sort of incorpor I mean , I guess if you're going for a sort of globular shape you could kind of have it working its way round it or something . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh , where am I ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so , we have to decide on which functions we're going to actually have . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN Uh , now , we had as listed options we had speech recognition potentially , flat screen interface , L_C_D_ interface um we also want to limit the number of buttons so we'll pretty much take that one as read . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN We'll use the the basic functions for a television . 
UNKNOWN No teletext . 
UNKNOWN Um okay hold on . 
UNKNOWN Although the the danger with that is , it could look a bit cheap . 
UNKNOWN Not enough buttons you mean ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well Mm . 
UNKNOWN So sorta strike a balance between a a few and a or it looks like we're just cutting on the um I do however have this from over my head , that they don't want teletext on it . 
UNKNOWN On the number of buttons , kind of functions and stuff . 
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm , okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay , cool . 
UNKNOWN Uh maybe Raj you could find out what people would think about that , or maybe they'll send some information about that , about um what people , whether people would require um teletext in a remote teletext option in a remote control . 
UNKNOWN About cost . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Okay um . 
UNKNOWN So uh I take it your position Arlo is that the bells and whistles we've gotta come up with the a gimmick but not too complicated a gimmick . 
UNKNOWN Yeah yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um so I mean a a the sort of inkling I'm getting from little bits of um web chatter that I'm getting sent is that they're quite interested in a T_F_T_ display , interactive display . 
UNKNOWN However that does sound a bit like the more complicated design that rav uh sorry Raj um said people didn't like . 
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm , mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Although I guess if there's a sort of If you think about standard interfaces that people use already , sort of Windows-style drop down menus or whatever , I think maybe that's a bit , going a bit far but you know like in a basic sense that you could have your basic selection of buttons , and if you hit a sort of menu at the top you have um it goes to a different selection of buttons , so it sorta keeps it simple . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um glow in the dark , is that sort of with a light inside it or is it sort of glow in the dark material ? 
UNKNOWN Um Glow in the dark material I was thinking . 
CONFUSION Uh . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um , so I I guess that would be cheaper than a light I think . 
UNKNOWN I Uh may I say something about ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh actually I think it's really really very important point uh as if we look at the market because people mor fifty percent people they find that the remote controls are often lost somewhere in the remote , in the room . 
UNKNOWN But yeah are lost and means they forget where they have kept the remote control last time . 
UNKNOWN Often lost s was that , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Lost , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN But if we add speech recognition as well as glow in the dark then both these factors will help their locating the remote control , like if they come and speak something at the remote control uh replies to something something and it glows in the dark . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Both these factors uh both these points will help them to locate the where they have kept this remote control , and this will definitely enhance our uh market sales , so we should take it into consideration also . 
UNKNOWN That's cool . 
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm , mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN That's cool . 
CONFIRMATION Okay , cool . 
UNKNOWN Um speech recognition I take it I don't , I've I know of no products um that use speech recognition well . 
UNKNOWN Well hmm . 
UNKNOWN Oh it's They're act there there was a remote control that came out two years ago that had a some basic speech recognition on it . 
UNKNOWN You could programme it with your channels and then you say you know like uh B_B_C_ one and it goes to that channel . 
UNKNOWN Really ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , it didn't work very well though because of this noise interference problem . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN They mentioned you know if the television says you are listening to B_B_C_ one . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , or a yeah an advert an advert for B_B_C_ two on B_B_C_ one'll switch the channel for you kinda thing . 
UNKNOWN Right , right , and so there was a lot of this , you'd be watching the T_V_ and then all of a sudden it'd it'd pick up a noise and turn it off or you know or turn the volume off or something , but if you can work around that that noise problem Right . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN Uh-huh . 
UNKNOWN Well what about this might get a bit too expensive actually , but what about um something that's built into the T_V_ um that you can press and it'll send out a little signal you know like the ones that we can't hear or something um that that will activate the remote control starts to beep . 
UNKNOWN Ah , that's a good idea . 
UNKNOWN So like a kind of backwards remote from the telly . 
UNKNOWN If you find if y Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Right and then it would do just you know , uh subtractive kind of cancellation of the noise . 
UNKNOWN What you could do then would be you have uh a remote controlled by the T_V_ speaker , or not a remo I'm sorry , a microphone by the T_V_ speaker and a transmitter there that sends back to your remote , 'cause you can't um expect uh the the television manufacturers to to put that feature into their T_V_s . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's the only thing , yeah . 
UNKNOWN But yeah , then you have like the little se separate module by the T_V_ speaker which Right , and then the remote control would know um what's being produced by the television . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN That we should just stick on , yeah . 
UNKNOWN That comes with our remote control . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And that's a sort of basic R_F_ kind of frequency so it'll be cheap . 
UNKNOWN Right , right . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Right , right . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Yeah that's certainly possible then an another thing was about this losing the remote and trying to find it again . 
UNKNOWN If you do have this sorta speech interface to it , you don't even need to find it . 
UNKNOWN You just say you know , um whatever you whatever you want the remote for , you know to change the channel or to uh turn the T_V_ on and off , you just shout your command to it and it would do it for you if it's within you know , within hearing range . 
UNKNOWN Uh-huh . 
UNKNOWN And uh you know it could be somewhere in the room y that you've no idea where it is and it would still do its job . 
UNKNOWN That could also be built into the T_V_ though , which might make our remote control a bit obsolete . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well , hopefully we're uh we're ahead of the curve . 
UNKNOWN It might do us out of a job . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , okay . 
UNKNOWN Um Okay . 
UNKNOWN I like the whole sort of remote feedback thing . 
UNKNOWN Um so I think rather than and that also kind of takes out the speech recognition in terms of the interference of it not working very well and things like that , so I th yeah and expense and the time . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN And the expense . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So I think if we're going to go well I mean like the thing about the there's the problem with the T_F_T_ or the L_C_D_ kind of thing is if you're also wanting the the kind of uh organic globby sort of feeling to it then you might have trouble incorporating the screen . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Um , but I guess not I thin we'll just we'll just pretend that's not a problem . 
UNKNOWN Um uh and how are you about the glow in the dark material ? 
UNKNOWN Is that Contrast contra well . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Maybe not even all of it 'cause we said um colours and fashion w were important so maybe um just like a little l line that's kind of around the outside and then you can make the rest a different colour . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , no th the material's cheap but it's just uh the the glow in the dark material needs some light to charge it you know , and then uh if you're , if you're sitting in the dark for too long it uh it won't glow any more . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , okay . 
UNKNOWN So if it's dow it's d uh yeah . 
UNKNOWN Or if it's down under the couch cushions um which is where I usually find mine . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Um Okay , well we can use we can still use the glow in the dark as a gimmick essentially , um if we're gonna have to if we're gonna have the logo on as well , bright yellow logo in our our um slogan . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , 'cause what I thought , main Slogan , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh then you know they're gonna be fairly brightly coloured anyway , and we can have sort of a a a trimming as well , of the glow in the dark material , just as gimmickyness . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause yeah , that w more than finding it , that was more like you know if you're watching a film in the dark , you can um still see the remote control . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Alright , so n sorta if if if we're gon if we're gonna go with the idea of um uh of feedback , sort of remote finder , then that kinda stuffs that one out then . 
UNKNOWN That was more of a a gimmick . 
UNKNOWN Do you think ? 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Uh it makes it fairly unnecessary then . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , unnecessary . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um , okay so scratch that . 
UNKNOWN Uh so we've got do we want to go with the T_F_T_ idea or the is that far too expensive ? 
UNKNOWN Um yeah we're getting a lot of features now , I I think Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well I mean I think I think the sort of find the finder things I mean it's uh I could probably write the circuit diagramfor that myself . 
UNKNOWN Um Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Well , I think a consideration too is that these uh remotes get abused a lot , you know they get thrown around , there's a good chance the the T_F_T_ screen would break or uh get damaged . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN They're pretty fragile . 
UNKNOWN So is that one of our definite requirements that they wa that it needs a T_F_T_ screen ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um no , I mean that was going on ravs uh Raj's sort of um marketing research I guess . 
UNKNOWN Um Uh So we'll stick with sort of programmability um for the buttons that we do have . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN So that's sort of included in your sub-module kind of stuff , um Uh you were finding out about teletext . 
UNKNOWN Yeah mm . 
UNKNOWN If you could find out that uh Um I think we're gonna scratch the speech recognition as a bit of a um expensive , no ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Totally , it takes cheap speech recognition , she they wi Yeah . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN Yeah you think so ? 
UNKNOWN Oh no it's it's much cheaper than the T_F_T_ , it's just a microphone and some some integrated circuits . 
UNKNOWN Oh right , okay . 
UNKNOWN Is it not the circuits that cost Oh right , okay . 
UNKNOWN And it'd it'd be a small vocabulary speech recognition system , like a Okay . 
UNKNOWN Uh well that kind of takes back the R_F_ the R_F_ remote sort of idea as well . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Five minutes . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Decisions . 
UNKNOWN Uh , votes , let's vote . 
UNKNOWN Who wants T_F_T_ ? 
UNKNOWN No-one does . 
UNKNOWN Excellent , so we'll go with speech recognition , yeah ? 
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm , that's cool . 
UNKNOWN Um , speech recognition , limited buttons , organic design . 
UNKNOWN Um if it's not too expensive s I think it's a good gimmick . 
UNKNOWN And what else was I thinking of that I haven't written down and therefore fallen out my head , programmability . 
UNKNOWN Glow in dark . 
UNKNOWN Uh Uh o okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And also , integrating the , remember to integrate the logo and the s slogan . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so . 
UNKNOWN Um can you put all these reports in the project documentsfolder if they're not already in there as well . 
UNKNOWN So , it just helps me summarize them . 
UNKNOWN Yeah yeah . 
UNKNOWN Here ? 
CONFIRMATION Sure . 
UNKNOWN And um I'll put any I'm I'm putting anything I do in there anyway , so uh Uh pro uh project documents. 
UNKNOWN And where is it sorry ? 
UNKNOWN On A_M_I_ scenario controller . 
UNKNOWN So it should be when you save on your desktop , so it goes save as , or And then uh hit that little folder up thing again . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN Uh it is in shared documents? 
UNKNOWN Where am I ? 
UNKNOWN Projoct uh projector . 
UNKNOWN Project documents, yeah , it's on your desktop as well . 
UNKNOWN Again . 
UNKNOWN All the way to the top , yeah that's up to desktop . 
UNKNOWN Right and then project documents. 
CONFIRMATION Okay , cool . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN It is not giving anything . 
UNKNOWN Shared documents. 
UNKNOWN And I will tr getting strings of um information , I'll try and forward any specific to anybody in particular , as soon as I get them now , rather than I was about to sort of tell you about the changes before the meeting , and then the meeting turned up , so I did . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Did you get my email? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Just making sure . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So Okay . 
UNKNOWN What I thought as well about the material is um maybe not this kind of material , but maybe more like um this kind of rubbery material , it's a bit more bouncy , like you said they get chucked around a lot . 
UNKNOWN Um , a bit more durable and that can also be ergonomic and it kind of feels a bit different from all the other remote controls . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN The rubber rather than Mm-hmm , mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN More sort of um flesh-like than plasticky sort of . 
UNKNOWN Wow . 
UNKNOWN Um but we have to take care like But we have to take care of our children also if they means if children catch hold of your or if they chew it it shouldn't be too harmful . 
UNKNOWN So , whatever material we use it should be yeah . 
UNKNOWN Oh no , ethics , that's gonna cost us money . 
UNKNOWN So we have to safety point of view also , we have to take care . 
UNKNOWN Okay , safety . 
UNKNOWN Oh I think wi with the more organic shape of it it won't be as it won't as have many sharp corners as that , so that's something good , um I dunno , I mean That's a good idea . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It sme smells good for children . 
UNKNOWN We could go comp yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN We could go completely out of the box and make the thing a big red ball foam ball . 
UNKNOWN And it's got the thing on the inside . 
UNKNOWN And there's no buttons at all , it's always on , and just yell at it , and it works . 
UNKNOWN That sounds , yeah it's gonna have to be it's gonna be have a big yellow foam ball , yeah , sorry . 
UNKNOWN And then ch children will love it . 
UNKNOWN Interesting . 
UNKNOWN Oh yellow , yellow ball . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , d with the colour , um does it have to be all yellow , do you know ? 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Please God no . 
CONFUSION Um . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN Well , I wouldn't th I mean , my reaction to an all-yellow remote control wouldn't be anything other than horror , so I think just having it surrounding the logo . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Small logo with the like a small yellow strip or y yellow with the logo in it . 
UNKNOWN Having a little bit . 
UNKNOWN Okay cool . 
UNKNOWN Mm mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm , okay . 
CONFIRMATION Cool . 
UNKNOWN And I'll see if I can argue with boss about putting the what was it ? 
UNKNOWN We put we put fashion into Whoops , it's not working . 
UNKNOWN Can't believe I've forgotten it . 
UNKNOWN We put the fashion in electronics . 
UNKNOWN Oh yeah , that's a good one that . 
UNKNOWN I bet that'll catch on well . 
UNKNOWN Yeah so . 
UNKNOWN Okay , any last worries , queries ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Twelve thirty . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN S s I know what you're thinking . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Okay then , lunchtime , yay . 
UNKNOWN That's good . 
UNKNOWN Okay , that felt a bit more like a something with order and and reason to it than the last one . 
UNKNOWN This is quite fun actually . 
UNKNOWN Wow . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Has anybo oh . 
UNKNOWN I really don't Yeah , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Has anybody pressed okay , it vibrates . 
UNKNOWN It's pretty cool . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN Check here . 
UNKNOWN Wow you've your first page. 
UNKNOWN I was just writing really big . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , got small writing . 
UNKNOWN Yeah I've been using up the pages. 
UNKNOWN I don't wanna waste it . 
UNKNOWN I've finished the meeting now . 
UNKNOWN Oh , everybody needs k questionnaire . 
UNKNOWN Another questionnaire . 
UNKNOWN Um we are So the meeting will have about the same format as the last time . 
UNKNOWN So switching over I've just left uh my first two screens . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um I have mailed you the minutesof the last meeting uh just to save time . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Cool . 
UNKNOWN Um and is there any questions you have that arised from last meeting that are particularly bothering you ? 
UNKNOWN Mm um . 
UNKNOWN N No ? 
UNKNOWN No , I don't think so . 
CONFIRMATION Okay , cool . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN Then we shall start with a presentationfrom Raj . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Hi , me Raj , again . 
UNKNOWN Uh in this meeting I I'm going to discuss about the trend watching , uh how these trends is going to affect our market potential and how important is this . 
UNKNOWN So we have to look on this . 
UNKNOWN First of all methodology . 
UNKNOWN The met methodology to find out the trend was incl uh was done in a way We have done a rec not only a recent remote control market survey , but we also considered the latest fre fashion trends of the market , because we think that this is also a factor which will affect our sales and profit . 
UNKNOWN So what are our findings ? 
UNKNOWN In our uh in our findings we have seen that when we did our remote control market survey we found that uh people l uh people do have preference for tho fancy mobi uh f remote controls which look and feel very good , rather than having a functional look and feel uh good . 
UNKNOWN So this sh this clearly indicates their preference for the design their outlook of the remote controls . 
UNKNOWN So we should take into uh we should consider this factor as the most important factor , because this factor is twice as important , the second factor which is further ti twice the as important as the sec as uh the third factor . 
UNKNOWN So this factor becomes the most important factor in our surv uh uh in our mark uh means in take in designing our rem uh remote controls . 
UNKNOWN The last one is the most important one , is it ? 
UNKNOWN No the first one is the uh the outlook of the mobile , the it should have a fancy outlook , the fancy design uh rather than just having a functional look and feel good , it should have a fancy look and foo feel good . 
UNKNOWN Oh , sorry . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN The second most important aspect is that remote control should be a technologically uh innovative . 
UNKNOWN We must have some technological advancement in the remote control tha rather than just putting it as it is as the other remo uh remote controls are . 
UNKNOWN So it uh should be technologically innovative like glow-in-the-dark or speech recognition , something like that . 
UNKNOWN So that indicates our technological advancement . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN And the third most important aspect in the ta to take into consideration is that it should be easy to use , like it shouldn't be too much co complicated , there shouldn't be too many buttons on this mobi uh remote control , it shouldn't be too complicated uh like this way . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN And it should be uh and customers should be provided with manuals that is easy to understand in their local language , something . 
UNKNOWN So that they could know how to use these remote controls . 
UNKNOWN When we did uh f fashions uh , recent fashion uh our recent fashion update shows that Ah yeah ? 
UNKNOWN Sorry . 
UNKNOWN I was just reading fruit and vegetables . 
UNKNOWN Hard to know how we are going to incorporate that . 
UNKNOWN Y yeah uh yeah , we have to , because uh d you can see how people have related their clothes , shoes , and everything with fruits and vegetables , because the g world is now changing it's trend towards organic , becoming more and more organic , becoming Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN We should make a big sponge lemon , and then it'd be it would be yellow . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Th that's very good . 
UNKNOWN It's Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So something like that we we should do . 
UNKNOWN Glow-in-the-dark . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN And people uh the f feel of the material is expected to be spongy rather than just having a plastic look , hard look . 
UNKNOWN Well , that's good . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN That's what we kind of predicted anyway . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So so that they could play with it while handi uh while handling it . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So that should also be taken into consideration . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So these are my views . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Okay , the spongy , not real spongy , you can Do you think like rubber would be good or does it really want to be like gel kind of stuff ? 
UNKNOWN So No it ca y a The rubber which is good for health and which is quite disposable that we can take into co Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Quite disposable . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause we It shouldn't be have any harm to the environment also , because our company is very well for taking all these concerns into consideration , so we don't want to have any harm to the society , so So that's all . 
UNKNOWN Oh okay . 
UNKNOWN Alright , okay . 
UNKNOWN Uh-huh . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Fashion . 
CONFIRMATION Cool . 
UNKNOWN Mm 'kay . 
UNKNOWN Fruit and veg , well there you go . 
UNKNOWN Just what I think of when I think of a remote control . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN A remote control ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And were there any factors that weren't important in the survey , that they said we don't want ? 
UNKNOWN S uh we didn't find out any such point . 
UNKNOWN Or was it just Okay . 
UNKNOWN Uh yes , there could be , but we couldn't find out any , so Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Mm-mm-mm-mm . 
CONFIRMATION Cool . 
UNKNOWN Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm . 
UNKNOWN F_ , what is it ? 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Function F_ eight . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN No signal . 
UNKNOWN Oh no , . 
UNKNOWN Is that ? 
UNKNOWN No , it's got it's got it . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , uh yeah , uh yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay , and then F_ five , right ? 
UNKNOWN Excuse me . 
UNKNOWN Uh , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um okay , so the interface concept um . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN The interface specification , what people um how they interact with it basically , I think . 
UNKNOWN Um so the method , we looked at existing designs, what are the what's good about them , what's bad about them , um I looked at their flaws , so we're going to look at their flaws , everything . 
UNKNOWN Um and what the survey told us and what we think would be good , so a bit of imagination . 
UNKNOWN Mm 'kay . 
UNKNOWN Uh the findings , I've got some pictures to show you as well . 
UNKNOWN either . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so most remote controls use graphical interface , where you um have got s buttons and you point it rather than having the output as a a stream of text or something . 
UNKNOWN Uh okay . 
UNKNOWN Um and we also found that there's inconsistent layout, which makes it confusing . 
UNKNOWN So I think for our remote control There is some inconsistency already in ec existing in between remote controls , but I think standard kind of um shape and uh play and those kind of but buttons like the the top right for on and off or something , I think , people find that important,'cause then it's easy to use . 
UNKNOWN Right , okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And we've got some pictures of some uh new remote controls to show you . 
UNKNOWN Do I press Escape F_ five ? 
CONFIRMATION Excellent . 
UNKNOWN Uh no just escape should uh 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN Or just Escape , okay . 
UNKNOWN Um , oh I still haven't got my glasses on . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , okay . 
UNKNOWN So these are the some of the pictures of existing ones . 
UNKNOWN Wow . 
UNKNOWN I'll just walk you through them . 
UNKNOWN This one is a voice recognition . 
UNKNOWN And that's the kind of idea we're going for . 
UNKNOWN Looks pretty complicated . 
UNKNOWN There's um an L_C_D_ thing , which we thought could I thought could get a bit confusing and a bit expensive as well for us . 
UNKNOWN Right , okay . 
UNKNOWN This one is got a kind of scroll like a mouse , which Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm , like the middle button . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um and But I'm not exactly sure how you'd use that , like would the computer come Uh-huh , that's like the L_C_D_ one , is it ? 
UNKNOWN Ah it's kinda like scrolling uh right , well , if I s if I'm thinking of the right one , I've got the same thing in front of my monitor , you scroll it and the when you reach the sort of um menu item that you require , you press the middle of the scroll . 
UNKNOWN Right , okay . 
UNKNOWN But the one below that has got like a little scroll function on the side . 
UNKNOWN But I presume that the functions must come up on the T_V_ screen . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , presumably . 
UNKNOWN I think that's what that is . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So these are just a few ideas . 
UNKNOWN Again that's just quite boring shape , grey , looks quite space-agey , but too many buttons , I think on that one . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , looks like uh looks like something out of a jet . 
UNKNOWN Uh it looks threatening . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , it does look kind of dangerous . 
UNKNOWN It looks like yeah . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um this one I thought was really cool . 
UNKNOWN It's w it's got the programmability function that we talked about . 
UNKNOWN You can put it in there , it's for your kids , and it's quite an organic shape and the little circle around there is pretty cool . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN And that's really easy to use , bright , so I like this one lot for our design . 
UNKNOWN I think something like that would be good . 
UNKNOWN Wow . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I m I mean the one thing I think about about these ones is um these kl uh secured areas um , I've seen a lot of them with the the cover missing . 
UNKNOWN Of course yellow . 
UNKNOWN Right , yeah . 
UNKNOWN So like have it hinge rather than sort of clip on or whatever . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's true . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um so maybe that could be built into one of the things and it comes up on the T_V_ or something . 
UNKNOWN And this one , the over-sized one , I don't know about you , but I think it's a bit too gimmicky . 
UNKNOWN I don't think that will sell very well . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I mean is that not sort of to assist the blind or something , is it ? 
UNKNOWN I guess so . 
UNKNOWN I don't know . 
UNKNOWN I think that's a bit Yeah exactly . 
UNKNOWN Strange . 
UNKNOWN Then d blind don't watch T_V_ . 
UNKNOWN No they do , they do . 
UNKNOWN They listen to it . 
UNKNOWN They do ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And um this one is just pointing out . 
UNKNOWN I like some of these things um the the raised symbols and everything , but pointing out um that this one the volume it is kind of pressing down , but it would actually go up , because of the shape . 
UNKNOWN Right , okay . 
UNKNOWN So that could that's a bit confusing . 
UNKNOWN Um but the buttons on this I think are it's just showing you how you can have different different um buttons . 
UNKNOWN They don't have to be all the same . 
UNKNOWN So that's quite cool . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN 'Kay but people tend to recognise certain shapes to do certain things anyway , don't they ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , exactly . 
UNKNOWN Um F_ five . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN So there are some of the findings . 
UNKNOWN So we need to combine those ones um and I've just got an e-mail from our technical department saying that they have broken through with some new speech recognition software that you can program in . 
UNKNOWN Brilliant . 
UNKNOWN That's handy . 
UNKNOWN Um yeah it is , just in time , very handy . 
UNKNOWN Um so I think maybe incorporating that in our design would be good . 
UNKNOWN It's you program it like you say , record , um and then , play , and then , record , play machine , and stuff like that , so that's And it's much Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So that's quite cool . 
UNKNOWN Uh personal preferences just some imagination , the raised symbols I thought were good , the L_C_D_ , it does look smart , but I think maybe for our budget , do you think that would be a bit too expensive to have the Yeah . 
UNKNOWN The L_C_D_ and the other stuff uh , I think . 
UNKNOWN And the speech recognition , 'cause I think we're definitely going for the speech recognition , are we ? 
UNKNOWN But in our market survey we have seen that people are willing to pay more , but they want the quality , they want f fancy look , they want some new design , something new . 
UNKNOWN Uh-huh . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Uh-huh . 
UNKNOWN Uh yeah . 
UNKNOWN But our budget , we've Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It's still it's still got to get within our twelve fifty , you know . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So even if we increase our cost little bit , within uh some limits , and we give something new technological advancement as well as new design with fancy outlook , I think we will meet the requirements and we will be able to have a good sales in the market . 
UNKNOWN Uh-huh . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN I'm not sure if the if for twenty five Euros uh per uh twelve Euros fifty m manufacturing cost , . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Ben bana Hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I can't see tha Although , th I mean to be to be sure they have got I mean they are going crazy with the L_C_D_ technology now , so that you've got your L_C_D_ T_V_s and everything so maybe the small But I mean like I I the black and white , I guess , it just doesn't look funky enough . 
UNKNOWN The L_C_D_ . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN Um but , I mean , like even mobile phones or whatever have now have colour L_C_D_ screens , w I ju I mean I wouldn't know about the costs of them . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN S Uh-huh . 
UNKNOWN But uh price price not withstanding um , is it too complicated , is it gonna be too much just overload ? 
UNKNOWN Twelve fifty . 
UNKNOWN And the Uh i it will be easy because there will be , on L_C_D_ s screen , there will be different frent icons , they can just click ok okay , whatever they wa Ah yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's the thing , because Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Possibly . 
UNKNOWN But but the thing is when you use a remote control , you never look at it , right ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN You're looking at the T_V_ and and it's uh It just seems kind of like a a needless th So which vegetable ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN That's true , yeah . 
UNKNOWN And one of the survey findings was that they want it easy to use , so I think I'm not sure about the L_C_D_ . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN It's a it's great , it's a good idea , but for our budget and for the thing we're trying to go for eas easy to use , it's not the thing we should go for , I think . 
UNKNOWN Child-friendly , I thought this was good , as you pointed out the um the bit , it often goes missing especially with children , but it's a good shape and the organic is kind of we could make a vegetabley kind of round shape , I think . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well I mean we could make a Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I know , carrot . 
UNKNOWN Well , si since we're going for the uh the k the sort of company colours , I think your lemon wasn't that far s And if it doesn't work you know , we've just made a lemon . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN The the lemon . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well what are the options ? 
UNKNOWN But we don't want it to be Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um the child-friendly , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Easy to use , it seems quite easy to use . 
UNKNOWN I like the d the different shapes of the buttons and stuff . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN I think that's a good idea to go for . 
UNKNOWN I like I like the colourful buttons as well . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And the mouse one , I thought it was a good idea , because people use mo mice mouses now with the scrolling thing . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN I mean we are marketing to sort of twenty five to thirty five , so most people will have come in contact with that kind of use . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN S yeah . 
UNKNOWN So they'd be able to use that um , as I said I think i I'd presume it would come up on the screen . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um so there you go . 
UNKNOWN And that means tha that means you get to bump that bit to the T_V_ maker , so 'Kay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN So that's um the user interface design . 
UNKNOWN So okay , I'll take this out now then . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um so I guess there are a lot of options that we're gonna have to choose from among , and I'll I'll give you the uh , I guess , technical considerations for those . 
UNKNOWN There you go . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , looks like it . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Uh Yeah , I was just thinking the self same thing . 
UNKNOWN And I'm gonna use the whiteboard , just 'cause we haven't used it . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN So , the way I'm gonna do this is uh we're gonna take a look at some old remote controls , see how they work , uh reuse the the vital kind of um essential pieces of it , and then we'll throw in our new innovations um and keep it all within budget . 
UNKNOWN So uh yeah , looking inside a a very simple remote control . 
UNKNOWN Magic man . 
UNKNOWN Um this is what they sent me . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN Here's uh the competition , I suppose . 
UNKNOWN Um you open it up , there's a circuit board inside , um and there's a a chip , a processor , the T_A_ one one eight three five , which um receives input from the buttons , and ch Right , it's very they're very cheap remote . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So this is a standard off the shelf kind of a chip , is it ? 
UNKNOWN This remote costs nothing , you know . 
UNKNOWN Um so that takes a signals from the buttons and translates it into a sequence of pulses that it then sends to the to the amplifier , which is made of some transistors and amplifiers , op-amps , and then that gets sent to the uh to the L_E_D_ light , which I can kinda see is that little red light bulb at the end , and that sends out the infrared uh light signal to the television . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Oh here it is . 
UNKNOWN Um so this is kind of the the bear essentials that we need to have in our remote control , because it it defines the uh R Um no , I mean this is a very old one , so now with the new technology this is a a minimally small and cheap thing to make . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So can we make them to pretty much any size we like or is there a minimum or ? 
UNKNOWN They gotta be Almost a key-ring . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN So this is what we need to have for certain . 
CONFUSION Um . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So you know , as we said , we got the outer casing , which we have to decide , you know , what's it gonna be , um the board we have to use basically uh the same set-up , processor , um we'll probably use the more advanced processor than they had , amplifier and transmitter are all standard . 
UNKNOWN Um so for the casing , uh this an e-mail I got from our manufacturing team uh , you know , we have a bunch of options from wood , titanium , rubber , plastic , whatnot , um latex , double-curved , curved . 
UNKNOWN So lots of choices , what do we think ? 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN Uh or sponge , I guess , isn't on there , right . 
UNKNOWN Well . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Organic sponge . 
UNKNOWN Well , I mean like la latex has a kinda spongy feeling to it , doesn't it . 
UNKNOWN I'm not sure about the sponge . 
UNKNOWN Um Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh yeah , it's very elasticy for sure . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And that would k also give it kinda durability and and ther that's also f sorta relatively cheap to cast . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Yeah so Okay so , here are a a plastic , uh latex Oh right . 
UNKNOWN Um so maybe s uh a sort of uh plastic initial plastic with a a latex kinda sheath ? 
UNKNOWN I like the rubber , the stress balls , I think , you know , that could be a bit of a gimmick like it's good to hold and Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Oh right , okay . 
UNKNOWN I don't know what that stuff is . 
UNKNOWN So something with give to it . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN And that might be quite durable and easy to chuck around . 
UNKNOWN And and the colour is yellow , right ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , y yellow incorporated , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Or at least incorporating , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yellow , okay . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN I mean I forgot i we're sort of uh I don't know what other standard silver kind of Other parts or uh Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN I think Mm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , the buttons w like , 'cause there's gonna be the the cover the the rubber or the plastic casing and then the buttons in probably two different colours or i if we're having buttons actually , I don Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Mm' kay . 
UNKNOWN So yellow for the body , and then what colour for the buttons ? 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Um I quite like the multi-coloured buttons myself . 
UNKNOWN So multi-coloured buttons . 
UNKNOWN You do have ones like um play could be green or on and off is red , and stuff like that , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah or yeah a limit uh maybe even just a limited multi-colour so it it doesn't look too childish , perhaps . 
UNKNOWN Makes it easy to use . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's true , because that blue one did look quite hardish . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Although I mean this uh uh also comes to shape as well . 
UNKNOWN I mean if we are gonna make it a novel I mean double-curved sounds good to me if we're talking about sorta ergonomic and easy use , a bit comfier , you know . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Mm 'kay so the shape we wanna go Um how exactly ? 
UNKNOWN Maybe double What about a banana ? 
UNKNOWN Like uh an hour glass kind of figure , is that what you're thinking of , or just like a It's not Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah it's uh , yeah , that that'd be that's sort of comfortable to hold , easy to hold so you don't drop it . 
UNKNOWN Yeah ? 
UNKNOWN We could make novelty remote controls . 
UNKNOWN Okay , like we could have a big banana shaped remote control , 'cause it's yellow fruit , right ? 
UNKNOWN Well , yeah , I mean like Yeah , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Mm and a lemon might be a little hard to grip . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But then how would you point it ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN How would you point it ? 
UNKNOWN Oh i it doesn't matter which end you point , I guess . 
UNKNOWN What Yeah . 
UNKNOWN We could have a little L_E_D_s on each end . 
UNKNOWN They only cost pennies . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I appreciate this idea , because then this this will help us in our advertisement also and we can relate with fruits and vegetables , the people's choices . 
UNKNOWN That what our data shows that , so this w this w Uh the fashion trend shows that fruits and vegetables , like people uh now Spongy . 
UNKNOWN Huh ? 
UNKNOWN y I'm I'm not sure about the banana idea . 
UNKNOWN So a spongy banana re Yeah . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Rubber banana . 
UNKNOWN I mean that that th does it does seem a bit uh again childish maybe . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay , okay . 
UNKNOWN I think maybe just drawon the kind of fruit and vegetable shape . 
UNKNOWN And what else did you say about fashions ? 
UNKNOWN What was trendy ? 
UNKNOWN S And sponginess . 
UNKNOWN See So maybe an an unidentifiable fruit or fiable fruit or vegetable like so it would have a stem perhaps and a maybe a it'd be s axially symmetric . 
UNKNOWN And spongy , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Maybe , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Huh . 
UNKNOWN Like what's what's that , I don't even know the name of it , some kind of , you know where it's like looks like a little snowman kind of thing . 
UNKNOWN I don't know the name of that . 
UNKNOWN So it'd look like this kinda . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's what I was thinking . 
UNKNOWN Like a gourd almost , or a squash of some sort ? 
CONFUSION Uh . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , maybe that's what they are . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause that you can hold it in like the bottom bit and Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , and it has a a clear top and bottom so y so you could say , you know , it transmits from this end . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , why the hell not . 
UNKNOWN Let's that'll make us fifty million Euros . 
UNKNOWN I don't know . 
UNKNOWN What do you guy What do you think ? 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Well , I guess it's kind of dra uh you don't necessarily have to have it sort of clearly identified as a fruit just to have that kind of fruitish shape , yeah ? 
NEGATION No . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , then only we can relate it with something . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , we can relate it by advertising or Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Exactly . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so double-curved , single-curved , what do we feel ? 
UNKNOWN Or we can do something , we can design two three shapes and we can have a public survey , let the public choose what they want . 
UNKNOWN Uh-huh . 
UNKNOWN There's a good man . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN There's a good idea . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Okay um , I guess , since you're the marketing guy . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , sure . 
UNKNOWN We'll uh Okay , we could do that . 
UNKNOWN I will be happy to do that . 
CONFUSION Um . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN And buttons would , did we say ? 
UNKNOWN Uh different shapes of buttons ? 
UNKNOWN Um I l I su I mean for the specific functions , you know , up and down , uh play , stop . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so so buttons . 
UNKNOWN They've got , I mean , they've got standard sort of intuitive um things that are always used . 
UNKNOWN Okay , just like that . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN That's cool . 
UNKNOWN I like it . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN With the scroll-wheel or no ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , what about the scroll wheel and speech recognition ? 
UNKNOWN Uh speech recognition , I think , so we need a microphone presumably . 
UNKNOWN Okay uh I could put the microphone here . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Okay there's the microphone . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Where should I put the microphone ? 
UNKNOWN I mean ho h h wel are we sure that scroll wheel does give ease of use ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I'm not sure . 
UNKNOWN Um I mean those ideas I saw were just for inspiration , I think . 
UNKNOWN Glad , we're not doing this for real . 
UNKNOWN Um yeah , I can no I'm not sure . 
UNKNOWN Okay , well we can do some user test with scroll-wheels , right ? 
UNKNOWN I couldn Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN And uh I think if this this new software for the sound recognition is the microphone I would put it sort of sub-centrally , so it's Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So should the microphone be just anywhere on it or 'Kay there's the mic . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So it can be sort of held and w We really need really gonna need to hold it , if it's gonna be voice recognition . 
UNKNOWN That's cool . 
UNKNOWN Um n well we can Whoops . 
UNKNOWN Oops . 
CONFUSION Um . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN So let's not use the whiteboard any more . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Upsidaisy . 
UNKNOWN Oops , sorry . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN And uh so what else was there ? 
UNKNOWN Um the What about the glow-in-the-dark thing , the strip around it ? 
UNKNOWN Are we just gonna leave that ? 
UNKNOWN I s I still like it . 
UNKNOWN Um but that's me . 
UNKNOWN You still like it . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause we've got the uh technological innovation with the speech recognition system . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Yes , or maybe it's just going a bit uh too far . 
UNKNOWN I mean we are pushing it probably with funny fruit shapes . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause um it could Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um don't wanna sort of overkill . 
UNKNOWN Especially with yellow . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN I dunno . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause I mean like uh if we I mean how good is the speech recognition thing ? 
UNKNOWN Do we want to go for buttons at all , do we want to just have a device that maybe sits and pretends it's a fruit ? 
UNKNOWN Then you put it in the fruit bowl ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , you know , and then you just tal I mean like everybody's got fruit bowl in front of the telly . 
UNKNOWN They can work from a You don't have to hold it . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN I it could even encourage healthier habits for television watchers , you know they have uh fruits all round them . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Make them make them think of fruit , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Now just make sure they don't eat the remote . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I mean uh some uh I l like think of a fruit that could sit sort of independently on its own like uh , I dunno , an apple . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , do we need buttons ? 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Then it's just apple so sort of Uh , yellow apples though Hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I quite like the shape . 
UNKNOWN I quite like the design of that , uh 'cause that could sit on its own and it's quite got a quite steady base . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay , yeah , that's good . 
UNKNOWN Groovy . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um and as we say we n we don't wanna be too ridiculous with the fruit things you know . 
UNKNOWN But yeah But yeah , about the speech thing , it doesn't have to be hand held or close . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , . 
UNKNOWN It can sit at a distance and pick it up still . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So I mean like you could actually Yeah , gives you the options . 
UNKNOWN Or we can we can do one thing , we can just have a remote control and casings of different different shapes , different fruit shapes in such a way that a any casing can be could be fit into this mobile general piece . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So whatever people want , like if somebody want it in banana shape , we will put that casing onto that mobile phone , okay , it will look l Uh yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So a selection of casings . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , 'cause you said about disposable , didn't you ? 
UNKNOWN In that w S s sorry ? 
UNKNOWN It kind of fi it fits with f fits with marketing um Like like mobiles , yeah . 
UNKNOWN You said about disposable earli people want disposable things so we could do that , like have a choice . 
UNKNOWN Uh like if this is a like if this is a mobile phone uh we will design casing in such a way like half of , we need not to have a full cover , we will just have a half of cover , okay ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN If somebody wants it i in banana shape , we will fit banana shape casing onto that , so it will give a banana shape look . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN If somebody wanted in apple shape we will design that , we will put we will put apple shape casing on that . 
UNKNOWN It will give apple shape look . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So in that way you can have any , that means whatever you want , without uh yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN We still need the buttons in the same places thought , don't we ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , button will be on the upper side , buttons will be the on the upper side . 
UNKNOWN You can standardise those , I mean . 
UNKNOWN Oh , that's the other side . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , buttons will be on the upper side , lower side we will just put the casing , so half of that will be look the Yeah , not not the upper side . 
CONFIRMATION Oh , okay . 
UNKNOWN Oh , half a fruit . 
CONFIRMATION Oh , okay , okay . 
UNKNOWN So from lower you can , it means while you are holding of from this side you c you can have banana look or apple look , whatever . 
UNKNOWN Okay , okay . 
UNKNOWN So in that way we need not to d have different different shape mobiles everything , we will just design casings fruit shape . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think tho I think if you're gonna have a facia then you'd want to have it so that it does go over the buttons , 'cause when if you think about it if they're wanting it , 'cause they want to look at it , if they're using it , and what they want to look at is facing away from them . 
UNKNOWN And Yeah , . 
UNKNOWN Mm mm . 
UNKNOWN It doesn't really You know 'cause that'd be in the palm of their hand and they wouldn't be able to see it , unless you have sort of you got the buttons options on one side , and you get the facia on the other side with a microphone so that you can place it face down . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And you've got the facia , and you can just talk at the Maybe . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Okay , um so Yeah , s I guess we decided on material , right ? 
UNKNOWN So you've narrowed it down to half a dozen options . 
UNKNOWN So that that spongy latex rubber everything feel , and the colours we got down , and the shape , maybe we'll just make it kinda mix and match type of shape or Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well , um because Well , I I'm not sure if we should go so far in the whole fruit thing , because I think we should maybe just take the inspiration from the fruit and uh because what Yeah , w I think wh wha would we're trying to get to twenty five , thirty five year olds who want it quite trendy as well they said . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so we stick with what we've got there . 
UNKNOWN They wanted something that looks fancy and I think maybe fruit could be a bit of a too much of a gimmick , but something ergonomically shaped and organic , like good to hold , based on fruits and natural things like that , because al already we're going a bit gaudy with the yellow , you know . 
UNKNOWN Mm 'kay . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN I mean we could make it nice pale yellow . 
UNKNOWN Well , it's kind of gotta be our company's yellow . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So again I mean like we could have , uh I mean , we could quite easily have the the main body be a different colour , but have kinda going round , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Maybe we could have that pale yellow and then an outside bit bright yellow with , you said , the logan the slogan . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Because Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um I mean e even if I mean not necessarily that the um the whole body has to be of the company colour , so you know um blue and yellow tend to go to we well together . 
UNKNOWN So you have the main body blue with the yellow logo and slogan running up one side of it kind of thing . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh-huh . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN W sort of Uh It's I think it's basically the more you move i it , it's got a wee thing inside that just kinda powers it . 
CONFIRMATION Great . 
UNKNOWN Um as for the energy source um , you know , almost every remote control uses just batteries , but we don't have to be limited by that . 
UNKNOWN We can use a hand-dynamo . 
UNKNOWN Um I don't know what that means , we crank it ? 
UNKNOWN Right , it's like those watches that you c So , this might be an idea for something that people really wanna grab , you can shake it if it's out of power . 
UNKNOWN Uh yeah . 
UNKNOWN Oh , a d a dynamo ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , like with those watches that you kind of twist . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I like that , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah that's quite cool . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So if it if it's not working , I guess people's natural reaction anyway is to just shake the thing . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN But But but do you think that it will be a good idea to use dynamo , tha these type of cells ? 
UNKNOWN You shake it and scream at it . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , it is , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Because then people have to , well like if the cell is out of bat Yeah , to mo Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It does leave them with an obligation to Especially if they want to use it uh uh sp uh specifically as um voice activated . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , because most of the people Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Then if it's just sitting on the Okay , okay . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Yeah , then they have to pick it up and then activate it and then Yeah . 
UNKNOWN That's true . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Right um what are the other options ? 
UNKNOWN Uh there's solar power . 
UNKNOWN Uh , solar power will w also not be a good idea , because then they have to keep m their mobiles outside in solar energy , and the days when there is no sola sunlight Yeah . 
CONFUSION Um . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I'm I'm with uh Raj on that , I think , you know , I've got I've got no I've got a north facing house , there's not really ever sun coming in my window . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so probably just Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN What we w yeah . 
UNKNOWN But w like just normal light ? 
UNKNOWN I think we should a rechargeable battery will be a good idea . 
UNKNOWN Oh that's true . 
UNKNOWN They can they can recharge it . 
UNKNOWN I mean I w I w uh that idea that I thought um just on the basis of like ridding them of batteries and that kind of bother is having a , yeah , having a rechargeable stand , so that not only it doubles as a stand , but um for using it as uh recharging it , but also for using it as sound recognition . 
UNKNOWN And we're a very environmentally friendly company , aren't we as well ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN Like like a hand like one of those portable phones kind of thing . 
UNKNOWN Yeah that kind of thing . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's Yeah , exactly . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So uh a rechargeable battery . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Rechargeable . 
UNKNOWN Um the user interface , the buttons , I guess we talked about this already . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN . 
UNKNOWN What's chip on print? 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN What's Sorry , never mind . 
UNKNOWN Hmm ? 
UNKNOWN Uh th the uh the electronics um , basically the more features we add um Oops , this one . 
UNKNOWN So the more features we add the fancier chips we need to buy and put in , which adds to the cost as you can expect . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN But uh I think we can keep it all under budget . 
UNKNOWN So uh yes , so the speech thing you said our our techno our research and development department came up with some break-through . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So just in time .

UNKNOWN Tomato ?

UNKNOWN I don't recall a tomato . 
UNKNOWN Oh yeah , well yeah , we had v some red left over . 
UNKNOWN So . 
UNKNOWN Ah I see , okay . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so this is the um non to non uh no buttons one , or as mm few buttons as possible , mainly speak recognition . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN The yellow there is the um the slogan , yeah , that we need to incorporate , it's very simple . 
UNKNOWN Logo . 
UNKNOWN Okay , brilliant . 
UNKNOWN If you do need buttons , you can flip it over , and there's some there , um but mainly it's speech recognition . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so the buttons would be like , you know individual users , or Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah and yeah they might project things onto the screen which you can do on there . 
UNKNOWN Alright , okay . 
UNKNOWN Mm I'm not sure about that . 
UNKNOWN Um and this one is the one w more like the one w that we looked at earlier . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Yeah , you guys can have a look at that if you want . 
UNKNOWN That's groovy . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh can I have Oh sorry s Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Well I like the feel of it , I like the feel of it . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , sure . 
UNKNOWN Um that one is Oh no , it's delicate . 
UNKNOWN At Oh dear . 
UNKNOWN That's that's already got its stand that one . 
UNKNOWN That's it stand . 
UNKNOWN Alright , okay . 
UNKNOWN It does also lie flat , but that's the that yellow stand there represents the the charging stand . 
UNKNOWN Okay , brilliant mm . 
UNKNOWN Um the black on the back is the slogan . 
UNKNOWN Okay , nice and obvious there , if it's standing up , I guess , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh yeah , that Well , we did think of that . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , if it's standing up it's it's on there , but also we're gonna have the company name on the front , which is the little black kind of line in the middle . 
UNKNOWN Oh right , okay , brilliant . 
UNKNOWN Like that from its centre . 
UNKNOWN So um and that's the um transmit the L_E_D_ thing . 
UNKNOWN These are the s two scroll ones which we thought could be channel up and down and volume up and down . 
UNKNOWN We n were weren't sure about putting them there , because um i it's it kind of could get bashed . 
UNKNOWN Where you're , yeah , uh were you're holding it kind of Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well , if you hold it , you can you all can hold it , is it does actually feel quite ergonomic , if you've got small hands . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Um , obviously I don't think that's real sized . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN It would have to be a bit bigger . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , scale model , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um that's a speaker at the top , so you can speak into it like a little walkie-talkie as well for speak recognition . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um and um then the buttons . 
UNKNOWN Yeah kind of self-explanatory , just buttons whenever you need them . 
UNKNOWN Tried to keep it simple . 
UNKNOWN Oh that's the charging base prongs at the bottom . 
UNKNOWN We used those . 
UNKNOWN And um then the big red button in the middle is the on and off one . 
UNKNOWN Alright , excellent . 
UNKNOWN It's not in the traditional place , but um it's quite an obvious place . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN It's out of the way as well , I suppose , so . 
CONFIRMATION Excellent . 
UNKNOWN So there we go and and um we have the banana-based one too . 
UNKNOWN Oh yeah , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN This one is uh , I suppose for the younger audiences . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so so Barney the banana . 
UNKNOWN A a more friendly type of Right , right . 
UNKNOWN It's to uh induce more television watching I suppose or Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Ah excellent , just what we need . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Say it for the camera . 
UNKNOWN Lo Sort of Loch Ness banana . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Right , right . 
UNKNOWN Cool yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well , nice to have uh options at least . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN 'Kay and Oh there are issues , oh there are issues . 
UNKNOWN So are there any um improvements or issues or Oh . 
UNKNOWN It won't stand . 
UNKNOWN Just let it lie down , it wont stand . 
UNKNOWN Um main problem that we have unfortunately being finance . 
UNKNOWN Uh , let's just enter in the um evaluation criteria . 
UNKNOWN Um unfortunately the unit we are currently going to produce minus the extra scroll buttons , uh it's gonna cost us fourteen point six Euros . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN So we have to rea Sorry , I've accidentally highlighted somehow Um . 
UNKNOWN What's on the uh on the left ? 
UNKNOWN There we go . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Oh god , why is it doing that ? 
UNKNOWN Ooh . 
UNKNOWN There we go . 
UNKNOWN So basically , um in order to save our two Euros um I was thinking that we could have essentially the same shape , but just have it flattened . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN More like a traditional remote control . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I mean it's already got a kind of cool shape , so but it wouldn't have to be curved sort of in and out . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN And by doing so Oh no , hold on . 
UNKNOWN Doesn't save us quite as much . 
UNKNOWN I don't know what's going on with this again . 
UNKNOWN W why is the uh double curved two of them ? 
UNKNOWN Oh , good point . 
UNKNOWN And double curve on both sides ? 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Curve . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , this is double-curve , no ? 
UNKNOWN That's sort of curve in and out . 
UNKNOWN This is double-curve . 
UNKNOWN Is i Mm . 
UNKNOWN It This one is single curve . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause this is single curve , this is curved on both sides . 
UNKNOWN So double-curve . 
UNKNOWN No , I think it means double curved as in um like uh a single curve on that bottom half , and the double curved would be if it was that similar curve upward . 
UNKNOWN Like an S_ shape . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Okay , I might be wrong though . 
UNKNOWN Like this , one curve on this side , one curve on that side . 
UNKNOWN I don't think that counts as a curve , I think that's just a shape . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN A curvature is like the this case . 
CONFUSION Maybe . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause that's the uh the biggest expense there , right . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , and why why I've got it two , I don't know , I can't seem to select any more however . 
UNKNOWN got two of them Okay . 
UNKNOWN Well we can work around that um Cut things out . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN But you think it should be one . 
UNKNOWN It's meant to be one , yeah , I don't know why I put two in there , but um Hold on till I find it , I think this shift button might be stuck again . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN No maybe the shift button's stuck in . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um okay , so that would take away three , which would give us Oh that's fine . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Should Uh you can do one thing . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , so we're We should fire the accountants . 
UNKNOWN Eleven uh eleven Euros sixty . 
CONFIRMATION Cool . 
CONFIRMATION Cool . 
UNKNOWN Um We cou Oh not quite , have the scroll-wheel , unfortunately . 
UNKNOWN So we could even add something . 
UNKNOWN What ? 
UNKNOWN Fire the accountants . 
UNKNOWN Ah yeah , we could add things . 
UNKNOWN Maybe if you click back in that bottom right cell , where you're starting from , and then use the arrow keys . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Does that work ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I know , that just extends it as well . 
UNKNOWN No mm . 
UNKNOWN I don't know . 
UNKNOWN You just select one box outsi yeah , this box . 
UNKNOWN Then move it with the help of this Okay . 
UNKNOWN It One of the buttons is sticking , I don't know . 
UNKNOWN Just uh just uh Okay , just a minute. 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN No input , like this . 
UNKNOWN Shift . 
UNKNOWN No it's not . 
UNKNOWN No , it's 'cause the uh the shift button's stuck , or something . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , it's not working . 
UNKNOWN Is it the other shift button maybe ? 
UNKNOWN Should we ask Meli Should we ask our technical expert Melissa ? 
UNKNOWN No that's fine . 
UNKNOWN Um we've worked out what it would be anyway . 
UNKNOWN Did you try both shift buttons ? 
UNKNOWN It could be the other side . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Cancel . 
UNKNOWN Piss off . 
UNKNOWN That's too bad . 
UNKNOWN Oh well , never mind . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Right , so that's finances and I dunno what we what could we reckon we could add ? 
UNKNOWN Um Well I suppose that's our that's that's our design that we've got . 
UNKNOWN Well maybe we could add something , but maybe if What do you th We're trying to save money , so . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , if we're happy with the design there's no point in spending money , if we don't have to . 
UNKNOWN So Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But if there is anything you think we've missed out there , then , you know , feel free to add it . 
UNKNOWN Maybe I mean obviously it would be bigger so there might be more space for the the slogan on the front , because it's not in an ideal place right now . 
UNKNOWN Yeah yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well that's that's uh Okay , so project evaluation . 
UNKNOWN We have under twelve Euros fifty . 
UNKNOWN Project process , how do we think that went ? 
UNKNOWN Are we happy ? 
SURPRISE Oh .

UNKNOWN Uh room for creativity , were we happy with that ? 
UNKNOWN W I think we were very creative . 
UNKNOWN No , I mea I think it means sort of individually .

CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Oh could you pass the tomato please . 
UNKNOWN So . 
UNKNOWN Sorry . 
THANKS Thank you . 
UNKNOWN So now is the final evaluation , final evaluation of the uh uh of our product . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN How we are going to means uh at what standard what standard whether it meets our standards or not . 
UNKNOWN How mu What rating we will give to these products . 
UNKNOWN So of course this is will be a team work , w we together have to decide wha what rating we will give to this product and everything . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So what methodology I will tell you on what basis we are going to discuss all this . 
UNKNOWN We will give the rating to this product based on the user requirements , whether it meets the user requirements or not , this product . 
UNKNOWN Then trends , whether it is as fashion trends or not ? 
UNKNOWN Means because we have already stated that people do prefer fashionable things nowadays . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So this is also an important factor for our evaluation also . 
UNKNOWN Then marketing strategy of the company . 
UNKNOWN As we have already discussed that our company is quite in the market , not only in terms of providing quality products , not only in pro providing latest technologies , but also in terms of providing environmental s Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Sorry . 
UNKNOWN Sorry , carry on . 
UNKNOWN So but also in terms of providing environmental safe products , uh yeah like uh keeping uh keeping in mind all the safety issues . 
UNKNOWN So Now comes the criteria rating with seven point scale . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN I'm having this scale this scale , so we have to do it on a board . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Alright , okay . 
UNKNOWN The board working again , is it ? 
UNKNOWN the user requirem I think . 
UNKNOWN Do we have the uh the marker for the board ? 
CONFUSION Um . 
CONFUSION Uh . 
UNKNOWN There it is . 
THANKS Thank you . 
UNKNOWN So . 
UNKNOWN So these are the three crite criterias for our evaluation of our product . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN First of all uh comes user requirement . 
UNKNOWN So we will see whether this product meets all user requirements or not . 
UNKNOWN I I will first I would like to have your views , what do you think whether it meets all user requirements or not ? 
UNKNOWN Um I think Yeah , it did . 
UNKNOWN It had all the basic buttons that they needed as well as the uh new technology that people said they wanted . 
UNKNOWN S So what do you think you will personally give . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um so . 
UNKNOWN When the user requirement is essentially just to operate the T_V_ , so yeah , of course we haven't actually got a working model yet . 
UNKNOWN Does it work ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So . 
UNKNOWN I would say seven . 
UNKNOWN Seven . 
CONFUSION Uh . 
UNKNOWN Seven is good , yeah , isn't it ? 
UNKNOWN I can't True or false ? 
UNKNOWN No sorry tr one is true . 
UNKNOWN One , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh one is means highest ranking , okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But I think highest ranking is seven , or one ? 
UNKNOWN No it's it's like true is one end , and false is the oth Oh , I'll go for a one . 
UNKNOWN No that's false . 
UNKNOWN Okay , right right . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so one . 
UNKNOWN So it's one for from your point of view . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN And what do you say our Industrial Expert ? 
CONFUSION Uh . 
UNKNOWN It's hard to know . 
UNKNOWN I I give it a two . 
UNKNOWN Uh d you can you can tell on on the like I think she has given her views on the basis of design , because she was our i Interface Expert . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN But you can give your views based on technology , whether the technology meets the requirements of the customers or not ? 
UNKNOWN Um yeah , I think i it might even exceed it um . 
UNKNOWN But I guess there is a kind of a shortage of buttons . 
UNKNOWN Um I'm gonna give it a two . 
UNKNOWN Two . 
UNKNOWN Two . 
UNKNOWN And what about uh you , Brian ? 
UNKNOWN You will go for one . 
UNKNOWN Basic requirements but of the pro of the project . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Uh for me personally it is everything fine , it may be having good design , it may be uh meeting all the requirements of the customers like technology-wise , price-wise , but there is one thing which limits the customers , like we are having only two , three designs, like we are having one banana design and the other one is orange , and Uh yeah , lower end . 
UNKNOWN Mm yellow . 
UNKNOWN Yeah th Come on that was the tha 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN And the third one is what you ge uh that is not a f fruit look . 
UNKNOWN Uh-huh . 
UNKNOWN But if a person doesn't like banana , or orange , you are limiting him . 
UNKNOWN Uh-huh . 
UNKNOWN No , don't buy our product , because we are l we like this only . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So we are showing our preference for particular fruits , two or three kinds rather , and Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Being fruitist . 
UNKNOWN Is that no is that not trends ? 
UNKNOWN So . 
UNKNOWN Uh no , uh personally as a Marketing Expert I don't believe that , because whatever companies they launch their products in the shape of fruits , they give a range of products , a range of shapes , like if we see , look at the smallest thing , toffee chocolates , they give a variety of different things . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Some children like to buy banana shape , some apple shape , some even pineapple shape , some orange shape . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So you can what shape a person will like . 
UNKNOWN So in this case giving only one or two choices we are lim limiting our customers . 
UNKNOWN And by limiting them , we are limiting our sales , limiting our profit also . 
UNKNOWN Uh-huh . 
UNKNOWN But in electronics , I think , it's not q always quite so um you don't always have so many choices as with chocolates . 
UNKNOWN I think , you know , if you're going to buy a T_V_ maybe a company'll have That you're going to choose from , a company'll have two or three choices , but they're different designs. 
UNKNOWN We were coming up with one product . 
UNKNOWN Uh maybe . 
UNKNOWN Okay but I will I will personally won't give it beyond three . 
UNKNOWN No , I mean uh obviously your opinion , I'm just trying to Okay . 
UNKNOWN So we can Yeah , on an average we can think three , four sevenths , maybe . 
UNKNOWN He's a tough cookie . 
UNKNOWN Three or four ? 
UNKNOWN Uh , no sorry , it should be No sorry , sorry , sorry , sorry , we are doing a very wrong thing . 
UNKNOWN Six . 
UNKNOWN Five or six . 
UNKNOWN What are we doing ? 
UNKNOWN What are we doing ? 
UNKNOWN Adding them up ? 
UNKNOWN We're gonna average them ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah , we are taking everything , and that's I have taken it very wrongly . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN So seven fourths . 
UNKNOWN Yeah uh three four four two six seven seven sev Yeah one pe exactly . 
UNKNOWN About one point f one point eight . 
UNKNOWN So we can say one or two . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN because it is one point eight uh two , so we will do two . 
UNKNOWN Oh I see . 
UNKNOWN Yeah round it up to two . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay , yeah . 
UNKNOWN So where were the trends . 
UNKNOWN So trends . 
UNKNOWN Can you explain what you want us to write there ? 
CONFUSION Sorry ? 
UNKNOWN How it how conforms to the current trends ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , again the the fashion trends , this also like whether it it will be fashionable to have these products in the uh as a fruit shape or something . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFUSION Uh . 
UNKNOWN Well um going on uh the specifications that we had , that fruit and vegetables are quite popular , and that people like something that is good to look at and not many buttons , I would give it um , well , because it's hard to make a fruit good to look at , that that looks cool , you know , so I would actually give it a three . 
UNKNOWN Tha three or four , I'm not sure . 
UNKNOWN Three . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Go for three . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION That's fine . 
UNKNOWN Uh Okay . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN As far as the uh technology it its' got the latest trends in speech technology , but it's missing the screen , as we said , um but it does have the push-buttons , or the scroll-buttons , um but it doesn't have that fancy solar power or the the vibrating energy mechanism . 
UNKNOWN So I give it a a four . 
UNKNOWN I'd give it a kinda middle of the road for for technology . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I am sort of pret uh Just the fruit does me in , I mean uh it might it might be trendy to some , but I'm just not swallowing the fruit , so um Uh also uh I would have liked to have seen the L_C_D_ screen in it . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um so yeah I'd say about four as well . 
UNKNOWN Uh personally I wi uh I think that in terms of trends , these products are quite good , like , these products are in fruit shape , because that wha people now our fashion trend shows that people like everything all f everything that is being advertised , like clothes , shoes , and everything is being advertised in the form of fruits and vegetables , or getting them or showing some association with them . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So and in this way our product is good . 
UNKNOWN And the second thing , now people don't want any complicated or bulky products and ours is quite simple and quite handy . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So that is also ef that also Our product meets the f the fashion uh trends of the market . 
UNKNOWN And yes . 
UNKNOWN It is cus spongy also . 
UNKNOWN So they can play with it , it's quite good . 
UNKNOWN So then I think , maybe I can give it two . 
UNKNOWN So four five ten thirteen thirteen . 
UNKNOWN So we can Is it fine ? 
UNKNOWN So what about company strategy ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Well it was yellow . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , the company strategy , okay . 
UNKNOWN Um there was lot of discussing , that was good . 
UNKNOWN Um I feel I got my say . 
UNKNOWN Um so I'd give the company strategy a two . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Well , I think it's the the remote control conforms to the the company strategy . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Is that the question ? 
UNKNOWN Is it ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so one or two . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN One . 
UNKNOWN Okay , just leave it , it's fine . 
UNKNOWN I'll go with two . 
UNKNOWN So what about you , Brian ? 
UNKNOWN Um yeah , a three . 
UNKNOWN Pretty much kept to the company strategy , so I would go for a a one , as we not only kept it , but we were limited by Cool , groovy . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , and me also , like , this product me uh me uh me uh this meets all company strategy like our product should be as per customers' requirement , as per latest technology , and it should be environmental safe . 
UNKNOWN So since our product meets all these requirements , so I would also prefer to give it rank one . 
UNKNOWN So four six six half . 
UNKNOWN So one and a half . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , one . 
UNKNOWN So we can say two or one Okay . 
UNKNOWN A two . 
UNKNOWN So th seven seven . 
UNKNOWN Uh overall we are getting two something , but we can round it as two . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So I think overall uh evaluation of our product is quite good . 
UNKNOWN S Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Cool . 
UNKNOWN So we can launch it . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Brilliant . 
UNKNOWN Woo-hoo . 
UNKNOWN In which case we are done . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause we've evaluated and we are within budget . 
CONFIRMATION Cool . 
UNKNOWN So yeah . 
UNKNOWN Champagne lunch anyone ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Uh . 
CONFIRMATION Great . 
UNKNOWN .. . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So , this is uh first meeting of this design project . 
UNKNOWN Um and I um like to show you the agendafor the meeting , I don't know if it was sent round to all of you . 
UNKNOWN Mm , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Maybe not . 
UNKNOWN I didn't receive it yet . 
UNKNOWN Anyway , this is the the plan for today's meeting is um firstly just to introduce the project briefly , um although I'm sure you've actually got some of the information already . 
UNKNOWN Then the main purpose is to so that we get to know each other a little bit more . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um then we want to practice using some of the tools that we'll be using during the the course of the design project and the meetings , um specifically the whiteboard over there . 
UNKNOWN Um then we need to go through the specifics of our project plan um and discuss come up with some preliminary ideas about it . 
UNKNOWN And then that's it . 
UNKNOWN So we've got twenty five minutes to do that , that's until eleven twenty five . 
UNKNOWN S so any any questions ? 
UNKNOWN so sh . 
UNKNOWN Is i not at this point . 
UNKNOWN Not at this point . 
UNKNOWN So this is our project . 
UNKNOWN What we're aiming to do is to create a new remote control for a television . 
UNKNOWN Um we want it to be something original , something trendy and also something user friendly , so it has to be quite intuitive that people are able to use this product . 
UNKNOWN The method that we're going to use to complete the project , that has three components as such . 
UNKNOWN There's the functional design of the the remote control . 
UNKNOWN We're going the way we'll do that I think is to to work individually initially and then come together for meetings to to work on that . 
UNKNOWN Um similarly with the conceptual design , we'll start off by working individually with our own expertise on our own laptops and then we'll bring what we've done together . 
UNKNOWN Um and then the detailed design will come after that . 
UNKNOWN We'll pull it all together . 
UNKNOWN I'm a bit confused about uh what's the difference between the functional design and conceptual design ? 
UNKNOWN Uh i is it just uh more detail , uh as I understand it ? 
UNKNOWN I think it th w we're talking the the functional design is more your um area of things where you'll be we want to look at what functions we need in the remote control and what what specific things it it has to do but the conceptual design is um perhaps bigger than that and includes the how people are going to use it and and that kind of thing . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN How how it will be done . 
UNKNOWN So whe where do we identify the components of our uh product ? 
UNKNOWN Uh I think it's it's in the conceptual design phase that we identify the it's in the conceptual design phase that we identify the components of our product ? 
UNKNOWN Um I think we'll we'll start that initially with the functional design already but then yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so that's just a brief overview of the p the the project itself . 
UNKNOWN Um what I'd like us to do now is simultaneously introduce ourselves and start using some of the tools that we're using for for the project , specifically the whiteboard . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN So each person in turn , I'd like us to go up to the whiteboard , the pen's just underneath it there and drawyour favourite animal and then tell everyone what the f your favourite characteristics of that animal are and while you're doing that tell us your name , what your role is and perhaps how your animal relates to the role that you're taking in this project . 
UNKNOWN Why are you looking at me ? 
UNKNOWN Would you like to go first ? 
UNKNOWN Do I have a choice ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Ooh ooh , things falling everywhere . 
UNKNOWN Oh , yeah , p put them in pockets . 
UNKNOWN Right , okay . 
CONFIRMATION Cool . 
UNKNOWN You don't have to hurry , we've got plenty of time . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So , my name's Cat and I'm really not very good at this whole drawingmalarkey so um Okay . 
UNKNOWN It's got no eyes . 
UNKNOWN Oh , good point . 
UNKNOWN Ah , the eyes always ruin it . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Okay , what do it's eyes like ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay , cool . 
UNKNOWN Um this is a rabbit . 
UNKNOWN I thought it might be a cat . 
UNKNOWN Yeah well origi uh at first I thought it was going to be cat . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I don't think it's furry enough , so we'll make it a fluffy rabbit . 
UNKNOWN Yeah now I now I understand now , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah I can see by the ears . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay , right , it's a fluffy rabbit , blue . 
UNKNOWN Rabbits don't come in blue but you know . 
UNKNOWN Um okay and I like it because it's small and it's fluffy . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN And one day you'll be able to getical genetically modify them and they will come in pink . 
UNKNOWN Ah . 
UNKNOWN Okay ? 
UNKNOWN Excellent , and what's your what's your role within the team ? 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN I am the um I need my notebook , mm ooh top banana . 
THANKS Thank you . 
UNKNOWN Okay , cool , I am the Marketing Expert um so like I'm gonna be doing the apparently according to the little guy in the computer that knows everything the user g requirements specification of the functional design , um trend watching in the conceptual design and product evad-valuation in the detailed design um so yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN And more about yourself , you're from ? 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN Um I'm from Leicester , um second year . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um what else do you want to know ? 
UNKNOWN I like sports um yeah , aerobics , kickboxing , spinning um and uh not with rabbits , no no . 
UNKNOWN But not with rabbits . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN And vets , I like vets as well . 
UNKNOWN And yeah um and I like cocktails , especially pink ones . 
UNKNOWN Okay ? 
CONFIRMATION Cool . 
UNKNOWN Excellent , to match the rabbit . 
CONFIRMATION Cool . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um so my name is Maarika . 
UNKNOWN Where's the pen ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN There's a an if you have not enough room there's an eraser there and you can rub it off . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , well , or I can make it smaller . 
UNKNOWN Uh so um um I'm the Interface Designer in this project and my favourite animal , I m I mean I'm not so sure because I'm not so so very um familiar with all kinds of animals , but I do like dogs . 
UNKNOWN Oh , sorry , maybe I should have shouldn't have said it beforehand but mm hmm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Um well , there are different kinds of dogs , but okay um . 
UNKNOWN That's not bad at all . 
UNKNOWN Ah it looks like a dog . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Is a bit more impressive than my rabbit . 
UNKNOWN I think it needs four legs if it's gonna walk though . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , maybe it has some colourful patches , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um yeah and I do like dogs because they are good friends to people and they are loyal . 
UNKNOWN the other legs are on the other side . 
UNKNOWN Mm , well that's compared to some other animals like cats . 
UNKNOWN Um they're really much more fun because they are not so independent . 
UNKNOWN Um yeah maybe maybe the fact that they protect their home as well , yeah . 
UNKNOWN . 
UNKNOWN Um what it has to do with with my role in the project is hard to say . 
UNKNOWN Uh I hope to be loyal to the project and not to n not to um let people doing similar projects know the details of our project or something , yeah . 
UNKNOWN And where where are you from ? 
UNKNOWN I'm from Estonia uh , yep . 
UNKNOWN Estonia . 
UNKNOWN Um so is there anything else you'd like to know ? 
UNKNOWN Oh , right , my roles , um so um in the different um stages of the design , so at first I will be responsible for um for yeah , designing the technical functions of the um um of the remote control uh then in the in the conceptual design stage I need to um come up with uh interface concept and then in the last um stage I will be responsible for the int infa for the user interface design . 
UNKNOWN . 
UNKNOWN . 
UNKNOWN Okay , that's it . 
THANKS Thank you . 
UNKNOWN Okay um I'll do some I'll rub the features and let the drawingstay . 
UNKNOWN 'Kay um my name is Gaurav . 
UNKNOWN Um my favourite animal one of my favourite animals is a cow . 
UNKNOWN I've got no idea how to drawa cow . 
UNKNOWN Good luck . 
UNKNOWN Uh this is going to be Yeah , that'll do . 
UNKNOWN They're not just like a big round body and then some really skinny legs and then just some horns . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so let let me drawthe body first . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Big , round body , really skinny legs and they've got a long tail and a long face . 
UNKNOWN It's eating . 
UNKNOWN It looks like Eeyore . 
UNKNOWN And there is some grass there . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So this is what I like about cows that they just keeps sitting there eating grass , they do not disturb anybody um they're kind of Buddhist in a way . 
UNKNOWN Horns , drawsome horns . 
UNKNOWN So yeah , I like cows . 
UNKNOWN Um my my role in the project is um uh the industrial designer , so I'm supposed to design all the details of of the product um ho how it works and whatever it'll mm take during the functional role , what are the various functions that have to be performed by it uh during the um conceptual design , what are the various components of it and um finally , I'm not too sure what was the last part . 
UNKNOWN Um the detailed design , I I guess it will again be the identification of the components and how they integrate with each other . 
UNKNOWN Um I'm from India . 
UNKNOWN Uh I'm doing my P_H_D_ in Psycholinguistics , I sit at the Department of Psychology . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Excellent . 
THANKS Thank you . 
CONFIRMATION Thanks . 
UNKNOWN Right , now now it's my turn obviously . 
UNKNOWN Okay , here's a space . 
UNKNOWN That doesn't look like a cow , does it ? 
UNKNOWN It looks very very cute . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I like the cow . 
UNKNOWN I'm Jen . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um I like dogs too , but I can't do that already because I can't drawa dog as well as you can . 
UNKNOWN I like Mm . 
UNKNOWN Is that a lizard ? 
UNKNOWN No way . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Wow . 
UNKNOWN It's a gecko . 
UNKNOWN Ah , a gecko , okay . 
UNKNOWN Ah okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Is there a difference ? 
UNKNOWN Is a ar are they also like lizards or are they yeah , they are mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN They're Yeah , they're l it's a kind of lizard . 
UNKNOWN And I I like geckos because they remind me of warm places and , and where I was living in Cambodia they used to live in my house and they were on the ceiling and they would make little gecko noises in the evening . 
UNKNOWN Ah . 
UNKNOWN Uh-huh . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN I hope you don't like snakes , do you ? 
UNKNOWN I don't like snakes . 
UNKNOWN I come from Australia and we have nasty snakes . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN That's where I'm from , Australia . 
UNKNOWN I'm from Melbourne and I'm your Project Manager for today and my role is basically to keep things going and make sure that you all work together in a productive way , so that by the end of the day we come up with a great product . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Wonderful . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
THANKS Thank you . 
UNKNOWN So , let's see what's next in the PowerPointpresentation. 
UNKNOWN So , I've just thought yeah I've just thought about this that we could even put it much more professionally as there we go . 
UNKNOWN If you right click on it you can Yeah , I was looking at the website , and the other things that they've made and I like put down some like inspirational words like that I got from looking at the pictures . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so this is the um overall budget for our project . 
UNKNOWN We've got um we're planning to sell these remote controls for let's make that go away , that means we've got five minutes . 
UNKNOWN Um we're planning to sell the remote controls for twenty five Euros each . 
UNKNOWN Um and with that we're aiming for a profit of fifty million Euros . 
UNKNOWN And that's selling them on the international market , not just in the U_K_ . 
UNKNOWN Um so to do that our finance people estimate that we need production costs of maximum twelve and a half Euro so that we can reach that profit target . 
UNKNOWN So that's something to keep in mind while you're designing . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN This is let me just skip ahead to see that's the last thing , okay . 
UNKNOWN We've only got a couple of minutes . 
UNKNOWN Does anyone have any first ideas to bounce around about um what we're thinking of this remote control ? 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN I'm just wondering whether whether there is like any special feature that we want to have w want this remote control have as opposed to the already existing ones . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN I think that's probably something that w it's best if we take away with us , but if we all have a think , when we go away from the meeting , what specific things could be um included in this remote control that that are out of the ordinary . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN I think uh i in the beginning uh one thing was that was mentioned was that it should be mm trendy , user friendly and original so um I think your point is relevant as far as the originality is concerned , that we should provide some features that are quite unique to this . 
UNKNOWN Something something new . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So the motto is um we put the fashion in electronics and um so it's something that is sleek and stylish but it's still functional , you know ? 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So I'm kind of thinking , you know like those phones that they have , the new generation ones , where they don't actually have any buttons on them and stuff like that . 
UNKNOWN Uh-huh . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
UNKNOWN You know , so something heading towards that , so it's not overly I mean I don't know what h most of the buttons do on my remote controls , so I figure how many do you need , you know ? 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So perhaps some sort of menu-based thing , or Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Something that's a little less crowded than this , like I mean you know , theoretically you can do all kinds of things with your T_V_ , right ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But what do most people do ? 
UNKNOWN They turn it on , they watch certain specified channels , you know , and then they turn it off again . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN There is a lot of functionality in there that is not used ninety percent of the time , but will be used ten percent of the time , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Sometimes they play a movie . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , so there's no need to have buttons on it to do that , maybe to do Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So , no . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN It could be one button for a menu or something , if you really need to go and do that . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN And then use the Mm . 
UNKNOWN So , if you're the kind of sad case that knows how your remote control works , then you know that's fine and you can do it on the screen rather than everybody else having to have those buttons , which just confuse them . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Excellent . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause like if you look at the train , it's just very like , there's no extra bits on it , the train on the website and I dunno if you can put it up on the thing um but it is just like a long like thing used for mu moving people , but it looks really pretty too . 
UNKNOWN Oh I haven't had a look yet , yep . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Great . 
UNKNOWN Any other immediate thoughts before we move along ? 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Uh we can aim for I mean we can think about all these little things , but we can aim for something wi that gives a high battery life , although I don't think that um it's a huge problem for remote controls anyway , battery life , uh every now and then you need to replace the batteries . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah but uh I mean e even though it has to be re original we shouldn't uh go like too far away from from the usual ones , because otherwise the new users will just have a lot of problems with l learning , yeah , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN A big learning curve , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So , i it should kind of fit in as well , and the stereotype of a yeah . 
UNKNOWN It's like those fancy websites that you can't access because you have no idea how to get in , but the designers thought they were great . 
UNKNOWN Hm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so we need to wrap it up now , so that we can go away and get on with some of this . 
UNKNOWN Um we've got another meeting in thirty minutes , so you're you'll be getting specific instructions once you go back to your workspace , but im basically you're looking at the working design , you're looking at the technical functions design , and for you it's the user requirements specification , like you said at the start . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Okay ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Thanks for that . 
THANKS Thank you . 
UNKNOWN Uh I'll see you in half an hour . 
UNKNOWN See you . 
UNKNOWN . 
UNKNOWN Carry the laptops back again . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Do we need to unplug things ? 
UNKNOWN Probably . 
UNKNOWN All hooked up . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so now we are here at the functional design meeting . 
UNKNOWN Um hopefully this meeting I'll be doing a little bit less talking than I did last time 'cause this is when you get to show us what you've been doing individually . 
UNKNOWN The agendafor the meeting , I put it in the sh shared documentsfolder . 
UNKNOWN I don't know if that meant that you could see it or not . 
UNKNOWN Did anyone ? 
NEGATION No . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN Oh well . 
UNKNOWN Um I'll try and do that for the next meeting as well so if you check in there , there's a shared project documentsfolder . 
UNKNOWN Um and it should be in there . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Um um wi on on a what ? 
UNKNOWN Oh project project documents, yeah , yeah , yeah , okay . 
UNKNOWN Project documents, yeah . 
UNKNOWN So I'll put it in there . 
UNKNOWN Oh okay , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Is it best if I send you an emailmaybe , to let you know it's there ? 
UNKNOWN Yes , I think so . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN I'll do that next time . 
UNKNOWN Um I'll act as secretary for this meeting and just take minutesas we go through , and then I'll send them to you after the meeting . 
UNKNOWN The main the main focus of this meeting is your presentationsthat you've been preparing during the time , so we'll go through each of you one by one . 
UNKNOWN Um then we need to briefly discuss the new project requirements that were sent to us . 
UNKNOWN I just sent at the last minute, I'm sorry about that , but we can see how that affects what you were you were doing . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , the last minute, yeah , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um and then we need to , by the end of the meeting come to some kind of decision on who our target group's going to be and what the functions of the remote control that's the the main goal is to come up with those two things , target group and functions of the remote control . 
UNKNOWN And we've got forty minutes to do that in . 
UNKNOWN So I would say yeah ? 
UNKNOWN You said uh targ target groups , what does that mean ? 
UNKNOWN As uh who it is that we're going to be trying to sell this thing to , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um Okay . 
UNKNOWN Uh okay , 'kay . 
UNKNOWN So are Okay . 
UNKNOWN So we need to yeah , we need to have a fairly defined group that that we want to focus on and then look at the functions um of the dem remote control itself . 
UNKNOWN So with that I think it's best if I hand over to you . 
UNKNOWN Does anyone have a preference for going first ? 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
UNKNOWN I can go first , yeah . 
UNKNOWN You wanna go first ? 
UNKNOWN Okay , so we need to unplug my laptop and plug in yours . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN I assume we just pull it out ? 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Um so f from the Right sure . 
UNKNOWN Just before you start , to make it easier , would you three mind emailing me your presentations? 
UNKNOWN Once we you don't have to do it now but when once you go back , just so that I don't have to scribble everything down . 
UNKNOWN Okay , yeah , afterwards , yeah , okay . 
UNKNOWN Uh okay . 
UNKNOWN So n uh with uh with regard to the uh working design of this uh uh remote control uh I've identified um a few basic uh components of the remote and uh se uh from the design , functional design perspective um w I c we can now uh know wha what exactly the components are and how how they work together with each other . 
UNKNOWN So this is the method that uh I'll mostly be following in my um in my uh role . 
UNKNOWN Um the identification of the components , uh and uh since since I'm dealing only with the technical aspects , I would need feedback from the marketing person uh and uh from the user interface person . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Uh we'll then integrate this into the product design at a technical level and uh basically update and come up with a new design , so it's a cyclical process . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so these were the basic findings from today . 
UNKNOWN The last three bullets have been integrated from uh the last minuteuh email. 
UNKNOWN Uh I just quickly jotted them down . 
UNKNOWN Um so basically uh the as I told you the identification of how the remote control works and what are the various parts to it uh and what are the different processes um and how the parts uh communicate with each other . 
UNKNOWN Um okay , so e the mee emailsaid that teletext is now outdated , so we need to do away with that functionality of the remote control . 
UNKNOWN Um also uh the remote control should be used only for television , because incorporating other features um makes it more comp complex . 
UNKNOWN And the reason why teletext is outdated because uh of internet and uh the availability of internet over television . 
UNKNOWN How however , our our remote control would only be dealing uh with the the use for television , in order to keep things simple . 
UNKNOWN Um also the management wants that um our design should be unique uh it so it should incorporate um colour and the slogan uh that our company um has it as its standard . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so he he here is a functional overview of the remote control . 
UNKNOWN Um there's basically an energy source at the heart uh which feeds into the chip and the user interface . 
UNKNOWN The user interf interface communicates with the chip , so I'll basic go over to the Okay . 
UNKNOWN So if uh if this is our energy source and this is a cell , uh it communicates uh it feeds energy into the into the chip , which basically finds out h uh how how to do everything . 
UNKNOWN There is a user interface here . 
UNKNOWN So whe when the user presses a button , it feeds into the chip and the chip then generates a response and takes the response to an infrared terminal , um which then so the output of the chip is an infrared bit code , which is then communicated to the remote site , which h has an infrared receiver . 
UNKNOWN Um the there can be uh a bulb here or something to indicate whether the remote is on or communicating . 
UNKNOWN Um so these are the essent so a all the functionality of the remote control , whatever new functions that we need to do , um make the chip more complicated uh and bigger , basically . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um so i in my personal preferences um I'm hoping that we can ke keep the design as simple and clear as possible . 
UNKNOWN This would uh help us uh to upgrade our technology at a future point of time . 
UNKNOWN And uh also if we can incorporate uh the latest features in our chip design , so that our um uh remote control does not become outdated soon and it's compatible with mot most uh televisions . 
UNKNOWN That's about it . 
UNKNOWN So anything that you would like to know or No , I don't have any idea about what each component costs . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Thanks . 
UNKNOWN Do you have any um i idea about costs at this point ? 
UNKNOWN Br Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um yeah . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause that's something to consider , I guess , if we're if we're using more advanced technology , it might increase the price . 
UNKNOWN Anything else ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Certainly , yeah . 
UNKNOWN So so tha yeah , we definitely need to operate within our constraints , but um unfortunately I I do not have any data , so uh I just identified the functional components for that . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION That's fine . 
UNKNOWN Are there any more questions , or shall we just skip straight to the next one and then we can discuss all of them together at the end ? 
UNKNOWN I think we need like some general discussion at the end probably . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I think that will do . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so do you want to Yes , shall shall we pull this up ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I think since since we were discussing some um design issues then I I I would like to continue okay , yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think that has to come out of there . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Mm 'kay . 
CONFIRMATION Thanks . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I thought those last minutethings , they're gonna hit you the worst . 
UNKNOWN Oh i Okay , I hope wait . 
UNKNOWN Should it just There's just nothing . 
UNKNOWN I it'll take some time . 
UNKNOWN It ta takes a little Oh , and have you you need to then also press on yours , function F_ eight , so the blue function key at the bottom and F_ eight . 
UNKNOWN Oh right , right , right , um Okay . 
UNKNOWN Nothin okay , something is coming up . 
UNKNOWN Oh , there it is , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Now it's coming , computer no signal . 
UNKNOWN It'll come up , it um uh no signal . 
UNKNOWN No signal ? 
UNKNOWN Why ? 
UNKNOWN Maybe again ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah yeah , it says something now , adjusting Okay . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN My my computer went blank now . 
UNKNOWN Okay , adjusting . 
UNKNOWN Adjusting . 
UNKNOWN But I don't see anything I don't see anything on my computer now . 
UNKNOWN There we go , there we go . 
UNKNOWN This is the problem , but Um . 
UNKNOWN Oh , that's strange . 
UNKNOWN Oh , if you press if you press function and that again there's there's usually three modes , one where it's only here , one where it's only there , and one where it's both . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN And one more time . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so one more time . 
UNKNOWN Uh now it's okay . 
UNKNOWN No ? 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN Should yeah just wait for a moment , adjusting . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Oh okay . 
UNKNOWN Okay , that's fine , that's good . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Okay , let's start from the beginning . 
UNKNOWN So I'm going to speak about technical functions design uh just like some some first issues that came up . 
UNKNOWN Um 'kay , so the method I was um adopting at this point , it's not um for the for the whole um period of the um all the project but it's just at th at this very moment . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um uh my method was um to look at um other um remote controls , uh so mostly just by searching on the web and to see what um functionality they used . 
UNKNOWN And then um after having got this inspiration and having compared what I found on the web um just to think about what the de what the user really needs and what um what the user might desire as additional uh functionalities . 
UNKNOWN And yeah , and then just to um put the main function of the remote control in in words . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um so the findings uh were um that the main function of the remote control is is just sending messages to the television set , so this quite straightforward . 
UNKNOWN And uh w some of the main functions would be switching on , switching off , uh then the user would like to switch the channel um for example just m changing to the next channel to to flip through all all of the possible channels , or then mm uh the other possibility would be that um she might just want to choose one particular channel , so we would need the numbers . 
UNKNOWN And and also the volume is very important . 
UNKNOWN Um um I als okay . 
UNKNOWN Sorry , cou could you go back for a second ? 
UNKNOWN Uh switching on off channel , uh volume , okay , that's great . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN Um um among the findings I found that m m most of the curr mm presently available remote controls also include other mm functionalities um in their design , like operating a V_C_R_ , but they don't seem to be able to deal with D_V_D_ players , but then there are surely there are many other functionali functions that could possibly be added to them , but according to the last minuteupdate um actually um we do not want to have all this complicated functions added to our design . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So my personal preferences would be uh to keep the mm the whole remote control small um just like the physical size . 
UNKNOWN And then it must be easy to use , so it must follow some conventions um like whereabouts you find the on off button and maybe the colour tends to be red or something . 
UNKNOWN Um then yeah , the must-have buttons would be on off and then the channel numbers and then um the one that allows us to go to the next or the previous channel , and then volume has to be there . 
UNKNOWN But then um other functionalities um could be just uh there could be a menu button and you could change things on the screen then , um for example brightness and mm similar functions could be just um done through the menu . 
UNKNOWN And yeah , the last question I had about whether we wanted to incorporate n uh more functionalities , the answer was already no because of the last minuteupdate . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So at the for the time being that's uh that's all . 
UNKNOWN If you have questions Yeah , and also it's it's um other question is uh because there are so many different And there are so many different things that could possibly be included because besides video and D_V_D_ there are the mm um video C_D_s and whatever , so it might be problematic to to choose between all these possible things . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN If I mean that was the the directive that came through from management , but if we had a a decent case for that we really think it's important to include video and D_V_D_ , I could get back to them and see . 
UNKNOWN It's w it's just whether it's worth arguing about . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Are there any questions for clarification of Maarika before we go on to the next one ? 
UNKNOWN So in the u user interface requirements uh uh uh we we have been able to identify what are the basic buttons that we do want . 
UNKNOWN Um but um so so at this stage , uh how we go about implementing those button we will not identify or I mean in we can completely do away with buttons and uh have some kind of a fancy user interface or something like that . 
UNKNOWN But uh is is there any uh uh any thoughts on that ? 
UNKNOWN Um well , I think the buttons are still mm kind of the most um easy for the user to use , I mean um what other options would you have ? 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN A little screen or something , but this would be really kind of I think a lot of learning for the user and and I mean the user just wants to get um get a result um quickly , not to spend time in like um giving several orders um I dunno . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , and it'll make the costs yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN I think I th I would I would think the put the buttons , but if if you have other mm proposals um . 
UNKNOWN Uh I think the co costs will also play a big role when we come to know about them . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN So well we can probably wait until t we have more knowledge on that . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh i if the if the costs allow , we can have like an L_C_D_ display and uh with um because we do want something fancy and fashionable as well . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So yeah ? 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
CONFIRMATION Cool . 
UNKNOWN Sure , we can discuss that maybe after the next one . 
CONFIRMATION Cool . 
UNKNOWN Do you want to yeah . 
UNKNOWN Do you wanna give me the little cable thing ? 
UNKNOWN Uh am I going in the right direction ? 
NEGATION No . 
CONFUSION Wait .
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay , here it comes . 
UNKNOWN Oh , I'm getting hungry . 
UNKNOWN Okay , here you are . 
CONFIRMATION Cool . 
UNKNOWN Ah , that's why it won't meet . 
CONFIRMATION Okay , cool . 
UNKNOWN You set ? 
UNKNOWN Yep , cool . 
UNKNOWN Okay , functional requirements . 
UNKNOWN Uh we need to do the function key thing so that it comes up on here . 
CONFIRMATION Alright , yeah . 
GREETING Hello . 
UNKNOWN try to press oh , okay , yep . 
UNKNOWN Is it plugged in prop it's working ? 
UNKNOWN It's working . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Excellent . 
CONFIRMATION Cool , okay . 
UNKNOWN So what I have , wh where I've got my information from is a survey where the usability lab um observed remote control use with um a hundred subjects and then they gave them a questionnaire . 
UNKNOWN Um so it was all about , you know , how people feel about the look and feel of the remote control , you know . 
UNKNOWN What's the most annoying things about remote controls and um the possibility of speech recognition and L_C_D_ screens in remote control . 
UNKNOWN Not that they actually gave me any answers on the L_C_D_ screens , so I should have taken that bit out , but anyway . 
UNKNOWN Um okay , so . 
UNKNOWN What they found is that people don't like how current remote controls are , so you know , definitely you should be looking at something quite different . 
UNKNOWN Um seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly . 
UNKNOWN Uh the other twenty five percent have no fashion sense . 
UNKNOWN Uh eighty percent of users would spend more to get um you know , a nice looking remote control . 
UNKNOWN Um current remote controls , they don't match the user behaviour well , as you'll see on the next slide. 
UNKNOWN Um I dunno what zapping is , but Oh , right . 
UNKNOWN It's um switching between channels , sort of randomly going through . 
UNKNOWN But you have that little thing that comes up at the bottom and tells you what's on . 
UNKNOWN Um okay , fifty percent of users say they only use ten percent of the buttons , so that's going back to what , you know , we were saying earlier about , you know , do you need all the buttons on the remote control , they just make it look ugly . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Okay ? 
CONFIRMATION Cool . 
UNKNOWN Um so this is my little graph thing . 
UNKNOWN Ooh , that's a bit difficult to see . 
UNKNOWN Mm k Okay , well , I can send it to all of you . 
UNKNOWN If you explain it to us it'll be fine . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN What it is is um it's cones , 'cause I thought they'd be more exciting . 
UNKNOWN Um but ooh where's it go ? 
UNKNOWN I liked the , I liked the litt ooh come back . 
UNKNOWN Back . 
SURPRISE Oh .
NEGATION No . 
CONFIRMATION Oh yes , cool . 
UNKNOWN Okay , I'm gonna stop playing with the little pointy thing . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um okay , so like what it shows is how much things are used relatively and what you can clearly see from that is the thing that's used most is the channel selection . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN What you can't see is volume selection , it's a little bit higher than all the others . 
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm , that's the next one along , yeah ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , so what the graph shows is that , you know , power , channel selection and volume selection are important , and the rest of them , you know , nobody really uses and so that's the the numbers along the top represent their like um their importance , you know , so on a scale of one to ten , how important is that and , you know , channel selection and volume selection are absolutely essential , and the power , well it's not quite so essential , apparently , although I don't understand how it couldn't be , um and everything else , I think , you know , you can forget about having those buttons on the remote control , 'cause they're just not needed , and they're not used . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN This is the bit that the emailmessed up for me and that's what I was fiddling about with at the beginning of the thing . 
CONFIRMATION Okay , cool . 
UNKNOWN So um okay , so this is what people find annoying about remote controls . 
UNKNOWN Uh that they get lost , that the uh you know , they're not intuitive and that they're bad for repetitive strain injury . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN I think if you're watching enough T_V_ to get repetitive strain injury from um you know , watching T_V_ , then that's the least of your problems , but you know , it's up there . 
UNKNOWN The remote control . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Um that yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so um I mean the the R_S_I_ thing would be that , like when you have the computer keyboards and you keep your wrists up would be something that encourages you want something with an ergonomic t design that encourages good use of the remote control and you know , not straining your wrists watching T_V_ . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
CONFIRMATION Okay , cool . 
UNKNOWN Right , um sorry this is pink because I was copying and pasting the table , and I didn't have time to white it out again . 
UNKNOWN That's alright . 
UNKNOWN Um okay , but that shows how people whether they would pay more for voice recognition software . 
UNKNOWN So you can see from that that , you know , younger people to the age of thirty five are quite likely to pay quite a lot more f well quite are quite likely to pay more for voice recognition software , whereas as people get older , they're a bit more sceptical about it and they're less willing to to try it . 
UNKNOWN Um so clearly voice recognition is something to think about , but um you know I d I do wonder how well that would work given that a T_V_ , you know , tends to be people talking and um , you know , how are you going to stop it from just flipping channels whilst watching T_V_ . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Um okay ? 
CONFIRMATION Cool . 
UNKNOWN Um okay , so these are my personal preferences . 
UNKNOWN So you have sleek , stylish , sophisticated , you know , so something that's , you know , a bit cool . 
UNKNOWN Um you know , functional , so it's useful , but minimalist . 
UNKNOWN Um there's a there's an important thing that , you know , people use when , you know , when you're filling up your home , you know , a lot of people fill up their home with bits of crap , basically , you know , and you've got all this stuff , and you're just like , what the hell is that , who is ever gonna use it ? 
UNKNOWN You know , so things should either be functional or beautiful or preferably both , so I think we need to aim for both . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Um okay , then a long battery life , like you were talking about earlier and um , you know , I was thinking that solar power would be quite cool because , you know , your remote control just sits there , and you could just sit it in the sunshine and save the environment a bit . 
UNKNOWN Um and then like a locator , so you know , kind of like you have for a mobile phone or not a mobile phone Yeah , that's it , you know . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Some kind of a ring , some Right . 
UNKNOWN Keys and things like that , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Whistle and it screams at you , yeah . 
UNKNOWN I know , it's weird . 
UNKNOWN My flatmate and I were talking about this on the way into uni this morning and I was like I need to get one for everything . 
UNKNOWN So yeah , so maybe something where you clap and then it beeps , something a kind of sound that you don't often hear on the T_V_ , you know , 'cause you don't want your remote control beeping every five minutes , 'cause you you'd then deliberately lose it by throwing it out the window or something . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So okay ? 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Cool . 
UNKNOWN That's me . 
UNKNOWN That's you , excellent . 
UNKNOWN Okay , that's great , thanks . 
UNKNOWN Um that's very good , very interesting . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN I'm just gonna tick yes . 
UNKNOWN So , we've got about ten , fifteen minutes to discuss Mm-hmm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN I think one of the very interesting things that came up in um uh Ka Kate Cat Cat's uh presentationwas um uh this this issue of uh uh like voice recognition being more popular with uh younger people . 
UNKNOWN Cat's . 
UNKNOWN Ca . 
UNKNOWN So if we need to have a target group um then uh I think as far as the m motto of our company is concerned , if we want to have something sleek and uh you know , good looking uh we are better off targeting a younger audience then um you know , people who are comparatively elderly . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I mean that's the thing is that it didn't say in the survey , you know , whether , you know , these are the people that will pay more for a more stylish remote control , but I'm assuming , you know , yes . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Bu but but the survey did say that f things like voice recognition are more popular with them , so if you want to put in something stylish , then uh th it'll certainly be more popular with this i ye with the younger people as compared to older people , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Then again I guess the th where it was most popular was the fifteen to twenty five bracket and the I don't know how often they're buying televisions . 
UNKNOWN Right , and Right . 
UNKNOWN Well , that's when you go to uni , isn't it ? 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN So , you know Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but you don't have much money , generally . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , you share a television or something that yeah . 
UNKNOWN I would've thought it's it's more that twenty five to thirty five , when people are really moving out and they've got their first job and they want their nice toys and O oh it's on sorry , we unplugged it . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN But uh still , if if you can go back to that slideand uh , how popular was it ? 
UNKNOWN Oh , I've unplugged it . 
UNKNOWN Do you want me to Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Oh , oh , okay . 
UNKNOWN Here , let me Yeah . 
UNKNOWN That's alright , if you can just look it up on your computer , wh uh um people between twenty five to thirty five , uh how popular was so it was sti still still quite popular amongst them . 
UNKNOWN Seventy six point three percent . 
UNKNOWN It was seventy something , yeah , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So even they are seventy six percent , is that high amount ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I kn I mean I know what you're saying about the fifteen to twenty five year olds , but I mean it has been proven that that people of that age group have a higher disposable income because they don't have like I mean , you know , if you're at university , you're paying your rent , but you don't have a mortgage , you don't have a life insurance policy , you don't normally have a car , yeah , so . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , they've got no commitments and usually not a car and all of those things . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
UNKNOWN Kids . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN You're still learning to drive actually , so that just costs more than a car , but yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So you're more likely to b Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um so I mean like it is an age group to target , really , I think . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , and if we're if we're talking twenty five Euros as a price , that's not unaffordable , even for young people . 
UNKNOWN No , I mean that's what , that's like fifteen Pounds ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN You know , I think Yeah , I d I don't know many people without a T_V_ . 
UNKNOWN Yeah this this is not unaffordable , but the problem is whether people need it , whether they do have a T_V_ to use its full Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But do they But the T_V_s are often kind of someone's old T_V_ that's blah blah and be a bit strange to have a fancy rome remote . 
UNKNOWN We didn't have a T_V_ last year , and everyone thought we were off our heads , you know . 
UNKNOWN Common , the students yeah , yeah . 
UNKNOWN The s the stu yeah , and the remote control might not yeah , it might not even function with the old T_V_ . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I d well we've we've got quite a d decent T_V_ . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Bu but even even in the case of twenty five to thirty five it's quite popular , right ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , we're still yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So mm uh are are are Mm . 
UNKNOWN Or w maybe we can just kind of uh uh Yeah , but at the same time I think maybe we can we can just decide to to have both of these groups as our target , because actually I mean they're all still re young people . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think I think the fact that , you know , ninety one point two percent of fifteen to twenty five year olds are saying yes , I would pay more for a voice recognition remote control , does say quite a lot really . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN You know , so I mean that and the disposable income and I don't think it's something to ignore , you know . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Is not a massive difference , you know . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , if we ta if we take fifteen to thirty five , but that then does imply that we should try and incorporate voice recognition . 
UNKNOWN No , do totally . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Is that gonna have a an implication for the technical specs ? 
UNKNOWN Um I was having a a general outlook on um m most like sophisticated features , but voice recognition itself I'm not very sure about , because one of the p uh things that Cat pointed out was uh uh how do we go about implementing it ? 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Uh and uh Yeah . 
UNKNOWN You do have it in your mobile phone though , don't you ? 
UNKNOWN Because you have like I mean every mobile phone now has like call this person and it calls them . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But how frequently do we use it anyway and um uh h ho how good is it , you know uh voice recognition softwares are still quite uh Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I don't know . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN With um but with a T_V_ remote it's gonna be quite limited if we're t saying the main things people want to do is on off channel five , louder , tha that should be relatively simple . 
CONFIRMATION An Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN S so y you'd maybe need a code word . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN O Right . 
UNKNOWN Do you know what I mean ? 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN So like when you say change , except that's being said quite a lot on T_V_ , so maybe like , you know , remote . 
UNKNOWN I mean how often do people say remote on T_V_ ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Although I only watch Charmed , so really I wouldn't know but like so you'd just say remote five , you know , remote ten , remote one two nine . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so it seems like a feasible thing to implement uh for for a limited yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but maybe if you wanna look into that just to just to check . 
UNKNOWN Um , so if we go for the the fifteen to thirty five age group and then of course we're going to get th anyone who's older than thirty five who wants to look young and hip and trendy and has the money , then they'll they'll still go for the same advertising . 
UNKNOWN Yeah but uh um Yeah , yeah sure , yeah , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I don't think there's a lot of uh voice recognition remote controls . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , w well now the v the voice recognition if if it works wonderfully w we could possibly do away with all buttons , but I think this is not really the right moment yet , because people are just so used to buttons and um , yeah it's it's kind of safer , so we we need both , so the voice recognition would be just an extra , it wouldn't really reduce the size of the remote . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I think we need both . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN W What uh Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN What wh uh what I was thinking is that there is this uh separation between what the channels are on T_V_ and how they are numbered on the remote control . 
UNKNOWN If we can do with away with that , our product can be really popular uh in the sense that uh a person can say , I want to watch uh I_T_V_ one instead of saying that I want to go onto channel number forty five . 
UNKNOWN Uh-huh . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that would be another way to do it . 
UNKNOWN Uh-huh . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , so if uh if something like that can be incorporated , some kind of Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So that if that was in the the voice recognition , that would be great . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but then the code word would be even more important , because I mean Sky advertise on every channel , don't they , you know , so then it would be you'd be watching Charmed , and then the Sky advert would come on and it would change to Sky . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Watch Sky and yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah , and that would be really annoying . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's Right . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN But that's definitely a possibility . 
UNKNOWN Yeah but m but on the other hand , remote control isn't as close to you you probably might just just uh speak into it and and the T_V_ would be already further away , so it might not pick up the other things coming from there . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Do you not think that defeats the object of having voice recognition on a remote control though ? 
UNKNOWN So that you can yell at it , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , you know , so you have to have the remote control . 
UNKNOWN It's more like if you lost it and it's down the sofa sometime , you can yell at it and it'll just change it , you can look for it later , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but then the remote control I think I mean um the idea is kind of it's it's not that it's sitting there on on top of the television , because then you could already yell at the television and you wouldn't you you wouldn't need the remote control , so the remote control is still something you keep n near yourself . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah , I suppose nearer to you but a b like if you have surround sound then Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Mm yeah and it might become very difficult from a distance for the television to understand what you're saying because of the noise factor for the remote control being cl I mean it'll it'll mm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN No , but I I I was just defending the the fact why why we want to keep the remote control close to us , a and uh not to yell at it from the distance . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So uh wh another thing uh that can be used is that uh there can be a beeper button on the T_V_ , so you can go and press that button and um and the remote control , wherever it is , it'll beep , so we we can probably come to know where it is . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN That's but then if you're buying the remote separately , but y you could have something , but i if it was something that you could like stick onto the T_V_ or something , some like a two p if you bought it in a two part pack , so one part attaches to the T_V_ . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Oh yeah , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Right , yeah , yeah , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay , yeah , mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , 'cause it's it's quite important that you don't lose the the bit to locate the remote control . 
UNKNOWN The l Well that's right , but it solves the problem of having different noises . 
CONFIRMATION Alright , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , definitely , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay , I think we're gonna have to wrap this up um . 
UNKNOWN But if we go away with that that kind of general um specification in mind that we're looking at fifteen to thirty five year olds , we want it to look simple , but still have the buttons so it's easy to use , but only those key buttons , the major buttons and then one sort of menu one , and then voice recognition included as an option um but that obviously needs a little bit more working out as to whether it's really feasible and some of those problems we were mentioning um . 
UNKNOWN The major ones , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN What we have to do now is to go back to our little places , complete our questionnaire and some sort of summarisation , which y you'll get immediately by email. 
UNKNOWN Send me your presentationsso that I can use them to make the minutes, and then we've got a lunch break and after lunch we go back to our own little stations and have thirty minutes more work . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um I'll put the minutesin that project documentsfolder , but I'll send you an emailwhen I do it , so that you know . 
UNKNOWN So where exactly is this i Ah , okay . 
UNKNOWN It should be on your desktop , so on the yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So I'll put it I'll put them there as soon as I've written them . 
UNKNOWN Did you find it ? 
UNKNOWN It's just yeah , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah in that one , right yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , and emailthem round . 
UNKNOWN Oh , so y you want our um PowerPointpresentationsin there , hey ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that would be great . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Oh so so we'll just put them i there , we we yeah , w we won't even okay . 
UNKNOWN Oh yeah , put them in there . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , then you don't have to emailthem . 
UNKNOWN There you go . 
UNKNOWN But is everyone's called functional requirements ? 
UNKNOWN No , they're all called something slightly different . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN Technical requirements and something something , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so that's good . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN That's me done . 
UNKNOWN So , if you put them in there , we'll all be able to see them and refer to them if we need to . 
CONFIRMATION Okay , cool . 
UNKNOWN Um as to where we're going from here , you're going to look at the components concept . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Yeah ? 
UNKNOWN Whatever that means . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I guess I'll find out . 
UNKNOWN You'll be looking you'll be looking at the user interface concept , on something conceptual and you're watching trends to see how we go and surely voice recognition'll fall off the mapor something that um we'll keep keep our options op hmm ? 
UNKNOWN Uh something conceptual , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Wha what was it again that I was supposed to look into ? 
UNKNOWN Con components , oh . 
UNKNOWN Components , yeah . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Sorry , but um the next meeting um are we going to have it um right after lunch or shall we prepare our To prepare , okay , yeah , that's good . 
UNKNOWN No , we have we have after lunch we have thirty minutes to ourselves to prepare , so that's fine , w before lunch we just have to complete the questionnaire and some sort of summary . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Okay ? 
UNKNOWN Right on time . 
CONFIRMATION Cool . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so you can I guess we'll see you for lunch in a sec ? 
UNKNOWN Okay , see you . 
CONFIRMATION Excellent . 
UNKNOWN So um I sent you the agenda, it was on the in the project documents. 
UNKNOWN I don't know if you got a chance to just have a look at it . 
UNKNOWN Anyway , it's the meeting's gonna follow more or less the same structure as last time , so we'll go round each of you in turn and you can give your presentationson what you've been up to . 
UNKNOWN Um and at the end of that we need to discuss what you've come up with , so that we can make a decision on the key remote control concepts , so that's we need to know about the components' properties , materials , the user interface and any trends that the Marketing Expert has been watching . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um , do you wanna start again ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Let me we've got forty minutes . 
UNKNOWN Right s so I haven't made a PowerPointpresentation, yeah , I I thought I'll use the whiteboard instead . 
UNKNOWN You haven't made a PowerPoint, okay . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um mm , okay , so basically I'll start off by uh I thought I'll use the whiteboard because we have so many different options and what we can do is that we can start um uh rubbing off the options that we do not require and putting in the options that uh are m or highlighting or underlining them or something like that . 
UNKNOWN Let's hope the pen holds out . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so uh I'll start again with a brief introduction to connect that anyway brief introduction to the insides of a remote control and uh then we can probably uh discuss the various components . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so w what you see here is so this is the outside of the remote , right ? 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN If you open it , you have a circuit board here , right , and this is the chip that I was talking about last time . 
UNKNOWN This basically sends information to a tr uh transistor here , which then uh sends the information to an L_E_D_ device here . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN If you flip the printed circuit board , and this is th the most important point here , uh everything else is kind of Okay , so if you flip the circuit board , this is what it looks like . 
UNKNOWN So you see for example a particular button attaches to a particular place on the P_C_B_ and uh on pressing this button I a circuit completes , the information goes to the chip , which is somewhere here and the chip that tra then translates the code into an infra infrared radiation , which goes goes out through there . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So uh the important point that I read over the website was uh that the configurations of these printed circuit circuit boards uh are quite cheap to make , you can ge get them printed as you want to , so w we can have a configuration um irrespective of the cost , the way we want to have . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Right ? 
UNKNOWN So that's the important point here , so these are the different options that we have . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So the batteries , I'll start with the battery , right ? 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So they can be simple which is like uh the normal batteries in uh our uh the cells , yeah ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh thes these are the kind different kind of batteries that the company makes , right ? 
UNKNOWN So . 
UNKNOWN And dynamos . 
UNKNOWN Um yeah , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Does that mean like a wind-up one ? 
UNKNOWN So uh I don't know if even if you want to consider this , but these are the different things that the company makes , so th they'll they'll since uh they'll come internally from the company , they'll be eas uh cheaper , uh all these options . 
UNKNOWN A wind-up remote . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So the third one is uh the kinetic energy ones . 
UNKNOWN You could make the hand dynamo into an exercise bike , and then people could exercise whilst watching T_V_ . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And charging their remote , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , and stop worrying about the whole R_S_I_ from the remote thing , 'cause that's just Yay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , it's a good option . 
UNKNOWN The the kinetic energy one is uh that e uh uh they are usually modern watches , since our hand keeps moving , it keeps the watch ticking . 
UNKNOWN Uh yeah . 
UNKNOWN But I dunno i if it is a good idea for a remote control , because it'll just lie there for a long while sometimes . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN For a remote , 'cause you Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But as soon as you pick it up it moves and then again it uh re recharges or something . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And the fourth option is the solar cells , which are also made by the company . 
UNKNOWN Environment friendly . 
UNKNOWN Okay um so I'll list things and then we can come back and discuss what what we think from uh everybody's perspective . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN There are different cases that can be provided . 
UNKNOWN They can be basically the shape of the cases , they can be flat , they can be curved with uh one-sided curved and one side flat , and they can be curved with on both the sides . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN These are the three options , right ? 
UNKNOWN Um Yeah , would it be flat on both the sides , would be curved from one side , or whatever uh there were different kind of supplements available , um like it can be in plastic , rubber , wood , or titanium , right ? 
UNKNOWN Um you mean this would be like the the overall shape of the remote control , yeah , mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , mm-hmm , mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Did you say wool ? 
UNKNOWN Wo wo wood . 
UNKNOWN Wood , wood . 
UNKNOWN Wood . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Oh right . 
UNKNOWN A fluffy remote . 
UNKNOWN Not wool . 
UNKNOWN . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , you'll understand why when we get to my presenta . 
UNKNOWN Oh really ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Huh . 
UNKNOWN Um the so uh we can use even um a certain titanium is also used uh in the company to make uh uh some space design equipment , so it's kind of um uh it'll be probably nicer to use , because it relates to the overall image of the company , but uh it cannot be used on a double curved surface . 
UNKNOWN If we choose this , we cannot use titanium . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN For for these two we can use titanium , wood , rubber , or plastic . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah ? 
UNKNOWN Uh okay , the interface options now . 
UNKNOWN So we can have push-buttons , like most remotes do and our company is an expert in making push-buttons . 
UNKNOWN Ooh . 
UNKNOWN Uh we can have scroll wheels like the ones on um uh mouse pointers uh uh Yeah , yeah , something like that . 
UNKNOWN Sony . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Sony Ericsson mobile phones has it . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN So , and they have they can even have an an integrated uh push-button inside the scrolling thing . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN The scroll plus push . 
UNKNOWN So this is something that has been recently developed by the company , um in the last decade , so not too recent . 
UNKNOWN And L_C_D_s , we can have L_C_D_s . 
UNKNOWN So these two are recent and and this is q quite old . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN The various electronic options are um uh so th this concerns firs first of all the the chips I I showed you at uh so there's there's a chip behind this one , right ? 
UNKNOWN The P_C_B_ is uh inexpensive , so we can put put in uh whatever we want , but the various integrated circuit options are , we have either a simple one or a regular or advanced . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN And uh the price goes up as we go down , obviously . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um okay , so the good thing about uh wh wh why why we would want to use advanced u why we might want to use advanced is that L_C_D_s can only come with the advanced chip . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um the we need regular or advanced for uh scroll wheels . 
UNKNOWN Right ? 
UNKNOWN Um and the chip basically includes the infra infrared sender . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh besides this in electr under electronics uh also the company has started making a sample sender , which is did not explained what i what it was , but I'm guessing that uh so they have a sample sender and a sample speaker . 
UNKNOWN So I'm guessing that uh the sample speaker is probably something like um uh you know , as soon as you press a button , it it mm uh give gives you feedback , one five or whatever . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , on . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um and uh I dunno whether sample sender sender has to do something with voice recognition or not , but anyway . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So , these are the different options that we have . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so th that's that's basically now now uh I think that uh we can integrate um uh you know , uh the user interface uh and uh the marketing things in that , keep uh taking out things from this and uh underlining things that are important , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Excellent . 
UNKNOWN Do you wanna stay somewhere near the board , so that if we need to you can sit down , but just we might need you to leap up . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah , sure . 
CONFIRMATION Sure . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN What are you , PowerPoint, or Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um I have some PowerPoint, yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN Do you think these pens can give you cancer of the hand ? 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN Some sort of radiation ? 
UNKNOWN No it's got its little camera in there , plug it in . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN 'S a Ugly . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , it should should do it . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Right , interface concept . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um to be honest actually , I mentioned some some of the things which which could fit on the on the this talk um this time , I m I mentioned them already in the previous talk . 
CONFIRMATION That's fine . 
UNKNOWN So um yeah , this time um I might not have them on the slidesbut I I can just mention them aw again . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So um I thought um I would also include the definition of user interface um so it's the aspects of a of of a computer system or programme which can be seen uh by the user um and and which uh the mechanisms that the user uses to control its operation and input data . 
UNKNOWN So this would p includes things like shape and size and buttons and um voice recognition as well , and colour , and so on . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um um the method I employed this time was a again having a look to related products and mainly on the internet and then um analyse them uh from the point of view of user fen friendliness and also um whether their appearance was was pleasant . 
UNKNOWN Um and then um this uh this um this can help us to decide which features we want to incorporate in our product . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So some findings um um . 
UNKNOWN So in in the case of many user interfaces , they're just so full of buttons that it's actually uh hard to find the ones you you really um want to use and um and it's just confusing , it takes y know time to learn . 
UNKNOWN Um okay , and I thought I would just quickly show some of them that I found . 
UNKNOWN Okay , some of them are here . 
UNKNOWN Um well the picture is not very clear , but as you can see , there are actu oi , oh oh oh , sorry for that . 
UNKNOWN 'S go back . 
UNKNOWN That's nice one . 
UNKNOWN Ah , no , please . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so yeah , they're quite big and have many many buttons . 
UNKNOWN Actually of the of all these I personally p prefer this one , because it's it's the smallest and and with with least uh with the smallest number of buttons as well . 
UNKNOWN And I would say even the appearance of some of them is kind of not so nice . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Um okay . 
UNKNOWN So let's carry on with this . 
UNKNOWN Um So uh um o other findings um some new things um used , uh some of them were mentioned already by our Technical um Designer uh . 
UNKNOWN Our own company has developed a new in user interface uh wait , no this is not the one . 
UNKNOWN Okay , there is a we can uh include voice recognition and um it allows i it's possible to record eighty different voice samples on it . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Uh so uh this uh this one was already mentioned uh the L_C_ display . 
UNKNOWN It's yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um s another new development is a scroll button , which was also th also already mentioned . 
UNKNOWN And uh our own manufacturing division ha has uh designed a new um uh programmable speech uh mm sorry uh speaker unit I guess it's it should be . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um and this means that um once uh uh it it it comes together with a voice recognition , but it's once once the mm um gadget uh recognises uh the voice of the speaker , there can be a um pre-programmed answer , for example , you can pick up the remote control and say something to it like hello and it says some hello and your name or whatever . 
UNKNOWN Uh-huh , hi yeah . 
UNKNOWN So I mean this is also one of the n dev new developments which we might consider if we wanted to include . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Uh sorry , uh can you go back for a second ? 
UNKNOWN Um uh are you sure wha what this means , a spinning wheel with the L_C_ display ? 
UNKNOWN Uh oh yeah are th Oh okay , the iPod thing , yeah . 
UNKNOWN It's like the like you said , no ? 
UNKNOWN The scroll scroll wheel . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , you can't Oh , it's like the iPod . 
UNKNOWN No no , the scroll button is a different thing . 
UNKNOWN I I have a picture if you just a moment , I'll I'll show you . 
UNKNOWN I wasn't completely sure myself , but I think it's just like um it's it's a wheel , it's like not separate buttons . 
UNKNOWN Look , this one here . 
UNKNOWN But I'm I'm not really sure whether whether you can really turn it round , it's like you press this or this or Uh-huh . 
UNKNOWN G yeah , no , you can . 
UNKNOWN Uh it's the iPod uh kind of uh Alright , right . 
UNKNOWN It's like it's like where you you know how you have your your mouse , and y you go round and i it's kind of like that and you spin round and it yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh-huh . 
UNKNOWN Okay , okay . 
UNKNOWN So instead of going down you just spin yeah , yeah . 
UNKNOWN It is You just go round and it is a bit weird at first , but it's actually very like fast . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Uh-huh . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN I like the the wheels that click on the side you you get 'em much slower , so it's quite good if you like searching quite a lot of stuff . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Do you know , if you're lookin if you're th scrolling through the A_ to Z_ of your music and you're looking for something at T_ , then it's a lot faster than the wheel , but you've got a lot less control over it . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN So maybe I should include that here as well , L_C_D_s um plus spinning . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh Okay , and the personal preferences are pretty much the same as as as last time . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN It it has to be small , simple . 
UNKNOWN Okay , we decided to include voice recognition , so to have the standard uh major buttons like on , off , um ch the channels and and then um volume and then the rest would be a menu on the screen . 
UNKNOWN Um and I I also thought uh if we want to keep it small and nice um and actually I I quite like the idea of a scroll a scrolling button , I thought it could be for for voice like , I dunno , it mm like on a um i like it used to be on Walkmans or something . 
UNKNOWN There is uh I think there is no reason why we couldn't use something like this for for the remote control . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So yeah , that's uh that's it . 
CONFIRMATION Excellent . 
UNKNOWN Okay , straight to trends , and then we can discuss it all at once . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Okay , I've put the copyof the presentationin um the yeah . 
UNKNOWN The project documents. 
CONFIRMATION Excellent . 
UNKNOWN If you two could both do that as well , in case we need to refer to it . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Cool . 
UNKNOWN Here it comes . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Fabulous . 
CONFIRMATION Okay , cool . 
UNKNOWN Um so what I did was to search the internet to come up with market trends and you know what users are gonna be wanting in the the near future . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Now , the first aspect is apparently twice as important as the second aspect , which is twice as important as the third a aspect . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So , I mean the the easy to use thing is fairly low down on the which I think given the target group is what you would expect , really . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um , you know , people want something new , something technologically innovative and different , so the whole idea with the L_C_D_s and the spinning and the colours and the voice recognition is quite like , quite the thing to go for . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN And um , yeah it wants to look fancy , fancy look and feel . 
UNKNOWN So um uh maybe uh as you're discussing things , is it okay if we just uh keep highlighting things here ? 
UNKNOWN So Yeah , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah , sure . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN So mm uh so it yeah , so probably voice recognition is is kind of important , right ? 
UNKNOWN That's over on the interface , if if you could put Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um and an yeah . 
UNKNOWN And maybe the L_C_D_ and spinning so that means we need an advanced thing . 
UNKNOWN Okay , I I have a point about L_C_D_ , I dunno if it is the right point to take it up . 
UNKNOWN W uh L_C_D_s are basically for feedback , right , to the user who's pressing buttons , and the feedback can come through television itself , so do we need an L_C_D_ on the remote ? 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Depends how fast your television runs , really , don't don't you think ? 
UNKNOWN I mean we've got one of those um Telewest boxes and you put the number in the remote and then you wait and then it goes to the T_V_ and then you wait , and then it comes , so i it actually takes quite a long time . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN And if you get the number in wrong , then it's a bit of a pain , so I think , you know , a screen on the remote would probably cut down your time on that . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN But like remotes do tend to get f thrown about a bit . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN It it is also quite nice though to to have something here so you don't interrupt the picture on the screen , so if you're watching something Yeah . 
UNKNOWN You know ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN That's true , yeah , that's also Right . 
UNKNOWN And i it would be like I mean if you could make it integrate with the T_V_ then it could come up with new information about what's on , and you could just see that on the remote rather than Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Rather than having to interrupt your viewing pleasure . 
UNKNOWN But um I think maybe a way to do it would be a similar way to how you have your mobile phone , you know , like you have the slidey ones and you have the flippy ones and then the screen's protected so it doesn't actually get scratched . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So you can have like what looks like a normal remote control , you know or like a minimalist remote control . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So you got your buttons one to nine , your on and off and your volume on that and then if you want to mess about with it , you flip it open and , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Mm right . 
UNKNOWN And then you can flip it open . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So now we seem to have a consensus that L_C_D_s are definitely the way to go because of style and Right . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , I think so . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , so that kind of decides your whole chip thing . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN You you agree ? 
UNKNOWN Maarika , yeah ? 
UNKNOWN Yep , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN So L_C_D_s , yeah , definitely . 
UNKNOWN Okay ? 
UNKNOWN Go on . 
CONFIRMATION Cool . 
UNKNOWN Okay , apparently , fruit and vegetables will be providing inspiration . 
UNKNOWN Sorry , I discovered clip art . 
UNKNOWN Um so these will be an important feature for clothes , shoes and furniture . 
UNKNOWN So I mean , I'm taking this to mean , you know , curviness . 
UNKNOWN Do you know ? 
UNKNOWN 'Cause you don't tend to get flat vegetables . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , and possibly even uneven , like not not symmet yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN You know ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , bit of asymmetry and stuff . 
UNKNOWN But that would be a good way to to get in the whole um R_S_I_ issue in there , because I mean if you think most people use the remote control with their right hand ha right hands so you wanna you curve it so that it's suitable for use with the right hand . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um yeah , I'm not quite sure about the relevance of material will be spongy . 
UNKNOWN Um Yeah , but I mean y you have to Well I suppose you wouldn't get a remote uh an electric shock off your remote control if it was made of rubber . 
UNKNOWN Something a bit squishy and Yeah , and it'd help if you drop it , it protects it as well . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , we we have we have rubber , but there is a problem that I forgot to discuss with the um with using So if if we use uh latex cases , they won't allow us to use solar cells , as an energy source that is the constraint , so um we could use titanium , wood or plastic uh or uh Yeah , w energy source . 
UNKNOWN So it could be like a rubbery yeah , uh-huh . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah . 
UNKNOWN To some degree . 
UNKNOWN Uh-huh . 
UNKNOWN Or if we want to use the the latex , then we have to go with one of the other um power things . 
UNKNOWN If it's made of rubber you could get the kinetic energy fairly easily there , you could just bounce it up and down . 
UNKNOWN From from bouncing it . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , tap it on the desk , yeah . 
UNKNOWN You can have it as like a little ball to bounce , that flips open . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um so yeah , um okay . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN So probably double curved surface is the way to go , yeah , . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Mm yeah . 
UNKNOWN Or or curved at one end and flat on the top , because I I'm not sure if it is flat on both both the sides , then ho how much easy would it be to reach for buttons , etcetera . 
UNKNOWN Um Yeah . 
UNKNOWN You have to have a certain element of flatness , I think . 
UNKNOWN It it depends on the whole ergonomics of it , you know , it's like how you put your hands so y it's the least movement basically . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , singe single side curved or double side curved does not say too much , does it ? 
UNKNOWN Uh-huh . 
UNKNOWN It uh Mm . 
UNKNOWN No , I d I don't think it makes a lot of difference . 
UNKNOWN I I have one of those s slidey phones and I mean the back is essentially straight , but it's curvy , so . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Besides , you have four sides to a thing , so I mean does curved one side mean one side is straight and , you know curved two sides means the whole thing is just a big curvy p thing ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , 'cause the Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh I think uh Right . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
CONFUSION Dunno . 
UNKNOWN Di now did it say anywhere in your research material about this sliding stuff uh because um according to the information that I have , I think uh the onl only options that we have with the case is are these three . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh eith either we have uh a flat surfaced uh case or a curved surfaced case . 
UNKNOWN It does not say anything about uh whether technically , you know , this this stuff is available at all . 
UNKNOWN Nothing to open them . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh it's it's more about the protecting the L_C_D_ , which I think is where it came from . 
UNKNOWN Right , yeah , yeah . 
UNKNOWN But no , my research didn't tell me anything , which is why we have all the pictures , 'cause I had nothing better to do with my time . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay , cool . 
UNKNOWN Anything else ? 
UNKNOWN What've we got ? 
UNKNOWN Uh combine style with a level of functionality , um beauty and practicality and a thing of beauty and p function . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so . 
UNKNOWN Cool , thanks . 
UNKNOWN Okay ? 
UNKNOWN Thanks Yeah uh-hum yeah . 
UNKNOWN Looking at what we've got , we we want an L_C_D_ display with a spinning wheel . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Let's let's try to r rub off things and yeah , so um hand dynamos are definitely out , right ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , rub off some of those . 
UNKNOWN You you got a wind dynamo , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , it's not that's not streamlined and sexy , having a having a wind up . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um kinetic energy does seem to have some kind of uh uh appeal , but uh it's Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think tha Depends how much how much movement it really needs . 
UNKNOWN It's about the practicality of it really , isn't it ? 
UNKNOWN You know ? 
UNKNOWN As against a watch , which constantly keeps moving , this this thing will have to be tapped every time , which which might be very frustrating for the user . 
UNKNOWN I mean if I can't imagine a m wooden remote control . 
UNKNOWN Kinetic energy it needs I don't have too much technical information on that , yeah , right . 
UNKNOWN Pr presumably if they're suggesting it , then we could use it . 
UNKNOWN Okay , let's keep it option uh keep an option , yeah . 
UNKNOWN I'd I'd keep it on . 
UNKNOWN Um the flat co completely flat case is definitely out , right ? 
UNKNOWN We don't want that it's no it's not not vegetable . 
UNKNOWN It has to be at least curved from one side , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah it's yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um okay , we still have all all the options . 
UNKNOWN Wood , do you think wood will be a good idea ? 
UNKNOWN N wood is I can't n how do you uh I mean you can't keep it really small uh you can't make it like thin and The wood thing . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Because you need to you n you need to put all the technology in , so I mean if the case you add the case and it it becomes a bit bulky wi mm-mm yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah if if it is really thin if it is really thin it it's likely to break , it's it's much more uh Right . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , and given that we're we're looking at more spongy material preferences , I ha would think maybe rubber or plastic is more Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN U yeah wood is not really yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well it's not very cleanable either , do you know . 
UNKNOWN That's true . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It's it's not a practical I mean it's it's alright for a table , but for a remote control , you know . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And splinters and stuff and It just m doesn't make any sense , I think is the thing with wood . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , okay wood is out . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah , in the case of remote control not really . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay , now for the really interesting stuff , the interface . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Right , so uh the the push-buttons is is our expertise uh in the industry , but uh it seems to be out of trend , you know , nobody seems to be Mm right . 
UNKNOWN You have to have some push-buttons , don't you ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but you um I think for for the channel numb uh channel numbers you still need them , wouldn't you ? 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN G yeah , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , so for channel numbers but But I th yeah but I think the L_C_D_ display is kind of yeah , it's faster with a m yeah and w if we dis and when we s um discussed that we might like this flipping open thing , then I mean y you can use it as a normal remote control , but if you do want to use L_C_D_ , then you flip it open , but it's it it's more time-consuming . 
UNKNOWN Oh , if if we have L_C_D_ displays , that opens up a whole world , you know , if you have an L_C_D_ display , then mm you can select almost everything on the L_C_D_ display . 
UNKNOWN Just for fast Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think this is going back to the the graph at the beginning that I made , where , you know , the buttons that people use all the time , you want buttons for them and everything else menu-driven . 
UNKNOWN Mm right . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And it yeah L_ L_C_D_ . 
UNKNOWN So uh in in the buttons we have for the channels also we have options . 
UNKNOWN Do you do we enumerate everything from zero to nine ? 
UNKNOWN Or do we have just uh channel plus , channel minus , just to just to scroll ? 
UNKNOWN No , no , I mean mm we we definitely need the the numbers , because it's uh otherwise people don't want to flip through all the channels . 
UNKNOWN The numbers . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Do we need them on as buttons or do we need them as L_C_D_ ? 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Um Yeah , I would say buttons , because it's yeah . 
UNKNOWN Or on the L_C_D_ we can , you know Okay . 
UNKNOWN G yeah , I would think buttons , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Buttons . 
UNKNOWN It's it's the I think the thing is , so if someone just wants to turn on their T_V_ and put on a channel , then it should be easier to use than any other remote , and then if someone wants to , you know , change the contrast on their T_V_ and they should be able to do that and it should be accessible , but , you know , I mean most of the time I mean there's a limit to how much the biggest techno geek can spend fiddling with the T_V_ , I think is the the the issue there . 
UNKNOWN I Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So mm Alright . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Okay , so buttons definitely in but oh shall we uh try to drawa prec um Uh okay . 
UNKNOWN I think that's what you guys are gonna do next , so if we put down the key um things that we want . 
UNKNOWN Okay , okay , so the components . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Right , so uh what about the the scrolling uh ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah but n I I'm not completely um completely clear uh I yeah , about the spinning wheel . 
UNKNOWN So I think it it doesn't make sense to have both like a scrolling and spinning thing , it's uh you can al include everything in the spinning if you yeah , yeah , in that case . 
UNKNOWN E either or G yeah . 
UNKNOWN Just spinning and not scrolling , I would say . 
UNKNOWN I would say the s the s the spinning goes at a high speed to th to the scrolling wheel , so you have to decide whether you you know , you want to be going so fast or not . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But I mean the the thing with this whole if y you're planning on making it out of rubber , on the basis that it's spongy , then I'm not sure how well a scrolling wheel would work . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Mm um I'm not sure it'll be a good idea to construct the whole thing out of rubber . 
UNKNOWN But if you've got a if if you've got a flipped thing , effectively it's something that's curved on one side and flat on the other side , but you folded it in half . 
UNKNOWN Ah , but I mean you can Yeah , I um I think so too , I mean the case would be yeah the case would be rubber and the the buttons , rubber buttons , but then Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but y your spinning wheel tends to go to one side . 
UNKNOWN Th that would be on one side , uh-huh . 
UNKNOWN Uh i it Or or at the corners , edges , just the edges covered by rubber or something like that . 
UNKNOWN No , I think it's just the casing rubber on the outside . 
UNKNOWN You want an outside of rubber and then open it up and Or maybe like interchangeable cases . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Everything else in plastic or even titanium if we want to use it . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause I know like we're going back to iPods again n the whole spinning wheel , but I have like a you know , obviously my iPod's not made of rubber , but then I have a little rubber case that goes over the top of it and I can change the colour , theoretically , to match my outfit . 
UNKNOWN Right , right . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Right , okay , so so that gives us a more trendy look as well . 
UNKNOWN Um Right . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I think the spinning wheel is definitely very now . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , and uh we're going more for the trends than for the usability anyway , right ? 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN That's right , that's what they're after . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So I'll rub that out . 
UNKNOWN And uh colours can be provided with the case rather than Um but we still need to te think about the colour of our remote as such , you know , just keep it black , or Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah I think we um it was a a requirement that we use our um th the colours of our company , so would it be like yellow , grey and black or something , or Yeah , does Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I guess . 
UNKNOWN That doesn't fit in with the whole vegetable theme though . 
UNKNOWN Bananas . 
UNKNOWN Banana's yellow , yeah , definitely . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but I mean do you think we could incorporate the colours of the company into the buttons and then make the colour of the main remote the colour like vegetable colours , do you know ? 
UNKNOWN So you could have like I mean I suppose vegetable colours would be orange and green and some reds and um maybe purple and that and then you'd pick the buttons in company colours to to match with it . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Green . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um okay , if you g go over to uh the integrated circuits . 
UNKNOWN Uh since we're having L_C_D_s there there's no way that we're will be able to um what we do need to consider , however , is that the price is going up for the ever every such thing that we are considering , but since L_C_D_s seems to be uh a definite yes , so it seems to be one area where we would want to spend . 
UNKNOWN We need the advanced yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So I'll rub off the other two . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So are we discounting solar energy because rubber's gonna be used in there somewhere or If solar panels with the rubber . 
UNKNOWN That was the We can't have solar panels with rubber , so . 
UNKNOWN Oh is oh the constraint was uh yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So I think uh we'll have uh uh using the simple battery will be a safer option as compared to the kinetic energy one , I mean , a although it does seem uh interesting . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , okay , so we lose that I think . 
UNKNOWN Shall we go for if we're going for rubber , we think uh on as our case , and then Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN And the buttons as well , I think . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN We've got five more minutes. 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But it does not hold any advantages as such for a yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN It's just a gimmick . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Uh okay , so r we understand this better now that uh the the speaker is for the feedback , right ? 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN It it says uh the things that you type in or something like that , so Ye yeah , we we don't have too much information about it , um Yeah , okay , so so th this is in as well then , the sample speaker . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think if we can if we can include them at not too much extra cost , then I'd put them in , but if it's Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but it it I think it should be quite cheap because it's from our own company , yeah . 
UNKNOWN It's from the company , so Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN And the case is curved on one side , but then flat flat , so it's flipped into each other . 
UNKNOWN Flat on the top . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Can I pull the thing out the back of your computer ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , sure j Sorry , do you want me to What does um I_C_S_ mean ? 
UNKNOWN Just so we can Nothing , it's right , I'm just There we go . 
UNKNOWN I_C_s ? 
UNKNOWN Uh integrated circuits . 
CONFIRMATION Okay , cool . 
UNKNOWN So it's advanced integrated circuits ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh oh now I've gone too far . 
UNKNOWN Uh um we we're definitely going in for voice recognition as well as L_C_D_s , mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN We're on our way . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So we've basically worked out that we're going with a simple battery , the advanced chip and a curved on one side case which is folded in on itself , um made out of rubber and the buttons are also rubber . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN We're having push-buttons on the outside and then on the inside an L_C_D_ with spinning wheel , and we're incorporating voice recognition . 
UNKNOWN That's our overall concept , and it's gonna look sort of vegetable , and be in bright vegetable colours . 
UNKNOWN Um Uh-huh . 
UNKNOWN So w w would with have the spinning wheel inside with the L_C_D_ , or would it be on the outer Okay . 
UNKNOWN I think it's on the Mm-mm . 
UNKNOWN Imagine it would be inside . 
UNKNOWN So um actually that could like really cut down your thing , so you've got your outside , which is like minimalist , and then you open it up and you've got a screen and a spinning wheel , which you can incorporate buttons into . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , okay . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um so you've still not got like a lot of stuff in the You've maybe got , you know like if you're modelling on iPod you've got five buttons and a wheel , and four of the buttons are in the wheel , and the other one's the little bit inside the wheel , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN On the Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN In the centre , yeah , sure . 
UNKNOWN Mm yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so now we've got thirty minutes before our next meeting . 
UNKNOWN In the meantime , the Industrial Designer over here is gonna work on the look and feel design , which I'll presume he'll work out what that means . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um the User Interface Designer will work on the user interface design and the Marketing Expert is going to work on product evaluation . 
UNKNOWN And as well as that , the two designers are going to work together on our prototype following those instructions that we've just come up with using modelling clay and you will get extra instructions from your personal coach . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Cool . 
UNKNOWN Is that all okay ? 
UNKNOWN And anyone who hasn't put their their presentationin the project documentsfolder , it would be good just so in case we have to refer to it . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , okay . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Cool , I'm gonna go and sit on my own . 
UNKNOWN Y ah nobody wants to talk to you . 
UNKNOWN I know , I'm hated . 
UNKNOWN Unplug yourself . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN I've got a bit tangled up in all this . 
UNKNOWN So but shall I move away first or shall I stay here with we need to 
UNKNOWN I dunno , maybe I would car So what was what was this k ka Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN This is our final meeting , the detailed design meeting . 
UNKNOWN And again I'll take minutes. 
UNKNOWN The what we have to get through in this meeting is firstly the prototype presentationfrom you two , so you can show us what you've been working on so diligently . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um then then Cat's going to present the evaluation criteria that we're going to be evaluating this against . 
UNKNOWN It does look very cool . 
UNKNOWN Then I need to say some st a few things about finance , 'cause we have to check that it's within the finance criteria . 
UNKNOWN Um and then we'll be making sure that our product fits both the evaluation criteria from Cat and the financial limits . 
UNKNOWN Um and then we uh will have a brief evaluation of the whole process of production and design that we've been through . 
UNKNOWN So we've got forty minutes . 
UNKNOWN And then do we get to make a remote control ? 
UNKNOWN S 'Cause we missed out . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So it's now I guess that we're supposed to start at fifteen thirty five , so we've got until four fifteen . 
UNKNOWN Uh-huh . 
UNKNOWN Is that right ? 
UNKNOWN How how much do we have , forty minutes ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , about four fifteen , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , until about four fifteen . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so . 
UNKNOWN Go for it . 
UNKNOWN Do you want Yes . 
UNKNOWN So , you said um are are we starting with the the so will you maybe start with like the mm the shape and things and and then I will explain the the user interface th uh things , like the buttons and the scrolling things and Well , but it's it's just an a approximation . 
UNKNOWN Presentation. 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So um basically going with our trend of vegetables and we selected the colour and approximate shape of banana . 
UNKNOWN Um Yeah . 
UNKNOWN You think bananas are a safe thing to use ? 
UNKNOWN It's a bit um phallic . 
UNKNOWN Um Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Dual use , perfect . 
UNKNOWN Dual use , perfect . 
UNKNOWN Oh , your remote control ? 
UNKNOWN Oh that's just bad . 
UNKNOWN Does it vibrate when you press the buttons ? 
UNKNOWN Sorry , sorry . 
UNKNOWN Um so basically it's the it's the flip open thing again . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So now we we have the okay , so Ma Maarika will explain you the user interface there . 
UNKNOWN And it flips open on the side , so it opens like that . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN And we have the user interface o in here and uh the the L_C_D_ and and the scroll are inside . 
UNKNOWN Wow . 
UNKNOWN Um well , everything else is probably user interface , so . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh yeah . 
UNKNOWN And it's the whole thing's made of rubber , is that Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Rubber . 
UNKNOWN Oh yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , it has , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , . 
UNKNOWN Is it to scale , or do you think you can make it a bit smaller ? 
UNKNOWN Um it could be made a bit smaller , and and of course it would be and yeah , but um one thing we actually kind of um forgot while designing , that one side was supposed to be rounder , so we said the back side round , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , well , but i since it's made of rubber anyway . 
UNKNOWN I I think it's it's uh Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It l does look like the curvy and then the whole shape's curvy , so I would say that this curvy does look quite like a vegetable . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN And it's spongy as well . 
UNKNOWN I wasn't very keen on that , but yeah . 
UNKNOWN So so uh the user interface as as we discussed last time uh mm on on the on the cover we just have the very basic things . 
UNKNOWN Huh . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So we have that n uh channels here starting from um uh one two three there would be numbers in in the on the actual one . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So it's four , up to four , up to seven , up to nine and zero , z zero here . 
UNKNOWN Six seven eight nine . 
UNKNOWN I like that . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And then , well this is on off button . 
UNKNOWN It's it's quite standard mm place for it and and also the colour is quite often red , so it's it's kind of user friendly . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And then these ones would be for flipping the channels back and like the previous one and the next one . 
UNKNOWN Uh-huh . 
UNKNOWN And and we would also have a l little um thing saying here , previous and ne prevon prevon next . 
UNKNOWN So where's the volume ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN The volume is is scrolling . 
UNKNOWN On the side , this one . 
UNKNOWN It's on the side . 
UNKNOWN Ah , you did get that in then , mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah you just do it like this . 
UNKNOWN And and and it's it's on the back is mm cover or back lid , because if you flip it open , you can still do the scrolling here . 
UNKNOWN Oh okay , . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN See ? 
UNKNOWN So the volume is you just scroll , but then once you flip it open , okay , there there you have the screen and and you have the mm spinning wheel with options to choose . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN You can move back and forth and then if you need to m choose something on the screen , you just push the cen mm the middle button . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Cool . 
UNKNOWN Oh , the thing we forgot was like a mute button . 
UNKNOWN A mute button . 
UNKNOWN Uh no , we we'd not put so on on the cover we have the the bare essentials . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well , we'll have this on the screen , on the display . 
UNKNOWN Y or you could have it so you on the wheel if you . 
UNKNOWN On the wheel , like if you hold the wheel down then it will mute . 
UNKNOWN Uh on the L_C_D_ we r you know , the main menu will have various options . 
UNKNOWN Well , but the but the mute yeah , the scrolling is kind of you have to scroll all the way to make it mute , right ? 
UNKNOWN But if you hold it in , if it's a scroll and click so you hold it in ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but it's a scroll and click , isn't it ? 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Okay , yeah , okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay , cool . 
UNKNOWN So that that solves the whole mute issue . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And okay , so i so the the voice recognition is also just part of it . 
UNKNOWN You can't really see it in the interface . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , it's hidden in there somewhere . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And we do have the logo on it as well . 
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm , very good . 
UNKNOWN So I think it Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And it's with the the black and yellow you're even in the right colours . 
UNKNOWN . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I think um we could do l the logo in grey , as it is on the website . 
CONFIRMATION Cool . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN We ran out of resources here , so . 
UNKNOWN In the actual one . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So if you have questions . 
UNKNOWN You can have a look . 
UNKNOWN Very good , let's have a look . 
UNKNOWN Test it out . 
UNKNOWN . 
UNKNOWN Uh it's a sort of intermediate colour , I guess . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , oh , we hold the remote . 
UNKNOWN Oh , but it it does feel all cold and slimy . 
UNKNOWN I hate Play-Do , it's just minging . 
UNKNOWN But yeah , uh that's cool , cool . 
CONFIRMATION Very good . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so maybe if we go on to evaluation cri criteria and then we'll there I suspect we're gonna have a couple of minor finance issues , but um we'll se I'm sure we can get around them somehow . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , see the budget . 
UNKNOWN We'll just send all of our manufacturing to some nice poor country and cut some of the prices that way . 
UNKNOWN Wales . 
UNKNOWN Wales , for example . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Cool , okay . 
UNKNOWN Right , okay . 
UNKNOWN Fabulous , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Marketing Expert . 
CONFIRMATION Okay , cool . 
UNKNOWN So what we're gonna do is prefer prepare the evaluation of the new design . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um so we're gonna be using a seven point scale , so one is , you know , yes , it totally meets with that requirement and seven is , no , it really doesn't , we need to go back and start again . 
UNKNOWN Um , you know . 
UNKNOWN Basically , what I did was I went through all the like user requirements and things that we've done and we've worked on and like made a list of them . 
UNKNOWN Um you know , so that we can evaluate each one and like so it was about going back to the start and saying oh yeah , we did manage to do that , or oh no , we really forgot about that . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Okay ? 
UNKNOWN Cool , so these are what they are . 
UNKNOWN Oh Yes , I did have A_ , B_ , C_ , and D_ down here , but it seems to have turned into like just bullet points . 
UNKNOWN So for each of these we need to give it a one to seven . 
UNKNOWN Is that right ? 
UNKNOWN Mm dots , never mind . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN But if you can imagine that they say A_ , B_ , C_ , and D_ , then that would be really good . 
UNKNOWN I guess we'll give it maximum points in everything . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , the yeah , it's definitely attractive . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I agree . 
UNKNOWN Oh , the locatable thing we actually forgot . 
UNKNOWN Well , I thought we'd um kinda said that you'd have a little thing to stick on the T_V_ ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , just prepare one now . 
UNKNOWN Shall I just prepare it now ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It will be red , too . 
CONFIRMATION Cool . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So , be attractive to look at . 
UNKNOWN That's this one . 
UNKNOWN What do you all say ? 
UNKNOWN So ? 
UNKNOWN I reckon it Yeah . 
UNKNOWN S seven was th the maximum , yeah ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I I go for seven . 
UNKNOWN Seven , yeah , it's terribly sexy . 
UNKNOWN Oh we're all so proud of the . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so that'll be a seven for A_ . 
UNKNOWN Could oh no , you can't whilst that's up there . 
UNKNOWN Okay um uh what I've done on the next pageis I've set it up so we just put the marks in . 
UNKNOWN Ah , okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Excellent . 
UNKNOWN Except we can't uh we can if we then yeah , I'll take a note , it's fine . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But that's alright . 
UNKNOWN But we can we can I can I can take note uh uh Um the the only thing that we were considering was that uh this thing is kind of more for right-handed people than for left-handed people , so if you're left-handed you're kind of left uh scrolling with your finger . 
UNKNOWN If you take a note of them , and then I'll put them in in a minute . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so we're all agreeing on seven for A_ ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Cool , okay . 
UNKNOWN Does it match the operating behaviour of the user ? 
UNKNOWN I would think yes , yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think it does . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I mean Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , so y so we we might do we might want to do like a uh another m model another another version , which is like exactly the mirror image of this one . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
UNKNOWN But that's gonna be a problem , 'cause you don't always have all left-handers or all right-handers in a family . 
UNKNOWN But then yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So bu it's it's not a huge problem , because i i it is operatable . 
UNKNOWN I th I think it's not it's not like it's a pen . 
UNKNOWN But then then I think left-handed people are already used to discrimination anyway , so they just Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but I mean because it's not like it's a pen , you know , left-handed people can't normally write right-handed , but they can normally do most things right-handed , so I would say it's not such a big issue . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Yeah , because I mean anyway , right-handed people would be able to scroll with it , so i if the majority are right-handed , it's uh Or maybe six , because it's just one one i one among the issues , I mean . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I mean you can you can use your finger to to scroll rather than your thumb . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN So I mean that does kind of negate the whole R_S_I_ issue . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN So maybe we need to put that needs a little bit of investigation , maybe give it a five , I would say ? 
UNKNOWN Um Six . 
UNKNOWN What do you what do you all think ? 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I think I think for um I mean most people are right-handed , so in in terms of our greatest target group , I think it's pretty good , but we might want to flag it for management , they want might want to um They Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN One more thing is that i It might be a little clumsy when when it opens up , right , so it opens on the side . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN No , yeah , but mm but we have it nicely with the hinges here yeah . 
UNKNOWN So Yeah yeah yeah , I mean yeah . 
UNKNOWN So it won't be a problem , it will be and it will be it won't be heavy . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So you guys can decide wh whether Oops . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I th I think the alternative is flipping from the top . 
UNKNOWN Yeah well yeah , but it's it's a bit long . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but we which makes it kind of really big , yeah . 
UNKNOWN The length is gonna be difficu Mm . 
UNKNOWN It's a little bit long . 
UNKNOWN Well , I mean it can be opened like this of course and yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah um But you were thinking about making it smaller , yeah ? 
UNKNOWN Uh this this kind of uh makes it more and two , it might interfere with the I_R_ channel . 
UNKNOWN Because So you have to keep that side flat . 
UNKNOWN S uh slightly smaller . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but if we flip it open only as much as that . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So it works like a mobile phone flipping , but y you know , as long as that side's flat , than that will work . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um okay , so C_ . 
UNKNOWN Are are we admitting defeat on C_ or are we saying we're gonna stick a locator on the T_V_ ? 
UNKNOWN No , we're gonna put it like we've got th there's the locator dot . 
UNKNOWN No , we have a locator . 
UNKNOWN There's a locator . 
UNKNOWN Cool , so that means you need a that does mean you need a little speaker on it though , doesn't it ? 
UNKNOWN Mm that you stick on T_V_ . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN To make it beep . 
UNKNOWN Yeah well w but l but the speak sample speaker is included , so it it has some capacity to mm to do some to make some sounds , so yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Or a buzzer . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So that's two , so that's seven , yeah . 
UNKNOWN It's locatable ? 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN Fabulous . 
UNKNOWN D_ . 
UNKNOWN Intuitive , completely intuitive . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN If uh uh if this means intuitive , if it means the way people kind of are used to finding things and it's I th I think it's Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I'd say six , 'cause the I mean the the standard layoutfor numbers is three three three and one , rather than the way you've got it . 
UNKNOWN I really like the way you have it , but it's not the immediate thing that you're used to . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Intuitive . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , and I mean d So , should we maybe say f a five and say it is intuitive , but it's different , so , do you know , I mean it's obvious how to use it , but you might have to think about it first . 
UNKNOWN So Might be But it and it's something that they will be experiencing in a lot of different places soon . 
UNKNOWN And uh even the scroll , it's a it's a new technology so m m might be a little more difficult for people to get used to in the beginni so it is kind of not very intuitive but uh it's a good technology , I mean once they get used to it . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So l Yeah , okay . 
UNKNOWN Five ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So we give that one a five , you think ? 
UNKNOWN I'm happy with five ? 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN I'm gonna give a seven in everything , so . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I'm glad you're accepting this . 
UNKNOWN It has taken a little while , hasn't it ? 
UNKNOWN Um intuitive but Sorry , it's really hard to write on those . 
UNKNOWN I just went a bit mad , didn't I ? 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Um okay , cool , E_ , okay . 
UNKNOWN Um I would guess this comes back from this whole B_ thing links in here , so possibly for left-handed . 
UNKNOWN Investigate . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN But otherwise it's superb . 
UNKNOWN So , should we give it a six ? 
UNKNOWN Six . 
UNKNOWN Six ? 
UNKNOWN Um uh the ergonom ergonomic design well mm I mean I d uh I dunno , I mean the the repetitive stress things , but then who would be really pushing the buttons so much on the on the remote control anyway , yeah ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , unless you are a all the time sitting . 
UNKNOWN See . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , so it's kinda Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well we've banned them from Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I I think it is ergonomic . 
UNKNOWN I used to send fifty texts a day , you know , and I never got repetitive strain injury from that , so I find it quite hard to believe to be honest . 
UNKNOWN Mm yeah . 
UNKNOWN And moreover it it has um L_C_D_ and everything , so that uh you know uh we minimise the pressing of the buttons anyway . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , it's varied . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so we give that a six , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Six ? 
UNKNOWN Okay , F_ . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , it does have yeah . 
UNKNOWN Voice control have seven . 
UNKNOWN Absolutely . 
UNKNOWN Hang on , how come it's showing up with the things there but it only had bullet points there ? 
UNKNOWN That's just Oh okay , cool . 
UNKNOWN Ah , that's the second one . 
UNKNOWN So you must have changed it on this one where it's got score , but not on the previous slide. 
UNKNOWN Um right , so . 
UNKNOWN So it has voice control . 
UNKNOWN Yes , so that's a seven then . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN Um , cool . 
UNKNOWN G_ technologically innovative . 
UNKNOWN Anyway it ha yeah , it's the most sophisticated remote that I ever seen . 
UNKNOWN Technologi well Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But in terms of the actual technology , none of it is actually new . 
UNKNOWN Well mm we have we have the sample speaker as well , which is yeah , it's kind of new . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but I mean you don't They're never been used i they've never been using remote remote control before I don't think . 
UNKNOWN All of the components have been used in other things before . 
UNKNOWN But at the same time they are all they are all relatively new . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but they've been brought together in a remote . 
UNKNOWN But do yeah , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN What do you reckon , five , six ? 
UNKNOWN . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , what do you all think ? 
UNKNOWN Six . 
UNKNOWN Six ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I mean how how far can you go with a remote control , really ? 
UNKNOWN Well , that's it , I mean Yeah , but I mean everything has been used in space before it gets to anyone else really , hasn't it ? 
UNKNOWN It still has to do what i what it has to do . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So , I don't think many peop That's it , they can take it with them . 
UNKNOWN Space remote . 
UNKNOWN Put fashion in electronics . 
UNKNOWN Absolutely . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , isn't it fashionable ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , sure . 
UNKNOWN The carrot banana remote . 
UNKNOWN It's the maximum fashion . 
UNKNOWN So , we give it seven , and we write There we go . 
UNKNOWN Fruit fruit and vegetables are fashionable these days , so . 
UNKNOWN So I think we've done very well , but What's the assessment ? 
UNKNOWN I think that's a . 
CONFIRMATION Cool . 
CONFIRMATION Very good . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So , we need the average here , so we got Seven So we've got four sevens , so that's twenty eight , three sixes , eighteen . 
UNKNOWN The average is about six and something . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , one . 
UNKNOWN A little bit over six . 
UNKNOWN Or a seven . 
UNKNOWN There are how many sixes ? 
UNKNOWN No , wait , a little bit under six . 
UNKNOWN One , two , three . 
UNKNOWN No , wait . 
UNKNOWN Three . 
UNKNOWN And one five . 
UNKNOWN Oh , three sixes , okay , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Fifty one , one , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight . 
UNKNOWN Okay , twenty eight , thirty eight , fo forty six . 
UNKNOWN Four sevens . 
UNKNOWN Forty six and five , fifty one . 
UNKNOWN Six point point about six point five . 
UNKNOWN Fifty one divided by Mm I guess it'll have to wait for a bit . 
UNKNOWN Six point something , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Two three four Seven eight . 
UNKNOWN Six point five , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Close enough . 
UNKNOWN Okay , that's pretty good , I think . 
UNKNOWN Now wait until we get to finance and then we'll see if we can afford it . 
UNKNOWN That's all you've got at the moment , or did you have anything more ? 
UNKNOWN Um no , that's it , yeah . 
UNKNOWN That's it ? 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
UNKNOWN So , finance . 
UNKNOWN And we'll see if we can unscrew this first . 
UNKNOWN Cool , there we go . 
UNKNOWN Sorry , this is I'm just um Beautiful . 
UNKNOWN . 
UNKNOWN There we go and there are the marks . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Not anymore . 
UNKNOWN Computer no signal ? 
UNKNOWN Adjusting . 
UNKNOWN There we go . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so we've looked at the prototype presentationand the evaluation criteria . 
UNKNOWN And now we have to calculate the production costs . 
UNKNOWN So I've got an Excel spreadsheetto help us do that . 
UNKNOWN Can you read that ? 
UNKNOWN Almost . 
UNKNOWN More or less . 
UNKNOWN Um I started filling it in , but of course these are provisional , so we have to go down . 
UNKNOWN No hand dynamo , right ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN One simple battery . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN No kinetic energy , no solar . 
UNKNOWN The chip , we're going for an advanced chip on print. 
UNKNOWN Advanced , yeah . 
UNKNOWN We also said the sample sensor and sample speaker . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN Um single-curved surface , so that we can fold it . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , yes . 
UNKNOWN Case material we said rubber . 
UNKNOWN Rubber . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN I don't know what special colour means . 
UNKNOWN Mm anything uh I think which is not more . 
UNKNOWN I think something coloured , yeah , probably . 
UNKNOWN So I think this is probably special co no ? 
UNKNOWN It could be Rub rubber comes coloured , it's I would maybe it's like if you want titanium coloured or wood coloured , it's different . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but rubber comes coloured , doesn't it ? 
UNKNOWN You know . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Or maybe maybe if you want some kind of pattern thing on it , yeah yeah , okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , let's leave it as zero , 'cause it's easy . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , you might end up having to take off the sample sensor . 
UNKNOWN We we're definitely going to have to so we've got pushbutton , and then we've Scroll wheel with pushbutton we had , no ? 
UNKNOWN We have pushbuttons , scro we have scroll wheel as well . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN S for the muting . 
UNKNOWN S yeah , yeah , we had , for muting , yeah . 
UNKNOWN No uh we we have uh yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And we have L_C_ display and yeah . 
UNKNOWN And button supplements . 
UNKNOWN Um Yeah , but what do we ha we have L_C_ display , but but the wh but the s spinning wheel Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Mm no . 
UNKNOWN . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN We don't have we're not using any of that . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN No ? 
UNKNOWN But the the spinning wheel's not there . 
UNKNOWN I have think maybe it's integrated with the L_C_ display ? 
UNKNOWN Okay , let's yeah . 
UNKNOWN We've got more than one pushbutton though , haven't we ? 
UNKNOWN I think the pushbutton oh . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause then you have That means you can only have twenty five push buttons in total doesn't it ? 
UNKNOWN I don't know if that's one Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Not counting anything , we'd still be in budget . 
UNKNOWN That seems unlikely . 
UNKNOWN Push what uh whether whether pushbutton means that p count by button or do we I don't think that makes sense . 
UNKNOWN Huh ? 
UNKNOWN Wh wh what is the limit ? 
CONFUSION Uh . 
UNKNOWN Twelve point five . 
UNKNOWN We have to count all of them , or yeah . 
UNKNOWN Mm I don't think so , no . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN Well it doesn't , but it uh And L_C_ display . 
UNKNOWN No it says what what is the kind of interface , if it is pushbutton then you got a zero point five , it's a scroll wheel so we we've put it's pushbutton and scroll wheel and L_C_D_ display , so that's that's the three kind of interfaces that we have . 
NEGATION No . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So , as we can see , that's way too expensive down here . 
UNKNOWN Wh wh what's our criteria ? 
UNKNOWN This sample sensor . 
UNKNOWN Our budget's twelve point five . 
UNKNOWN Uh okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , the sample sensor will have to go , 'cause that's the most expensive thing on there . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , so that has implications though for the . 
UNKNOWN Uh it does not have for voice recognition , but it does have for the feedback speaker . 
UNKNOWN when you say when you press one it says one or it says hello . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN For the locator . 
UNKNOWN But that's a bit of a gimmick anyway really , isn't it ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Mm and the locator also goes away . 
UNKNOWN We can afford to get rid of it . 
UNKNOWN But it was very no innovative innovativeness . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So that means no locator , does it ? 
UNKNOWN Well um yeah . 
UNKNOWN I mean does Yeah . 
UNKNOWN What else does it need ? 
UNKNOWN Well the speaker uh the sample speaker is is expensive , but we could just have some some very very easy device that just beeps . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , 'cause the sample speaker was , I think , more complicated then just a beeping thing . 
UNKNOWN This would be Yeah , yeah yeah there you record your samples your speech samples and Yeah , then then we would be in the b budget . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , okay , so we Uh-huh . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN A also i in the case I'm not sure that you will evaluate this as a curved surface , because it's just rubber , so it's probably a flat surface rubber . 
UNKNOWN Uh I mean uh um yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Right , so we need one fifty off . 
UNKNOWN Um So tha that mean that we cannot press how do we how do we make a selection in uh in the L_C_D_ ? 
UNKNOWN See , I was gonna say the scroll wheel pushbutton thing , 'cause But that's well you would just have to to spin it down . 
UNKNOWN Take it down to just a scroll wheel . 
UNKNOWN We could do Yeah . 
UNKNOWN If in the L_C_D_ we can scroll , right ? 
UNKNOWN But how do we make a selection if we d cannot push the button . 
UNKNOWN Yeah b no no , you can push this one , but we don't have a pushbutton uh we ca we don't have this muting mechanism for this scrolling thing . 
UNKNOWN You can have to scroll it straight r roll it straight down for for mute . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So that's point three . 
UNKNOWN No w w w but ha it's it's the scroll wheel and I thought we were referring to this as a scroll spinning wheel and pushbutton thing . 
UNKNOWN But I mean we can put an additional mute button on the top as well . 
UNKNOWN If you Mm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I mean that wouldn't actually cost any more . 
UNKNOWN That's the spin wheel though , isn't it ? 
UNKNOWN Didn't that come with the L_C_ Yeah . 
UNKNOWN That's with the L_C_ We decided , 'cause it's not on our list . 
UNKNOWN That comes with the L_C_D_ ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Oh so so the the this is . 
UNKNOWN The scroll wheel is on the side . 
UNKNOWN So we're adding costs for right , okay uh I mean I think this is good . 
UNKNOWN So Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN S so we're point three over . 
UNKNOWN We're point three over at the moment . 
UNKNOWN It's nothing n Yeah , I have Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Unless we just take off the scroll wheel altogether and just have pushbuttons for the volume . 
UNKNOWN Could b still put them on the side . 
UNKNOWN But yeah . 
UNKNOWN I mean the scroll wheel's pretty cool , but Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Instead of scrolling here we have two buttons here , up for up and down . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN On the side . 
UNKNOWN Mm uh it sounds good actually , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Rather than having three different things that people have to do . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN There we go . 
UNKNOWN . 
UNKNOWN Oh look , we're way under budget and we'll make huge profits and we'll all get bonuses . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , well we could admit to the single curve , couldn't we ? 
UNKNOWN Or or that we have to have some sort of special colour . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So that's alright . 
UNKNOWN We we'll leave it at that and then I'll take I can send it back to management and say we weren't quite sure about the colour , if that costs extra then we've still got some space for it , yeah . 
UNKNOWN We have , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Excellent . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
UNKNOWN So did we lose um on our evaluation criteria , as a result of doing that ? 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN No , I don't think so . 
UNKNOWN Not really , no . 
UNKNOWN Because we keep all the features , we keep voice recognition , we keep L_C_D_ display . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN We instead of having scrolling we we just push the buttons . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN We just got rid of a gimmick that was never anyway , and the scroll wheel is I mean essentially the two buttons that was it's not a great difference I don't think . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Alright then . 
UNKNOWN But we lose the locator . 
UNKNOWN Really ? 
UNKNOWN We're gonna have a beep . 
UNKNOWN Well we're going to have a beeping thing . 
UNKNOWN So instead of speaker , . 
UNKNOWN But yeah , it's it's not like sample speaker , but it will just beep , so we still have the locate . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
CONFIRMATION Cool . 
UNKNOWN That's not a very exciting colour . 
UNKNOWN I think you should make it more vegetable-like . 
UNKNOWN Which colour , the the colour of the phone or the colour of the But it can be yellow as well . 
UNKNOWN Tha . 
UNKNOWN Oh the the beeper thing . 
UNKNOWN It Yeah , I think Jen wants it to vibrate . 
UNKNOWN It can come in the same colour as the the case . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause we we won't have run out of our pot of Play-Doh . 
UNKNOWN You know , your pen vibrates ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I know I know , my pen vibrates . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But only for a very short time . 
UNKNOWN Um okay . 
UNKNOWN So looks like we've designed a banana . 
UNKNOWN Well done , team . 
UNKNOWN Um we need we've just got about ten minutes or so left of the meeting , so it would be good if we could just have a little talk about the project itself and how it went , um so that we can feed back to the management for next time they're designing a product . 
CONFIRMATION Cool . 
UNKNOWN Feedback ? 
UNKNOWN I think it mm I think uh n one thing that was lacking uh was that we did not know what the various things cost to begin with . 
UNKNOWN Ideas ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah mm , as far as creativity is concerned , yeah I think there was there was room for creativity . 
UNKNOWN The only the only problem being that at the end we had to cut some things down because of the the budget we had . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um we kap kept a adding things randomly . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So , had we known Yeah , that or not , yeah . 
UNKNOWN If we'd had that sheetat the beginning should've been like , okay , so we can have that lot , let's just throw it together and do what we can . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So d all the random decisions at the end could have been prevented . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN But in terms of the process of um going and working individually and then coming back to a meeting , that that worked in terms of . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , mm . 
UNKNOWN I think 'cause the meetings were so regular , you know . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN It wasn't like we were alone for very long , so you didn't st go off and think , wouldn't it be great to have a vibrating remote control shaped like a banana , and then , you know , come back three days later and Jen's going look , look , it vibrates and it looks like a banana . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Banana . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um yeah , so yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , the m the means were very very good , the means we used . 
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm , the whiteboard digital pens . 
UNKNOWN And the pens . 
UNKNOWN Uh I like the pens . 
UNKNOWN We like the pens . 
UNKNOWN I want one . 
UNKNOWN That would just be so cool , to d do all your notesand s I don't think you should say that was the recording . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , you could take it to lectures and just write stuff down and have it printed out when you got back to the office . 
UNKNOWN Yeah yeah yeah , that's it's it's I wonder what one of these costs . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah . 
UNKNOWN They great ? 
UNKNOWN Do you think they'd notice if one went ? 
UNKNOWN Oh okay . 
UNKNOWN Okay , cover up the microphone . 
UNKNOWN Alright , let's take it . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN Shh . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN But that worked well having having a whiteboard that we could drawon as well as having the PowerPoint, 'cause the I find that the problem with PowerPointoften is that it's so static and you can't change it once you're in there , yep . 
UNKNOWN It is a bit limiting , isn't it ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , and and and this time also the time limits but actually preparing the Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN The thing flew in , you didn't have the whole whooshing thing , 'cause there wasn't time for that , so yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN That's alright , that always irritates me anyway , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Not that you can do that on the board , either . 
UNKNOWN We could make some little Yeah , totally , I mean that was fairly tight anyway , I mean especially with that last-minute alteration . 
UNKNOWN But yeah , but I mean already just just preparing the slidesbefore before the meeting , yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Mm yeah . 
UNKNOWN back it , this is just had to be changed . 
UNKNOWN And yeah , so cool . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Are we supposed to say nice things about Jen now ? 
UNKNOWN And presumably you don't you can say nasty things as well . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I was I was satisfied with with the leadership , yeah . 
UNKNOWN I have no stake in it . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , definitely . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN You weren't like a a dictating leader , so that was always good . 
UNKNOWN You have to say that , 'cause I'm taking the notes. 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN I'll leave the room and you can have another go . 
UNKNOWN I know you've got the pen , you might attack me with it . 
UNKNOWN Better than that than the banana . 
UNKNOWN And then the teamwork I think I think it worked quite quite nicely , yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think it worked quite well . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Did anyone feel that they were getting sort of covered up and not being able to say their bit ? 
UNKNOWN To express them mm mm no . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN I guess it was a fairly small group , so all of us got to express our opinions , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN . 
UNKNOWN New ideas found . 
UNKNOWN Not quite sure what about . 
UNKNOWN Well it's it's it's pretty new , pretty novel solution for a for a remote control really , all this flipping open thing and Yeah , neither neither do I , but I've never seen anything and and none of my examples were was was like this , actually , so . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I don't know , I don't go shopping for remote controls that often , maybe somebody's already though of it . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I'll be looking out next time I need to write an essay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's right . 
UNKNOWN That looks boring , I'll see if anyone's made a remote control . 
UNKNOWN Yeah maybe w maybe we could have a patent on this one . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Patent patent patent . 
UNKNOWN Banana remote . 
UNKNOWN I think we'd like to think the ideas were new , but we've got no way of finding out . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Or you can always go to Google and type in banana remote control . 
UNKNOWN That vibrates Yeah , but that would just come up with like other things really wouldn't it . 
UNKNOWN Flip . 
UNKNOWN Vibrate . 
UNKNOWN And uh yeah . 
UNKNOWN Nothing that you really want . 
UNKNOWN True . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So , costs are within budget , well within budget , including a little what have we got ? 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN One Euro left over for bits that we didn't foresee . 
UNKNOWN Um we've evaluated the project . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN You've got the scores . 
UNKNOWN And it's fabulous . 
UNKNOWN Can you put that in the project documentsfile? 
UNKNOWN It's in the project documents. 
UNKNOWN It's in there already . 
UNKNOWN And the process wheel didn't really have any major problems with . 
UNKNOWN Were there any was there anything that you found difficult , or anything that didn't go as smoothly as you'd hope ? 
UNKNOWN And my main difficulty was the the time pressure . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Otherwise it's it's all fine . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah , sometimes it's like a little bit rushed . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN I thought that was good though , because if you're given too much time then you got nothing to do with your time and um yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Although we could have made the R_s better had we had five more minute. 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay then . 
UNKNOWN Um I think we're still well within our time . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , we've got like five minutes left . 
UNKNOWN We've got about five minutes left , but if we've finished , then we've finished . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN We're just too too efficient and you should never drag a meeting on just because you have extra time . 
UNKNOWN We certainly are , mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN So I would say that's the end of that meeting . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , it was a pleasure working with you . 
THANKS Thank you , team . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN It was very productive day and Mm uh no . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , same here . 
UNKNOWN We could drawanimals on the board again . 
UNKNOWN Mm uh no . 
UNKNOWN I don't think so . 
UNKNOWN You can make some animals . 
UNKNOWN I don't like Play-Doh , no . 
UNKNOWN Oh , you don't like anim It doesn't ? 
UNKNOWN It's just minging . 
UNKNOWN It smells so bad . 
UNKNOWN It does . 
UNKNOWN Smells quite nice . 
UNKNOWN Smells very sweet . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Right , so we have to complete the final questionnaire and meeting summary when they send it . 
UNKNOWN Was there a questionnaire already sent ? 
UNKNOWN I don't know if it's already sent or not . 
UNKNOWN No , it hasn't been . 
UNKNOWN Um presumably I have to I don't see why you can't stay here , really . 
UNKNOWN Do we have to go back into the other room or can we stay in here now ? 
UNKNOWN Okay , so the other way . 
UNKNOWN Did I save this one ? 
UNKNOWN Production costs . 
UNKNOWN I made your animal for you . 
UNKNOWN It was supposed to be pink . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's the one 
UNKNOWN But it was blue on the board . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Ooh . 
UNKNOWN So we're 'kay ? 
UNKNOWN On the or No . 
UNKNOWN I dunno where to put it 'cause the Okay . 
UNKNOWN Could you s take it off ? 
UNKNOWN . 
UNKNOWN Is that alright ? 
UNKNOWN or Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Keeps coming off . 
UNKNOWN 'S fiddly . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN How do we sta wa how do we start ? 
UNKNOWN Does anybody know ? 
UNKNOWN Oh , another one . 
UNKNOWN So that's this Oh okay , right . 
UNKNOWN Are we free to take notesuh Okay . 
CONFUSION Uh . 
UNKNOWN . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Okay , just hang on a second everybody . 
UNKNOWN I haven't actually looked at this yet . 
UNKNOWN Ah . 
UNKNOWN um I haven't looked at it , but let's just start it off and we'll see what happens . 
CONFIRMATION Very nice . 
UNKNOWN If you're all ready . 
UNKNOWN So is the agenda? 
UNKNOWN Opening , acquaintance , tool training and project plan , discussion and then closing . 
UNKNOWN Project aim is a new remote control . 
UNKNOWN It's original , uh trendy and it's user-friendly . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN Project method , functional design , individual work , another meeting , conceptual design , individual work , and a meeting of details design , individual work and a meeting . 
UNKNOWN Tool training . 
UNKNOWN Try out the whiteboard , every participant should drawtheir favourite animal and sum up their favourite characteristics of that animal . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Uh Miss Industrial Designer , would you like to go first ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So are we supposed to bring the little things for the Mm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , why don't you just c , I think just clip on clip do you have a belt ? 
UNKNOWN Clip . 
UNKNOWN Or put 'em in your pocket , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So my favourite animal 'Kay um Um okay , it's big , it's got a great memory . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , what's your favourite animal ? 
UNKNOWN Ah . 
UNKNOWN Is it rude ? 
UNKNOWN It's an elephant . 
UNKNOWN That's a very good elephant . 
UNKNOWN The back end of an elephant . 
UNKNOWN Oh my gosh , I'm never gonna be able to drawthat well . 
UNKNOWN 'Kay , and you want to write up on there , it says you've gotta sum up your f f your favourite characteristics of that animal . 
UNKNOWN Does it ? 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN Supposed to have a great memory , we say an elephant never forgets . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN And uh dunno know why but looks like nice to me . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Nice animal . 
UNKNOWN Wonderful , well done . 
UNKNOWN Do you want to use the wipe the m the wiper and wipe it off ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN And Mister aesthetics designer do you wanna go next ? 
UNKNOWN Aesthetic yep , sure . 
UNKNOWN I have no idea what my favourite animal is . 
UNKNOWN 'Kay , my favourite animal , uh let's see . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN It's A what ? 
UNKNOWN Dunno if any of you have seen Napoleon Dynamite before . 
UNKNOWN It's a liger , a combination of a lion and tiger . 
NEGATION No . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
UNKNOWN Have you not seen Napoleon Dynamite ? 
UNKNOWN How . 
NEGATION No . 
NEGATION No . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN Oh it's a hilarious movie . 
UNKNOWN You have to see it . 
UNKNOWN And and it's best characteristic is it's pretty much the awesomest animal . 
UNKNOWN But you have to see the movie to fully appreciate it . 
UNKNOWN Okay , well done . 
CONFIRMATION Great . 
UNKNOWN Me ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Miss mar Miss Marketing ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Not quite sure how this is gonna work . 
UNKNOWN There go . 
CONFIRMATION Cool . 
UNKNOWN Uh well I'll try my best to draw. 
UNKNOWN Can I just drawthe face ? 
UNKNOWN Um yeah , I think you can just drawthe face , but then you'll have to describe in writing how the rest of it looks . 
UNKNOWN Ooh . 
UNKNOWN It's a cat . 
UNKNOWN That's a very pr pretty cat . 
UNKNOWN Which also has what ? 
UNKNOWN A big fat body and big and a long tail . 
UNKNOWN Okay , do y do you wanna do some write you wanna just write some words about it ? 
UNKNOWN Why ? 
UNKNOWN Because um cuddly . 
UNKNOWN And usually cats are very friendly . 
UNKNOWN Usually . 
UNKNOWN And they're healing as well . 
UNKNOWN They heal . 
UNKNOWN And they can feel when a human's got problems so So , that's why I like cats . 
UNKNOWN Wow , so they're kinda spiritual . 
UNKNOWN Well done . 
UNKNOWN There we are , that's me . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Um , I don't actually have a favourite animal , but for the for th for this meeting I'll s drawa little Uh . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN I honestly can't drawfor toffee . 
CONFUSION Uh . 
UNKNOWN Really ? 
UNKNOWN Oh that's a Not bad I would say . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN no no uh That's exactly what it is . 
UNKNOWN A prairie dog ? 
UNKNOWN Oh a squirrel ? 
UNKNOWN Uh not a very good one Okay , well , you got it's a s It's a squirrel , and I like them , because they're cute and stupid . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's pretty good . 
CONFIRMATION Very good . 
UNKNOWN Ah . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Okay , so , I guess that was the test to see if this equipment is all working . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Let's move on to the next page. 
UNKNOWN Okay , project finance , selling price twenty five Euros , profit aim fifty million Euros . 
UNKNOWN Market range internationally sold . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Production cost , ah right it's gotta be can't cost any more than twelve fifty to make . 
UNKNOWN Ah right okay . 
UNKNOWN experience with with remote control , so talk about who who's used what . 
UNKNOWN Any ideas ? 
UNKNOWN Stuff like that . 
UNKNOWN Next meeting starts in thirty minutes . 
UNKNOWN At quarter to twelve . 
UNKNOWN So I think before we close uh , we are expected I mean the last slidewanted us to maybe discuss longer what our what our ideas where . 
UNKNOWN I mean if you wanna go back to the last slide. 
UNKNOWN Uh S Yeah , I think we're I mean before we close the meeting , we're supposed to come up with some ideas for Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Oh k so we're actually supposed to be doing this discussion like right now are we or oh okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I thought this was just t giving us instructions for the re to do next , but Okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I think this is just the preliminary , get some rough ideas for what our experiences with remote controls have been and and what we would roughly what we would incorporate into a new one maybe . 
UNKNOWN Right , who's got experiences with remote controls then ? 
UNKNOWN Pretty much everybody . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I think we've all got Mm . 
CONFUSION Uh . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Is this a T_V_ one we are supposed to make ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah it's a T_V_ remote control . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN 'Kay um . 
UNKNOWN Well . 
UNKNOWN T But how do we know how much uh , I mean , how much do we have per how much ? 
UNKNOWN A new remote control for T_V_ . 
UNKNOWN What would I like ? 
UNKNOWN W what You want it big do you want it small . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Medium . 
UNKNOWN Are we are we going for like like telephones are going little teeny tiny things or we are going for something that's that's big and Video and ts hi-fi and stuff . 
UNKNOWN Yeah it seems like there's like there's sort of a tension between two ideas , I mean , you want you want one remote that maybe can work uh all all of the functions of T_V_ and if you have whatever associated with T_V_ the D_V_D_ player , or something like that , but like at the same time you don't wanna really busy remote with a thousand buttons on it or something . 
UNKNOWN Maybe you yeah now th that's the other thing is it's gotta be cheap . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause I I I mean I was thinking something that's got different like maybe a a an L_C_D_ display on it that's got different pagesfor different devices , but that would p that would probably be quite expensive . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Twelve fifty . 
UNKNOWN Twelve fifty . 
UNKNOWN It g can't be more than twelve fifty per unit . 
UNKNOWN Each . 
UNKNOWN Per unit , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Cost . 
UNKNOWN So do we have to be realistic within the budget or Close pr I don't know how much it would cost . 
UNKNOWN Well at the moment we could , wa I mean we 'cause we this is what we th what we're doing at the moment is just saying what what we'd like , and then after we after we've found out what we can like , some different ideas , we can then go and do the research to find out if these any of these ideas are feasible or not . 
UNKNOWN Guess Couldn't we have like one that comes out ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN So would be nice to have something that that controls lots of different things . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Like so you have one in like mm it doesn't have to be really thick . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I mean remote controls can be thin bits . 
UNKNOWN And then you have one for your D_V_D_ and you sort of slideit out , and then you have another one , you slideit out . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN have slides. 
UNKNOWN And then it all comes compact into one . 
UNKNOWN Okay , that's . 
UNKNOWN So it's not you actually just putting three or four different remotes together but making them thinner , and um into one basically . 
UNKNOWN Th that's an idea . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So you just flip them out . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um have uh one very complicated one on one side with all the D_V_D_ and V_C_R_ access and stuff , and then on the other side o one uh a remote control that would be very very simple with just the channel , program plus and minus , and the just the mute button , for example . 
UNKNOWN I can real keep it really really simple on one side and the other side be very complicated . 
UNKNOWN One side for kids , one side for adults . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I'm not sure if that's like I'm not sure if it's a good idea to have a two sided remote though , 'cause it would be very hard to use in the way that you mani manipulate it . 
UNKNOWN Or grandma as well , you know it's like what is the mute button . 
UNKNOWN No , but you would slideit into uh someth like something on the back would hold like you wouldn't be able to press the buttons , but Start breaking up . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN Oh okay . 
UNKNOWN Like it or something like a flip telephone , something like that maybe . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN That would be cool . 
UNKNOWN I was thinking that like a flip . 
UNKNOWN F flip it open and you've got all the buttons , or you flip it closed and you've just got the basic buttons on the outside maybe . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um , oh we've got five minutes left . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN But okay . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Well we've got a k we've got a few ideas there . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , we should uh I guess by the end of this meeting we should have at least a a rough conception you know stage one was technical functions design , what effect the apparatus should have . 
UNKNOWN . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um so I mean we still have time in our next meeting to come up with the actual concept for the user interface , but the the functions that we're sure that we want are that it can control the T_V_ , but also devices connected to the to the T_V_ , I mean , be able to operate D_V_D_ players , things like that . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I have got I think we should also have a back-up plan of I 'cause I I I just think that it might be expensive to make something that I mean we don't , we haven't been told it has to be something that will control everything . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN We should have a back-up plan of just a really good television remote control , that just that is just for a T_V_ , but it's just a really good , nice one . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN What do you reckon ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I mean . 
UNKNOWN See 'cause , I'm just thinking bearing in mind th we've gotta we have to have something that's cheap to make . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's true , maybe we should just concentrate on having a a good T_V_ remote , and have it be um have it be like ergonomic so it's comfortable to use , uh simple to use , and looks decent and Sorta find a niche for our remote , like market it to a certain kind of p kind of people , certain certain demographic Yeah , no I think you're right . 
UNKNOWN I think we'll be able to come up with ideas and stuff a lot quicker . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN May w you know , maybe even Or maybe even so something that's for disabled people or so people that uh b don't see very well or big buttons for touchy buttons for Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But what'll make it what'll make it interesting for people to buy though ? 
UNKNOWN I mean if it's if it's just like Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Or just one that looks really fucking cool . 
UNKNOWN Could be really light or , I dunno , something special . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , rathe rather than focus on Y Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Otherwise we'll be we'll be here all day talking about do this let's do that n I think we sh I think we should Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , 'cause at the end of the day if it says just T_V_ remote , doesn't say com combination with all all the r Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I mean obviously everyone we're uh you know uh sounds like we're all a bit sort of gadget heads and we like things that do everything at once , but you know , that's Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Remotes spinning out from other remotes and having little nested remotes inside . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's right . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I mean I'd like one that makes tea as well , but that's not gonna happen . 
UNKNOWN I think a flip up thing , 'cause you always have this problem of like if it's on this well I did anyway , like we had five or six remotes and they would be lying on the c on the coach , and you'd come and sit down and ooh , the telephone's the television switched on or something . 
UNKNOWN So maybe something that like does have a lid or closes , so you don't accidentally press a button or record button for something . 
UNKNOWN Okay , like a lock f like a lock functs function on it like you have on your telephones , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But make it like really snazzy and cool people will want it . 
UNKNOWN So make it Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , it's gotta be sellable . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's true what you were saying , I mean it doesn't have to have a flip function , it can just have a lock function , so that it's not uh not usable when you don't want it to be usable . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN And even for kids as well . 
UNKNOWN It's um it's safer for them , I guess . 
UNKNOWN Like they don't flick onto channels and all that sl flick onto . 
UNKNOWN No porn channel for children . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um alright , so we've got some ideas , we've got um Let's move on . 
UNKNOWN I guess that's good good for now . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Oops , let's close that . 
UNKNOWN Next meeting , uh okay . 
UNKNOWN W What does I_D_V_I_D_N_M_E_ stand for ? 
UNKNOWN Industrial Designer um which is Um . 
UNKNOWN Ah ri okay . 
UNKNOWN these are requirement specification . 
UNKNOWN That's Mm . 
UNKNOWN And I'm marketing . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , there you go . 
UNKNOWN So User Interface Designer , that's that's that's you , so you gotta you go , you're you're gonna be the one that's working out what what buttons we need . 
UNKNOWN That's me . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
CONFIRMATION Right .
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Industrial Designer , you are the one , you know , you're gonna be working out kind of box it goes in , I guess so , um whether it's what goes into the box , somehow . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Har how it works an Bu Do you think our two kind of overlap , because Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And in marketing User requirements specifications . 
UNKNOWN These are requirement specification . 
UNKNOWN So what the user requires in a remote . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , what Right , okay , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , it does seem like our our responsibilities have some overlap . 
UNKNOWN I guess that's what it says . 
UNKNOWN You two you two are gonna be just , I think , you just double up , you know , you working together . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN You're the one that's gotta go and find out do th do the research , see what people want in a remote , what buttons are used more often , and s stuff like that . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Oh , we've been warned to finish the meeting now . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Okay everyone , well done . 
UNKNOWN Good meeting . 
UNKNOWN Alright , see you in thirty minutes . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So , do we take these off ? 
UNKNOWN I don't Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Think we can first . 
UNKNOWN Right it was function F_ eight or something . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN This one right there . 
UNKNOWN Tha Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Who is gonna do a PowerPointpresentation? 
UNKNOWN Think we all Huh . 
UNKNOWN You will as well ? 
UNKNOWN Oh I thought we all were . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I have one too , okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN S Whoops I forgot to put the thing on Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN I just wanna 'cause basically I can't re I've really crap at remembering everyone's name so I just wanna rather than going uh Miss Marketing and Miss this and Miss that wanted to know your names again . 
UNKNOWN Okay I'm Okay . 
UNKNOWN just gonna leave this up here 'cause I'll you know . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Sure , that's a good idea . 
UNKNOWN So Okay , and Gabriel . 
UNKNOWN I'm Catherine with a C_ . 
UNKNOWN C_A_T_H_ E_R_ I_N_E_ . 
UNKNOWN Uh Gabriel . 
UNKNOWN E_L_ is it ? 
UNKNOWN E_L_ . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN And you're s r R_E_I_S_S_ Okay . 
UNKNOWN I am Reissa . 
UNKNOWN R_E_I_S_S_A_ . 
UNKNOWN Double S_ A_ , yeah yeah . 
UNKNOWN Sorry . 
UNKNOWN 'S just a bit nicer calling people by their names I think . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN True . 
UNKNOWN Uh , right . 
UNKNOWN Mm 'kay . 
UNKNOWN Okay , right , welcome to meeting B_ . 
UNKNOWN Um this is gonna go a lot better than the last meeting , basically , uh 'cause I know what I'm supposed to be doing now . 
UNKNOWN I am your Project Manager , and , uh yeah , I'm just here to sort of liaise between the three of you and get things going , get people talking and and I'm gonna be making notesand sending them off to the powers that be and stuff basically . 
UNKNOWN Um right , this for the purposes of this meeting what this meeting is all about is um I'm gonna have some presentationsfrom all three of you , what you've been working on for the last wee while , when you haven't been getting hit with spam on your computers and and , you know , filling out silly questionnaires and things . 
UNKNOWN But hopefully you've been actually been doing something productive . 
UNKNOWN So we're gonna each of you gonna give us a litt a little presentation. 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Then we're gonna work , you know , from each of your presentations. 
UNKNOWN We'll we'll uh talk about what we actually need as a final coming together of it all . 
UNKNOWN Um and then we'll , yeah , we'll sort of conclude anything else comes up at the end of it . 
UNKNOWN How long is the meeting ? 
UNKNOWN This meeting it's not very long . 
UNKNOWN It's uh probably down to about thirty five minutes now . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So I want each of your presentationsto not be too long , five five minutes , something like that . 
UNKNOWN No problem . 
UNKNOWN Um if you haven't done a PowerPointthingy , it doesn't matter , it it just it just says that you it's that's just one particular medium . 
UNKNOWN If you haven't had time to prepare one , you can drawstuff on the noteboard, you can talk to us , you can you know however you want to do your little presentation, basically , you can . 
UNKNOWN Don't feel pressurised into using this thing . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause I don't . 
UNKNOWN Uh okay . 
UNKNOWN So um . 
UNKNOWN You okay over there ? 
UNKNOWN Reissa , are you uh b are you joining in with this meeting here or are y or are y or are you are you just are you just uh doing some Internet shopping there ? 
UNKNOWN I'm fine . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I uh yeah , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Think she's finishing up her presentation. 
UNKNOWN D I mean , I I'm finishing off my presentation. 
UNKNOWN No no . 
UNKNOWN Uh I'm done . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Okay , jolly good . 
UNKNOWN Alright , let's have um well , we all know that it's it's a remote control that we're gonna be dealing with . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN I think the first thing we should look at is um probably the um what it is that it is actually supposed to be . 
UNKNOWN So that's gonna be you Catherine , if we wanna hear from you first . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um just connecting this . 
UNKNOWN Are we getting i Really ? 
UNKNOWN You don't have to worry about screwing it in just there you go . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Cool . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So I've got a very quick uh Uh . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So the working design , I've got a very quick presentationon this , so um I've oh no , you can't see a thing . 
UNKNOWN Oh well , I'm gonna drawit on the board then . 
UNKNOWN It's in blue uh , and I couldn't change it . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN We it's fine on my screen , but never mind . 
UNKNOWN Ah . 
UNKNOWN So um the idea is that we've got the energy source um , which in our case will pr , oh well okay , never mind . 
UNKNOWN So um I think maybe uh two batteries , I dunno what they're called six , or something like that . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Uh and then um then on the uh remote control itself will have um the sender for the signal , which could be uh an infra-red signal , um which will be sent by an electronic chip . 
UNKNOWN And uh the chip will be controlled by the user interface . 
UNKNOWN So we'll hear about that later from Gabriel . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN And uh the sender will send to the telly itself an infra-red signal to tell it to switch on or switch channels . 
UNKNOWN Um and that's it really for the working design . 
CONFIRMATION Great . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Sorry the presentationwasn't very uh clear but Really ? 
UNKNOWN I prefer the pe I prefer the human touch personally . 
CONFIRMATION Cool . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um , should I erase this or Okay . 
UNKNOWN Do you wanna just give us a moment , I just wanna copythis down . 
UNKNOWN Um I dunno if you guys have got any questions for Catherine on any of this ? 
UNKNOWN Fine . 
UNKNOWN Or suggestions ? 
UNKNOWN Is a battery like the only way of No , no No I meant like No 'cause like cha 'cause always changing um um batteries can get like annoying . 
UNKNOWN Well , it's just , you don't want it plugged in really , s In indoors . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , alternate energy source , like win wind power or Bicycle power . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , you blow on it and i Yeah , it's worked for the last fifty years you know . 
UNKNOWN The battery's down and maybe , I dunno , solar charged ? 
UNKNOWN I dunno , swi I th I th I think changing your batteries once every six months is not really a pain , but Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN One question I have , and I don't know how much control we have over this is um , as far as the infra-red signal , do we have control over , you know , how far away you can be from the receiving unit , the the T_V_ , and still have it be operational ? 
UNKNOWN I mean , maybe we want one with a strong signal stream . 
UNKNOWN How far away is your television ? 
UNKNOWN It's never gonna be more than it's never gonna be , you kno unless you've got a T_V_ the size of a football pitch , it's not doesn't have to go that far , does it ? 
UNKNOWN Uh That's true . 
UNKNOWN Well , the thing is uh you you don't Well , we can make the the signal strong enough to go through walls if if you fancy it . 
UNKNOWN Doesn't have to go through a wall , because you're not gonna be looking through a wall . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but if like you're on the phone in the other room and you need turn television off or something and you don't really want to go into the put the telephone down , and go into the other room . 
UNKNOWN I didn't think about that but Why not ? 
UNKNOWN How about Bluetooth ? 
UNKNOWN Instead of using infra-red , use Bluetooth . 
UNKNOWN Isn't that a better signal ? 
UNKNOWN I just think that it's it's gonna cost more and I'm I'm not sure it's you're gonna use it . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah I d it sounds like you you w don't wanna overcomplicate things . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN You know we don't need it . 
UNKNOWN It's a fancy idea uh it's quite nice , but then I don't th I dunno , either you if you wanna watch the telly you're in the room , you are gonna But Oh , we can we can keep the idea if you i We can see at a later stage , maybe , I don't Do you need the border ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , exactly . 
UNKNOWN Basically , we're we're desi we're designing and marketing a television remote control unit . 
UNKNOWN We're not w w w w designing something that you can plug in a headset to and and you know connect to your laptop computer and stuff . 
UNKNOWN It's uh Okay . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN 'S just an idea . 
UNKNOWN Right , well done , Catherine . 
UNKNOWN Um Gab Gabriel let's uh let's hear from you on on on such things . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Uh I'm just gonna use the PowerPointuh . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Sorry . 
UNKNOWN Technical . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Adjusting . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so , while this is warming up , there it is uh . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So I'm doing the user interface design . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , and basically uh , as far as methods , I was I was looking looking at looking at uh already existing remotes , trying to find some inspiration from designsthat are already out there . 
UNKNOWN Thinking of what we can retain , what we can do away with , uh what we what we can perfect a little bit as far as design um . 
UNKNOWN we don't want to do something that's too radical of a change , I guess , I mean people want a remote that's familiar , that has their favourite functionalities um and and does the basics , but Um so we can improve what's out there and maintain that , the basic functionality that people want . 
UNKNOWN Mm yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um so things that seem like absolute must-haves uh would be a volume control , um so up-down keys for that , uh channel keys up-down , but then also a numerical key pad so that they can just key directly to the channel that they want , rather than doing up-down , and uh a mute button . 
UNKNOWN Uh one thing that I didn't include here , that I forgot that we talked about last time , was doing um some sort of lock uh function . 
UNKNOWN Uh , I don't I dunno , uh that's one possibility . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN And so in the research that I was doing there's basically two types of remotes , ones that are engineering centred and ones that are more user centred , which I don't know if I can access the web pagefrom here , but I can show you uh . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So this is a engineer centred one , so you see it's rather busy , but it also lets you play your movie , stop your movie , fast-forward , all this , um freeze frame . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Uh and this is a user centred one . 
UNKNOWN Uh it's it's easier to g just glance at this and see what's possible to do , you're not gonna be staring at it for five minutes . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Great . 
UNKNOWN And I judging from what what we all talked about during our last meeting I kind of gathered that that's what we were going after , uh or the direction we were going in at least . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN So , the engineering centred ones uh provide a lot of functionality , but it can be a little bit overwhelming , so the user centred ones just focus on ease of use . 
UNKNOWN Uh and this sort of overlaps with what the marketing person uh , Reissa , because uh we we need to find out what what people want before we make firm decisions on this . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN . 
UNKNOWN So uh , yeah , that's me . 
CONFIRMATION Great . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Now that's I just have a q a q question for you . 
UNKNOWN This w um research that you've been doing looki looking at other , you know , existing units stuff . 
UNKNOWN Um have you found that anyone else has do has looked into the locking function or Yeah . 
UNKNOWN No that that that seemed like a novel idea as f as far as I know . 
UNKNOWN I mean obviously another exists like you like you said in in mobile phones . 
UNKNOWN That was sort of the inspiration for it . 
UNKNOWN Um I've never seen that with in in all my years in in the remote business . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I've , haven't I've never seen a locking functionality . 
UNKNOWN I dunno , what uh do you guys have a a yea or nay on that a feeling about whether that's really necessary ? 
UNKNOWN Um I would say it's If it's simple to do , which I think it probably should be , even if it's a physical , you know , a f a like a f a physical switch or a physical cover for the remote , even something like that , um then yes , it's like , you know , like s you said earlier on ab ab ab a flip thing , something like that , but you know being physical . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Look into . 
UNKNOWN Um I've had word down from head office that something that we should be centred well , something we should take into account is um we've gotta keep the corporate image within this remote control unit . 
UNKNOWN It's gotta d look like it's in the R_ and R_ . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN You know , the the company it's it's , from what I can see from our other products , are yellow with blue writing on them . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN And our motto is is we put the fashion in electronics . 
UNKNOWN We put the fashion in electronics . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN I think I think we have to carry that mental . 
UNKNOWN There you go . 
UNKNOWN So it's kinda gotta look it's gotta look new and s you know something fashionable . 
UNKNOWN If if remote control well , if telephones can be fashionable , then maybe remote control units can be . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Well yeah these , I think , we can so we talked about the layoutin my presentationand what I didn't mention yet really is is the sort of like the ergonomic design . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Because we need Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I t I think we can make big improvements over these two that you see here , I mean . 
UNKNOWN Uh , everything is going t ergonomic , you know , there's you know mice for your computers that are very ergonomic and keyboards and that could be one of our niches p sort of uh uh in the market , I guess . 
CONFIRMATION Great . 
UNKNOWN Okay , fantastic . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Right , well done , Gabriel . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um Reissa . 
UNKNOWN . 
UNKNOWN Where does it go into ? 
UNKNOWN Let's plug you in , baby . 
UNKNOWN . 
UNKNOWN Here ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN The blue thing . 
UNKNOWN Uh , yeah , this is getting all . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , then you just have to do function F_ eight and it should come up . 
UNKNOWN Well , function F_ eight . 
UNKNOWN No oh . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , w it it just takes a wee while . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , it just takes a second uh . 
UNKNOWN Come on . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Well , for our marketing reportuh we observed remote control users in a usability lab , and also gave so this is research and we also gave participants um questionnaires to fill out . 
UNKNOWN Um total number of people tested were a hundred just so you know , so that hundred people were tested and these were the findings . 
UNKNOWN So seventy five per cent of users find the remote control ugly . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so they don't like the look of the remote control . 
UNKNOWN Um eighty f eighty per cent of them would spend more money if the rem remote control looked really cool and fancy . 
UNKNOWN So I think we all agree with that . 
UNKNOWN Um current remote controls do not match well with the operating behaviour of the user . 
UNKNOWN So , they don't like like the way they operate it doesn't like match how people behave . 
UNKNOWN Um per cent of the users say that they only use ten per cent of the buttons on a remote , so probably if you have like one , two , three , four , five , the whole up to z ten , they probably don't use those , they only use the up and down channel . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause we've only got five channels . 
UNKNOWN exactly . 
UNKNOWN That's another thing . 
UNKNOWN Um seventy five per cent of users say they zap . 
UNKNOWN Not quite sure what they mean , zap , goes like . 
UNKNOWN I think that's k flicking quickly between channels . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , you wanna navigate the channels quickly I guess . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Um takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote . 
UNKNOWN I think especially for uh the older generation . 
UNKNOWN I know my grandmother doesn't like mobile phones , takes ages to work how to use . 
UNKNOWN Anyway um and they also remotes often get lost in the room , so nobody can find them . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN So maybe tracking devices is a good idea . 
UNKNOWN Um personal preferences . 
UNKNOWN Wow . 
UNKNOWN You are a child of technology , aren't you ? 
UNKNOWN Um so yeah um I was thinking something easy to use , especially for older people . 
UNKNOWN Um has to look really cool , flashy groovy for people to buy it . 
UNKNOWN And it's easy to find , so I don't know whether maybe and also we asked them whether they wanted whether they'd be interested in um voice activating . 
UNKNOWN So voice activation . 
UNKNOWN So and this was what we came up with . 
UNKNOWN Then if you look fifteen to twenty five this is age , sorry , age groups . 
UNKNOWN So fifteen to twenty five said like ninety two ninety one per cent of them said yes . 
UNKNOWN So there you go , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um so basically the majority except for the forty five to fifty five year olds for some reason didn't want a voice activated one . 
UNKNOWN And neither did the older generation , but the younger generation who we are catering for , like who have most of the money nowadays , do want a voice act speech recognition in a remote . 
UNKNOWN Uh but do the younger generation have the money ? 
UNKNOWN No I would I would say the older the older people , yeah . 
UNKNOWN They they don't . 
UNKNOWN It's older generation , they're the ones that have gone out and People people from the age of thirty f there's a big drop off there . 
UNKNOWN Well the twenty five to thirty five year old , and thirty five , and the thirty five to forty five , forty five point seven per cent say no , so So they don't Well These guys are growing up . 
UNKNOWN For people up to the age of thirty five , you're kinda saying , yeah , they want it . 
UNKNOWN Um but no they're not sort of most people that have the money are people from the age of thirty five to fifty five , uh 'cause they're the ones that have been working for twenty years . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that would be my guess as well . 
UNKNOWN Um d and tha and that's a that's quite a minority there , so yeah , it's not even like fifty fifty that's th thirty five per cent . 
UNKNOWN What about just from the the prospective of our manufacturing cost ? 
UNKNOWN I mean if if it's twelve fifty per unit . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I mean , okay , there's Uh . 
UNKNOWN Voice activation might not be the best . 
UNKNOWN I would say scra I'd say scrap that straight off . 
UNKNOWN Um also with um with buttons , a thing called R_S_I_ , so wrist sense Huh ? 
UNKNOWN Repetitive strain uh rep repetitive strain injury or like from doing Mm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , repetitive strains injury , so they don't I think people who watch T_V_ maybe too often , keep changing channel hurts their wrist . 
UNKNOWN I don't think so . 
UNKNOWN Well maybe they shouldn't watch so much T_V_ then . 
UNKNOWN So y so it's so it's so you got so that's something we should have a look into then i when desi when designing the ergonomics of see have a look if um there's any w any medical background we can find out about this . 
UNKNOWN Yeah maybe not so hard . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Maybe it could be , instead of pressing button it could be just touching a Yep . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Let's jus we just want need to cover our arses so that people aren't gonna sue us in ten years' time , say your remote control gave me repetitive strain injury . 
UNKNOWN Maybe Mm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , we should probably consult with our legal department uh . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN They're having a lunch break at the moment , but yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I'll see if I can get see if I can get hold of them for the next meeting . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think we can do some really in in that department , the the ergonomic department , we can make some some really good improvements . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Maybe th the buttons not so high up so you don't have to press so much , or we just like flat buttons , something . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So that is me . 
UNKNOWN That's great , thank you very much for that , Reissa . 
UNKNOWN Um okay , so we've basically we've decide we've d we've decided that it's gonna be , you know uh , we're going for a basic television remote . 
UNKNOWN It's gotta be safe to use , it's gotta look cool . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN It's gotta be cheap . 
UNKNOWN S um . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Now going back to the uh industrial design of it , you know , we were looking at whether to use maybe infra-red or Bluetooth . 
UNKNOWN I think , we should just go with the simplest option on everything , uh and that would be infra-red , energy source , that would be batteries . 
UNKNOWN Uh mean we we can look into using the s , you know , the little tiny weeny batteries , all like special long-lasting batteries . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN But a in there's no I don't think there's any point in making a remote control unit that's gonna last for fifty years , because technology will have changed and , you know , we won't have televisions in ten years' time . 
UNKNOWN So I think we're all um pretty sussed on that . 
UNKNOWN Um anyone have any questions ? 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Everybody happy in their work ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , it seems like we're all on the pretty much on the same page. 
UNKNOWN Now this is good , we've got a good structure going on . 
UNKNOWN We all know where we're going to . 
UNKNOWN Have you been ge has have any of you lot been getting loads of crap spam on your computers ? 
UNKNOWN Oh it's probably just you , 'cause you're the project manager . 
UNKNOWN . 
UNKNOWN Well , just questionnaires . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Sell trying to sell your things . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , stuff . 
UNKNOWN Um okay . 
UNKNOWN Do oh have you guys found out if we can if we can e-mail stuff to each other ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , you can . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Do all you all know my e-mail address ? 
UNKNOWN No I don't . 
UNKNOWN I think he's participant one , aren't you ? 
UNKNOWN Well , in the project announcement , you've got the addresses , I think . 
UNKNOWN I Uh Oh , it's just participant one oh okay . 
UNKNOWN So Project Manager , it's participant one at A_M_I_ . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Can you all d e-mail me your e-mail addresses ? 
UNKNOWN Well it's just w it's just it's just par participant one , participant two . 
UNKNOWN You have them i you have them , but we'll send you an e-mail . 
UNKNOWN . 
UNKNOWN Send me , yeah yeah , okay . 
UNKNOWN You want to have friends , don't you ? 
UNKNOWN So are we headed towards like a b a big yellow and black remote as far as maybe that's our next meeting that we discuss that . 
UNKNOWN Is it yellow and black or is it yellow and blue ? 
UNKNOWN I I kind of thought it was blue writing on a yellow background , but I might be just going a bit Okay . 
UNKNOWN Well , it's like white on i white and blue on a black background with white with yellow borders . 
UNKNOWN Maybe that's like getting ahead of ourselves . 
UNKNOWN Well , maybe you can come up with a few with a couple of different ideas ? 
UNKNOWN It wouldn't be Well you could It could come But it could come in different colours and have the R_R_ colours just somewhere like just around the lock button could be the R_R_ logo or colours and If . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Can't we have different colours in the remotes , so somebody can choose different col like does it have to be of a certain ? 
UNKNOWN Well , see the thing is is we've gotta keep the company image . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN It's gotta say people have gotta look at this remote control and instantly recognise that it's a Real Reaction i product . 
UNKNOWN But if it's a R_R_ , it would be Real Reaction , like if it had a symbol on it . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN There's loads of companies that called R_R_ . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Whoa . 
UNKNOWN This is slog but this is the slogan , this is the the the the type . 
UNKNOWN And this is something that came on down from from the higher ups , so , I mean , we are sort of beholden to them . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So we have to have it one colour . 
UNKNOWN Well , not necessarily . 
UNKNOWN Not one colour , but the pattern needs to be recognisable . 
UNKNOWN But we have to incorporate it . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Not necessarily even if i it just has to ye but you have to look at the product and instantly know that it's one of our products as opposed to a Sony product or a , you know , a Panasonic product . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN It's got to so maybe , so you can have a look at our our other products and see if they all follow a s similar vein , perhaps . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Quite poss yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well this is all your department . 
UNKNOWN Mm okay . 
UNKNOWN Well , well done everybody . 
UNKNOWN . 
UNKNOWN And um , I think we uh stop for lunch now . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , pretty soon I think , I guess that's now . 
UNKNOWN Are we are we finished ahead of schedule ? 
UNKNOWN We might possibly have done . 
CONFIRMATION Cool . 
UNKNOWN Alright , see you all soon . 
UNKNOWN If we've if we've finished at five minutes before the meeting's supposed to finish , then that means we get an extra five minutes for lunch . 
UNKNOWN 'Kay uh . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , there you go . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN I just have to there's a few little bits and pieces I have to write down , but Take your headsets off , kick back , smoke 'em if you got 'em . 
UNKNOWN Oh right okay . 
UNKNOWN I cover myself up . 
UNKNOWN I feel like Madonna with one of these on . 
UNKNOWN I said I feel like Madonna with one of these on . 
UNKNOWN . 
UNKNOWN I've always wanted one of these , I really have . 
UNKNOWN Where do you buy 'em from ? 
UNKNOWN They're . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
GREETING Hello everybody . 
GREETING Hello . 
UNKNOWN Back again for another wonderful meeting . 
UNKNOWN Is uh everyone ready ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Almost . 
UNKNOWN Okay , we c we can hold on for a minute . 
UNKNOWN Oh my gosh . 
UNKNOWN I figured with the spam thing , if you can't beat it , join in . 
UNKNOWN That's the kind of spam that everybody likes to receive . 
UNKNOWN Mm 'kay . 
UNKNOWN Are you ready ? 
UNKNOWN Okay , right , well , I take it that you are all ready now . 
UNKNOWN Um alright first off we'll just uh recap from our last meeting . 
UNKNOWN Um which was we got together just to basically decide on well to talk about what it is that we were actually uh supposed to be doing , and who we all are and stuff like that , mm get bit more of an idea together of what's going on . 
UNKNOWN Um what we are gonna talk about in this meeting is um now that we know what it is that we are doing , now we know that it's a T_V_ remote and stuff and you guys have just been off doing some some uh R_ and D_ for that , that's research and development for those that haven't heard that before , see I'm learning all sorts of new technologi terms in technology today . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um yeah , we're gonna hear your uh th three little presentations, whether they be on computer or on the whiteboard or whatever you want . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Do you have any preference uh of order ? 
UNKNOWN Um I'd like to um hear o I'd like to hear who's g who's on the um from from uh Catherine actually first . 
UNKNOWN I want what I'd like to hear about is uh if we've finally decided on um what sort of energy we're gonna be using and It's just that yeah , let's let's hear from you first . 
UNKNOWN Batteries . 
UNKNOWN I think she is still finishing her . 
UNKNOWN No no no no , it's fine I'm just preparing . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Where is that thing ? 
UNKNOWN Okay , it's uh Is it like a crank thing or something . 
UNKNOWN It's here . 
UNKNOWN Oh sorry , couldn't see . 
UNKNOWN Would that work ? 
UNKNOWN Get yourself in position . 
UNKNOWN Ah . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so that's me again . 
UNKNOWN Um so um for the energy sources we can have a basic battery , a hand dynamo which is which was used uh in the fifties for torches , if you remember that kind of which wouldn't be v wouldn't be v v yeah , yeah . 
UNKNOWN I don't think any of us remember the fifties . 
UNKNOWN It wouldn't be very fancy . 
UNKNOWN You can have a kinetic provision of energy , which is used on some watches these days . 
UNKNOWN So if you have just a bit of gentle movement that it will give it the energy to work . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Or you can use solar cells , but I'm not sure about that indoors , really , but Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well , there's sometimes combinations , I mean , like calculators do combinations of battery with but also using some solar power . 
UNKNOWN Do sol solar panel things , do they have to work from the sun or can they work from a light bulb ? 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN I dunno actually . 
UNKNOWN Does anybody know ? 
UNKNOWN Uh I think , it has to be on the on the solar energy , but I don't know . 
UNKNOWN I dunno . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Think the the uh what would cost the less would be the basic battery , really . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN And uh if we want something fancier , I think the kinetic provision of energy could be nice , but I don't know if it's worth the cost . 
UNKNOWN So we've got to discuss that . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Okay , jolly good . 
UNKNOWN For the case of the remotes itself , um they can be a general case , which is just a flat one . 
UNKNOWN You can have uh a curved one or a double curved one , if you know what I mean , so You know , kind of more ergonomic , that kind of suits the palm of your hand , that kind of thing . 
UNKNOWN What's a double curved one ? 
UNKNOWN So Um then the case material itself , so it can be uh uh either plastic or latex , uh rubber , wood , or titanium . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN And th for each of them you have uh cases where for example titanium , you can't use it for if you if we're choosing a double curved case , we can't choose titanium . 
UNKNOWN And if we are choosing um solar cells then we can't choose latex for the case material , so we just have to take that into account . 
UNKNOWN But if we're choosing just the flat case then we can go for anything . 
UNKNOWN And I think we discussed earlier on the R_ S_ I_ problem thing , so we could uh Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So that might be an idea of using the rubber , but then it should , you know yeah . 
UNKNOWN Let's have a squeezable remote . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And also it doesn't break as easily maybe , I dunno So rubber would be Okay . 
UNKNOWN when a T_V_ programme's got one watching the match and your team's just lost , you can fuzz it across the room and it'll bounce off the wall back at you . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I like that idea . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN I think rubber's But after my after my fashion thing , I think you'll realise that rubber is more People . 
UNKNOWN Rubber , we're all we're all going we're all liking that idea ? 
UNKNOWN You think you can market that ? 
UNKNOWN Uh s so if d okay . 
UNKNOWN Ooh , we like rubber , ooh . 
UNKNOWN And then there are the push-buttons , so you can have basic push-buttons or a scroll-wheels , like you have on a mouse , um or you could have um L_C_D_ , which gives you a display . 
UNKNOWN Um scroll buttons , as well . 
UNKNOWN Uh-huh . 
UNKNOWN So if you use a rubber double curved case , you must use rubber push-buttons . 
UNKNOWN So if we're going for rubber then we have to decide for the case . 
UNKNOWN Um and if we choose double curved then we have to go for rubber push-buttons . 
UNKNOWN So it's a constraint . 
UNKNOWN Well , we're gonna go with I think we've decided that it's gonna be a rubber case so push buttons instead of the wheel ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but is it a double curved one or not ? 
UNKNOWN If it's not a double curved , then we've got the choice for the push-buttons , if it's a double curve , we've gotta go for rubber push-buttons . 
UNKNOWN If that makes sense . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN If it's rubber , isn't it malleable anyway , it doesn't matter if it's double I mean isn't a rubber case , mean it's completely flexed , I mean , it it flexes to whatever they want it to ? 
UNKNOWN . 
UNKNOWN Mean so what's the difference between a normal rubber case and a rubble doub double rubber double curved case ? 
UNKNOWN No , but na le you see , you've got , okay , the energy that's one thing , then you have the case is uh , whether it's flat or curved . 
UNKNOWN rubble double double . 
UNKNOWN I'll have a Big Mac , please . 
UNKNOWN And that's we don't care if it's rub rubber or not , but then we've decided that we going for rubber for the case material . 
UNKNOWN So if we've chosen rub rubber and if now we have the choice for the case whether it's flat , single curved or double curved . 
UNKNOWN And I'm just saying if it if we choose it to be double curved then we need to go I dunno why , but we need to go for uh rubber push-buttons . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So , either I dunno we just need to decide on the on the case . 
UNKNOWN Let's have rubber push buttons , hey . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Go rubber . 
UNKNOWN Go rubber the whole way . 
UNKNOWN Let's go crazy . 
UNKNOWN And then , do I have a last slide? 
UNKNOWN Yes , I do . 
UNKNOWN Um so the push-buttons themselves they can be just simple or they can be so that's just the electronics between the but behind the push-buttons . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um and the price that go with it with it , so the simple push-buttons are gonna be the cheapest . 
UNKNOWN Uh if we get a scroll-wheel , that's a higher price range . 
UNKNOWN If we get an advanced chip which is um used for the L_C_D_ , the display thing , then that's even more expensive . 
UNKNOWN Simple , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Chip on print. 
UNKNOWN It's a bit . 
UNKNOWN Okay , uh what I'm not understanding here is uh , okay , advanced chip on print, which I presume is like one P_C_B_ and that's got all the electronics on one board including the um infra-red sender ? 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN The infra-red . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Um what a what alternatives do we have to that ? 
UNKNOWN Y um what alternatives do we have to the chip on print? 
UNKNOWN Well , if if it's not chip on printthen , I guess , you get different chip components , and you build them separately and doesn't include the infra-red . 
UNKNOWN It's less expensive mm Technically speaking , it's not as advanced , but it does the job , too . 
UNKNOWN so it sounds So , why would we not go for that ? 
UNKNOWN If it's something that's inside the the unit . 
UNKNOWN Fo It doesn't , yeah , yeah , yeah . 
UNKNOWN I it doesn't affects whether the customer's gonna buy it or not . 
UNKNOWN Totally . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um we wanna go for an i i all so long as it works , you know . 
UNKNOWN So let's not go for the Yeah , yeah . 
UNKNOWN I agree . 
UNKNOWN So let's not let's uh not bother with the chip on print. 
UNKNOWN So it's either um the scroll-wheel or the push-buttons . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN S yeah , push buttons . 
UNKNOWN What about the just developed uh sample sensor ? 
UNKNOWN I think push-buttons is Yeah . 
UNKNOWN What about what ? 
UNKNOWN G there , the sample sensor , sample speaker thing . 
UNKNOWN Well It'd be it'd be cool , but they are saying they've just developed it , I'm just guessing . 
UNKNOWN Well , what do we need a speaker for in a remote control unit ? 
UNKNOWN Mm , I dunno . 
UNKNOWN Be cool . 
UNKNOWN Channel two . 
UNKNOWN But it's gonna be the most expensive option , probably and Hm . 
UNKNOWN S Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Th the the speech recognition um option is it doesn't seem really very promising for us uh , 'cause uh The yeah the example that they're already using it for is with the coffee machine , where , basically , you can program a sample wi um That when you say something it will give a response , and you program the response as well . 
UNKNOWN It's not something that we wanna t go into with this product . 
UNKNOWN Just uh clips of tha that you record yourself . 
UNKNOWN So you can program your coffee-maker that when you say , good morning , to it it says , hello Rick , or whatever . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But , I mean , it's not it would be one thing if it was speech recognition where you say something and it turns the T_V_ on like , turn the T_V_ on , and i turns comes on , but it's not that . 
UNKNOWN It just gives you a it just gives you a verbal response . 
UNKNOWN Oh , it just gives an answer . 
UNKNOWN So , yeah , I mean , like what's the point of saying , Hello remote , I mean , hello , how how are you ? 
UNKNOWN Oh , then then I thought I thought it was when they said I thought when they said , voice recognition , they meant um like , channel five , and it will change . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Just if you are really lonely , maybe . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , if you're really lonely , it is it's No , tha that w that w that would be more promising . 
UNKNOWN Channel five . 
UNKNOWN And then it switches on . 
UNKNOWN Like you talk to it . 
UNKNOWN Can I have channel five ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It it's just a remote that talks to you . 
CONFUSION Uh . 
UNKNOWN Oh , then forget about it . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Oh right okay . 
UNKNOWN I mean to certain cues . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so I'll go back , maybe , to the previous slideand we can decide for each problem , what we should choose . 
UNKNOWN So for the energy source , do we go for the battery or the Cheaper option . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I'm fine with the basic battery . 
UNKNOWN Basic battery . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN It's cheap , it's cheerful , it's worked , does work . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Are you happy with that ? 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So we'll go for the battery . 
UNKNOWN Then the case , do you want it flat or curved or sing or double curved ? 
UNKNOWN We were go we were going with the late with the the R_S_I_ rubber , weren't we ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , so we want it rub rubber double curved . 
UNKNOWN The the The double whopper , please . 
UNKNOWN So it will look like something like this . 
UNKNOWN Double ? 
UNKNOWN Okay , so then if we use double curved case , then we have to u choose rubber push-buttons , and that's fine ? 
UNKNOWN Yep , but we're going for the simple buttons . 
UNKNOWN So rubber rubber keys , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And it's cheapest all round , it sounds kinda funky , and we can also market it as i 'cause we were s saying earl you were saying earlier in your research that um the the people have the R_ people were getting the complaining about R_S_I_ , and this is anti-R_S_I_ . 
UNKNOWN P Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So that's another marketing point that we can use . 
UNKNOWN Well the rubber push-buttons . 
UNKNOWN Don't you have to move your Mm . 
UNKNOWN But anything is gonna have buttons . 
UNKNOWN Even if it's a jog wheel , it's still repetitive . 
UNKNOWN I thought they would give an option of flat buttons or a That they don't . 
UNKNOWN You You see , you can still get it does you still get repetitive strain injury , whether you are pressing a button or pressing a flat bit of screen . 
UNKNOWN It's the v it's the fact that you are pressing the same doing the same movement . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN . 
UNKNOWN It's not actually what you are doing . 
UNKNOWN But the fact that this this rubber i is actually used in these anti-R_S_I_ ps specific Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , the rubber's good . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN We're giving them a way to burn off steam , basically , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , so they can sit there and go like Mm . 
UNKNOWN Not that watching T_V_ should be that stressful . 
UNKNOWN And you know , yeah , you can fuzz it across the room and throw it at throw it at your children yeah . 
UNKNOWN Oh yeah , I guess T_V_ can be stressful , yeah , if you're watching sports . 
UNKNOWN Alright , that's me done . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
UNKNOWN Okay , Gabriel . 
UNKNOWN Let's um let's let's hear from you about the um it's the interface . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , some of what I have to say ties into what Catherine was just talking about . 
CONFIRMATION Great . 
UNKNOWN Sorry . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so I'm continuing with the user interface uh topic . 
UNKNOWN And so basically I consulted with our manufacturing division . 
UNKNOWN It sounded like Catherine was also speaking with them . 
UNKNOWN Uh I also took uh Reissa's marketing findings from the last meeting into consideration um , 'cause I think that's that's crucial as far as uh what keys we're going to inc inclu what buttons we are going to include and and how they're laid out . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Uh and so the manufacturing division uh sent some some samples of of uh interface components that we might be interested in using that have been used in other products , uh like the coffee machine . 
UNKNOWN So I already mentioned the speech recognition interface . 
UNKNOWN I guess , we we basically vetoed that idea . 
UNKNOWN It's it's pointless . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Uh it's just a sample sensor sample output . 
UNKNOWN It would just be probably the most expensive part of our remote without any actual interesting functionality as far as operating the T_V_ . 
UNKNOWN Uh so yeah , they they also give the uh they they suggested the idea of using a spinning wheel like you use on the side of an M_P_ three player like iPod . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Um so we've already addressed that and I think that would actually be worse for something like R_S_I_ I mean you got that thumb movement that you're constantly doing . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN That does get annoying . 
UNKNOWN Um the other suggestion , and I I have a feeling that we're interested in in something more general , but they suggested uh , you know , going i a little bit into a a niche , like either gearing our remote towards kids , where you could have lot of colours um , the keys might be you know , funny or or , or uh something for the elderly , where the remote's very large and the buttons are very large and there's only a few buttons . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN But you know we can we can discuss this , but it sounded like from our last meeting we really wanted something that was general , but done well . 
UNKNOWN Uh um So , the key layoutand design are really crucial . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN You don't want uh you want people to be able to quickly access the buttons that they use a lot without uh always pressing the wrong one um . 
UNKNOWN And I didn't mention that we need a power button in our last I can give you an example here of uh , good layoutand bad layoutuh from our manufacturing department . 
UNKNOWN So this would be an example of bad layout, where you have volume up and volume down , but they have a V_ on both of them , so uh it's sort of confusing for the user . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh this is the example of the giant remote that's impossible to lose . 
UNKNOWN Do we have an uh example of a good one ? 
UNKNOWN Uh-huh . 
UNKNOWN Brilliant . 
UNKNOWN Well Maybe we can Right . 
UNKNOWN And for something for kids . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Um . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And so , yeah , I th I think my personal preferences of we've all kind of talked about and seemed to be on the same pageum . 
UNKNOWN Uh so I was against the speech recognition and against going uh towards anything in in a niche sense . 
UNKNOWN I think it should be more general . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN I didn't I didn't think the spinning-wheel or the uh L_C_ display were were crucial for us . 
UNKNOWN And , yeah , that's it for me . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Well let's um so w what are our definite decisions on this then as a team ? 
UNKNOWN The um The the um the interface type we're going for Just the simple s simple straight set of buttons . 
UNKNOWN So we're we're not gonna have any sort of display I think uh . 
UNKNOWN So , yeah , it's just gonna be just gonna be push-buttons . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN I think we shall have a limited number of buttons , ideally , I mean a a power , channel up , channel down , volume up , volume down , and a numerical keypad . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Uh . 
UNKNOWN And some sort of it will either have a a lock button like we mentioned or or a cover or something like that . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I guess it's to the point where we need to decide about that . 
UNKNOWN Okay , and we're not yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well now that we've decided on our Um it seems like we wouldn't wanna make it too busy and too sort of gaudy , but um Yeah , I would say mayb maybe a couple of colours like uh like a black with with yellow and somewhere , like maybe the R_R_ can be yellow , or something like that . 
UNKNOWN Are we gonna hav hav an are we d have we decided on whether w we're gonna s supplement it with anything , you know , colours or particular gimmicky bits to it , we're not we're just gonna go for something We're Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Okey-dokey . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I don't have any other questions on this . 
UNKNOWN Let's move over to Yeah , sure . 
UNKNOWN I I guess the fact uh also that we are having a rubber case uh would prevent us from having the cover function that we thought of before . 
UNKNOWN I mean , 'cause uh s so if we wanna have a lock of some sort it would have to be a button . 
UNKNOWN . 
UNKNOWN But I think that should be I mean um , I can speak with the button department , but uh I think that it should be easy to have a button that just prevents prevents the other uh the other buttons from operating . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , the button that just does that , yeah . 
UNKNOWN So that should be simple . 
CONFIRMATION Cool . 
UNKNOWN Well , I'm just basically letting you know what's happening in the markets and what the fashions are for next year . 
UNKNOWN Mm yeah . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN So yes , so from looking at this year's trends and fashions and also recent investigation that we've done in the remote control market , we have found that for the remote control market these are like most important aspects like that we really need to which we've already probably discussed . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um the most important aspect is look and feel . 
UNKNOWN So the remote control has to look and feel fancier than the ones that already that we already have . 
UNKNOWN So it has to be Yep . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , why should people buy this when they're already got a remote that came with the T_V_ ? 
UNKNOWN Exactly . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um second , uh it should be technologically innovative innovative . 
UNKNOWN So Technologically it should be like um work , basically , I guess . 
UNKNOWN What's that mean ? 
UNKNOWN It should work . 
UNKNOWN Well it should be it should be maybe cutting edge in some sense , I mean have something that's little more technologically advanced than what's on the market . 
UNKNOWN Should That's new . 
UNKNOWN Okay , now the trouble is is we've already decided that we're going with the stuff that works already , that's cheap . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Actually , I mean , these first two points we've already sort of gone away from , 'cause our rubber one is not fancy I mean it's different , but I wouldn't say like a rubber remote is fancy . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN If that's what people want then we maybe we're going in the wrong direction . 
UNKNOWN And it's it's not technologically innovative either . 
UNKNOWN So , no loose That's why I was thinking , Bluetooth , 'cause if you like put up Bluetooth , and it's like a Bluetooth remote control , everybody's gonna like , oh , 'cause Bluetooth is the in thing nowadays , like it really is , like people and um when it comes to marketing like that's what people go for , they don't really care whether , you know , at the end of the day whether it works properly or not . 
UNKNOWN Maybe we could um Of course , they do . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Well , they do , but it's like it's not Yeah , but it looks good . 
UNKNOWN One hundred per cent , that's your first thing , you go , oh I'm not gonna buy that , 'cause I dunno if it works or not . 
UNKNOWN If it looks good and it's it can just be there for decoration . 
UNKNOWN Okay , well , what do you two think about this ? 
UNKNOWN So is is the advantage of Bluetooth that you can just like synchronise it with other electronics ? 
UNKNOWN But like You could always insert , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , what I don't understand what m Yeah , and it this is just gonna all this is being used for is your television . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's basically what it allows you to do , right ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but , I mean , people like Well , if you're looking at if you looking at something that's going to be bought by people , you have to make it new , you have to make it state of the art . 
UNKNOWN It would that would mean you'd need a television that has Bluetooth in it , which no no television does , does it ? 
UNKNOWN Well Bluetooth would , for example , enable you , I think , to um um connect for example you if you get a w call on your mobile phone , but your mobile phone is downstairs or something , you would get on your television you're being called by this person right now . 
UNKNOWN That would mean we'd have to make a television as well . 
UNKNOWN Things like that . 
UNKNOWN No , that would be your telephone in with your television . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , the that wouldn't be the remote so much , I mean Mm . 
UNKNOWN No i No , but if you get Bluetooth on the remote , you'd be able to I with the television , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , and i Nah , the televi the television would have to be a Bluetooth compatible , basically . 
UNKNOWN I was just trying to find an advantage . 
UNKNOWN Wha what w what advantage would you get for the Maybe the kinetic mo provision of energy then . 
UNKNOWN Well , it doesn't Like it doesn't have to be , you know , Bluetooth , that was just an idea , but like it needs do something that , you know , is new . 
UNKNOWN An and there is no there is no such thing . 
UNKNOWN Whether it's a battery it could be something really really minor , you know , like but I think we are really keeping to what is already out there , and people've already seen it , people've already got it . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN If we want something new , we need to move away from what we already have and um just go creative . 
UNKNOWN It's been done for watches , but I haven't seen that for remotes , yet . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , this that's that's very good . 
UNKNOWN And then you can market it . 
UNKNOWN Never have to change a battery again . 
UNKNOWN Change the batteries ever again . 
UNKNOWN And and this is all tying in very nicely . 
UNKNOWN The fact that it's made out of this rubber , we can throw it about . 
UNKNOWN Th we should encourage people to throw their remote controls about , because it charges itself up by doing it . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , well , and in little characters you say , yeah , but not too much . 
UNKNOWN Yes , so can Yeah , we can make the squeezing of the rubber be the be the generating like the energy generator . 
UNKNOWN I think , safety s Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But yeah , by the squeezing it the Yeah , that's a great idea . 
UNKNOWN Well done . 
UNKNOWN Third most important aspect uh is it's easy to use . 
UNKNOWN And I think we've all um worked that out . 
UNKNOWN we're all about that . 
UNKNOWN Um okay , in the fashion , how it's supposed to look . 
UNKNOWN Next year's fashion i very much in fruit and vegetables are thm are like the theme for cloths , shoes and furniture . 
UNKNOWN So next year people will be buying , I found this really funny , you know , strawberry shaped chairs , and things . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so we could have keys that are like a b like a broccoli key and a uh and an avocado key on them . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Rubber things . 
UNKNOWN I wanna watch the pineapple channel . 
UNKNOWN Um and as it's rubber the feel which is in this year is spongy , so it's it's not quite spongy , but spongy , I would say is yeah , so we're in . 
UNKNOWN . 
UNKNOWN Well spongy , that's where . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , we're we're ahead of the game there . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's great for us . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And so personal what I was just saying like move away from the current remote controls uh like the look and the feel of the current ones and change the look and feel , while still keeping to the company's image , basically . 
UNKNOWN So yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN . 
UNKNOWN I had to say So we're moving in the right direction like Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Alright , yeah , no , this i this is good , so through all that we've we go we're right , we're gonna go go back to um going with the kinetic thing , that's great , using the spongy rubber that we were talking about that anti-R_S_I_ you can as you squeeze it you are not only therapeuticising yourself , you are charging the batteries , and um I'm not sure about the buttons being in the shape of fruit though . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's great . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I don't know how we incorporate We don't have to follow every trend , I guess . 
UNKNOWN No vegetables . 
UNKNOWN . 
UNKNOWN Maybe make it like fruity colours or something . 
UNKNOWN Some sort . 
UNKNOWN Uh-huh . 
UNKNOWN Or Mm . 
UNKNOWN The power button could be like a big apple or something . 
UNKNOWN Well yeah , but Apple would sue you for that . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , this is true . 
UNKNOWN They don they don't own all images of apples . 
UNKNOWN sued the Beatles so Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay , we'll make it a uh pomegranate , a big pomegranate . 
UNKNOWN Well , okay , it seems like the only thing that we haven't really finally um agreed on is its image . 
UNKNOWN Like , yeah , we're we're saying no we don't want it to be fruit and vegetables , but we dunno what it should be , or like are we going yeah it looks slick , but what do what do we mean by slick sort of thing ? 
UNKNOWN . 
UNKNOWN Well I think , if it's rubber it needs to be different . 
UNKNOWN I mean you said earlier on i it should be funky . 
UNKNOWN I think , it's it should be I mean , what do you associate with rubber ? 
UNKNOWN You know like really different colours basically . 
UNKNOWN L keep it clean , keep it clean . 
UNKNOWN Okay , sor I sorry , I used the wrong word , what do you associate with the mate the material that material ? 
UNKNOWN Um Um like I'm just thinking bright colours . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Bright natural colours , nothing too Bright , but too not yeah . 
UNKNOWN Bright , but not too bright . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Like no lime green or bright yellow or bright pink . 
UNKNOWN Wanna make it different colours so anybody can choo like like Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Like the volume buttons should be the all the same colour and the d and the the channel buttons should be one colour and stuff like that , do you mean ? 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN And on the back of it have the logo . 
UNKNOWN Okay , what ? 
CONFIRMATION Sure . 
UNKNOWN Why not ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN The one thing I'm wondering about , I hope that we're not going like too much down a gimmicky road of of having I mean if somebody go goes into the store they're gonna see like three or four normal remotes , and then a big spongy pink t tomato uh remote . 
UNKNOWN Tha Yeah , I mean we that's we we Yeah . 
UNKNOWN This is the remote control tomato . 
UNKNOWN I mean what are ninety per cent of people gonna take ? 
UNKNOWN Well I can say in this country , you'll get , you know , lots of people wanting something really funky and cool . 
UNKNOWN Like and kids will be walking in with their parents saying , Mummy I wanna buy that one . 
UNKNOWN And uh parents will see the will see the pro as well , because it's um like kids won't break it , it's not breakable if you throw it around . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Especially with younger kids , you know they can pick it up and and Yeah . 
UNKNOWN The only thing is is that really small kids might chew on it , but Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well , it's it's gotta be chew proof . 
UNKNOWN So so it's rea it's quite it's quite like um user friendly and also for different families , like like family use as well , so for little kids and for old ki like teenagers will like it , I think . 
UNKNOWN I'm gonna write that down . 
UNKNOWN Especially maybe younger girls if it's in pink they'll be like pink remote control for their room something . 
UNKNOWN So , what are you saying , maybe we should market it in different colours for different so we could do like the pink range , the blue range , the green range , the Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN That's yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN So like you walk in , you're like , oh I like that remote control , because it's so bright , and then , and then the shop assistant comes up and says , oh what colour would you like ? 
UNKNOWN and then they go like , oh I can choose the colour wow . 
UNKNOWN So it puts , I think , even the customer into more control over what they're buying instead of , you've got all colour it's either that or nothing . 
UNKNOWN So they also get to pick . 
UNKNOWN Well , personally I like walking into a shop and choosing a colour . 
UNKNOWN Yeah I mean , that that seems to work well with for products like iPod , where , you know , you have a variety of colours , that people feel like they're customising it when they buy it , even , you know , just just by the fact of choosing . 
UNKNOWN It's um Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN D you've got the Evaluation . 
UNKNOWN Although I'd be curious to see how many uh You know , there are some colours that I wouldn I would never choose , and I would be curious how many people choose that colour . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Well that's that can be down to bit of market researching you know , if that's easy enough to find out what colours are more popular . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And produce less of the silly colours , maybe . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
UNKNOWN Well um , we'll alright let's what we're gonna aim to get together by the next meeting then um is from you Catherine wi your y y you know you're gonna be working on the the look and feel design . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN Um Gabriel , you're gonna be working on , you know come up with the the user interface design . 
UNKNOWN Then basically , you two are gonna be working together on this . 
UNKNOWN You won't be going off to your separate offices . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um and I think you are gonna get a chance to play with some clay . 
UNKNOWN Oh right . 
UNKNOWN I think , yeah , it's gonna you know , come up ki you know , be ab for the next meeting be able to come in and show us some some i some physical ideas . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause at the moment , uh you know , it's it's hard . 
CONFIRMATION Cool . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN We were kinda going , yeah , it's gotta feel nice , it's gotta look cool and that it's you know now we can actually start , you know , s some sort of physical something or other . 
UNKNOWN It is . 
UNKNOWN That sounds good . 
UNKNOWN Um and you're gonna be working on the product evaluation . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN And I will be uh talking to the bosses , basically , and uh f fielding off some more spam and uh that's it really . 
CONFIRMATION Great . 
UNKNOWN Keeping things t well , uh you know , ho hopefully uh keeping things together . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's This is this is uh good . 
UNKNOWN So we know for definite we know we've we've now got some definite things going on . 
UNKNOWN We definitely know how it's powered , we definitely know that um it's gonna be a simple buttons , we're not gonna be going for the new technological chip on printexpensive things , so we've we're keeping the costs down . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN It's this rubber casing that we can sell as um fun and funky . 
UNKNOWN Don't know of any other remote controls that are made out of this stuff . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN People , you know , people are saying , oh , standard stuff gives you repetitive strain injury , well this remote control is designed to do the complete opposite , It's supposed to fix it rather than cause it . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN you know , we're gonna we we're gonna as a sort of extra something on it , you know what what extra things are there extra things this product have ? 
UNKNOWN We'll look into this lock key facility , although whether or not it happens , or is possible , I don't know , but something to look into . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN I think that's um well done everybody . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
UNKNOWN Anyone have any uh any questions , everyone know what they're doing ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause if you don't , you'll I'm sure you'll soon get an e-mail about it . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Mm , I think we all know what we need to do now . 
UNKNOWN S This gives you all the details ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN right well . 
UNKNOWN It's um we're we've still couple of minutes until our meeting's due to finish . 
UNKNOWN But um I got a note saying that you two who are gonna be working together so bef before you all disappear off just hold hold fire . 
UNKNOWN Okay , I'll stay in here . 
CONFUSION Um . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Does the pay-raise immediately come into effect on our next pay-check , or is that So we're buying fut I mean , we're getting futures in the company . 
UNKNOWN Um I think , it's uh , yeah , I think , it's gonna be par part more of a profit sharing on the product . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I think i I think that's I think that's the way it's gonna happen at the moment . 
UNKNOWN So we really have a incentive to make this remote work . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I'd like to share in the coffee machine profits , because that's really doing well . 
UNKNOWN I want a share in the space rocket . 
UNKNOWN Did you see that this k that this company we've made a spaceship . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN This company has its its fingers in a lot of different pots . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , we're definitely not in the money making department . 
UNKNOWN . 
UNKNOWN Well I I did notice looking at I mean , they told you that they wanted whatev our product to represent the the R_R_ brand and and to be immediately noticeable . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I mean , if you look like at the coffee maker at the at the corporate web page, it's not obvious . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN R_R_ . 
UNKNOWN Well it is to us , because we we worked worked here for years and we use that coffee machine , but it's doesn't have the colour scheme of of the of the company anywhere on it obviously it's just sil silver and black . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN That's true . 
UNKNOWN And the spaceship doesn't have the R_ have a massive R_ and R_ down the side of it but I still want one . 
NEGATION No . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Doesn't Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um I've just had a sign flashing up saying , finish the meeting . 
CONFUSION Uh . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Right , well , I guess that's us . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It's not telling it's not saying do anything in particular just yet . 
UNKNOWN So maybe you should go back to your own offices . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Are we taking these off ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , it says you two . 
UNKNOWN It's Play-Doh . 
UNKNOWN Play-Doh's edible . 
UNKNOWN Did you know that ? 
UNKNOWN It's definitely Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Because kids yeah . 
UNKNOWN I used to eat it . 
UNKNOWN I've , I've definitely eaten it before . 
UNKNOWN I didn't know was edible . 
UNKNOWN But um , it's it's made edible 'cause , yeah . 
UNKNOWN It's it's chew proof . 
UNKNOWN . 
UNKNOWN It's made edible 'cause kids eat it , and if it's wasn't edible then Well , normal babies . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Actually that makes sense , because I remember like , peopl I dunno if my Mom ever did it but I remember other people's Moms making like home-made Play-Doh where you just like make the colouring and make some sort of sort of dough . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Oh yeah it is , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Oh yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Everybody everybody ready ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN Okay , let's have your um let's get have the uh presentation? 
UNKNOWN We've got some . 
UNKNOWN We've got a cool prototype . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , it's pretty exciting . 
UNKNOWN So , everything uh that we wanted we wanted it to be ergonomic and to be made out of rubber , very simple and easy to use , yeah , double curved , um but also something that was gonna jump out at people , something that would be different uh , separate it from the other remotes out on the market . 
UNKNOWN Double curved . 
UNKNOWN Nice . 
UNKNOWN So uh I think if you put this in the palm of your hand , you'll see what a nice thing we have going here . 
UNKNOWN That is cool . 
UNKNOWN So , basically , if you hold it like that , the one on your thumb , yeah , the thumb button is the power button . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Your index finger is channel up , middle finger is channel down , ring finger is volume up , your pinkie is volume down . 
UNKNOWN What's the big blue thing ? 
UNKNOWN That's the lock button , has a L_ L_ on it and then the M_ is a mute button . 
UNKNOWN Oh cool . 
UNKNOWN And then it also has digit For muting the uh Um and then then you can also there's a numeric keypad on the top so you can key directly to the to the channel if you want . 
UNKNOWN what button ? 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN And mute . 
UNKNOWN Oh mute . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So it's really basic functionalities as far as what keys are available , but we think it's very comfortable and very innovative and it looks different . 
UNKNOWN That certainly does . 
UNKNOWN So all the , I mean the important keys are right at your f f you know right at uh at a convenient place for you to to access them . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN So you don't you Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Which is ant anti-R_S_I_ . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN It should be . 
UNKNOWN And it's also conformable to the size of your hand . 
UNKNOWN I mean if that's too big , it's a rubber remote , so you can , you know change that . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN 'S great . 
UNKNOWN Oh it's so cute . 
UNKNOWN So d does that uh what mesh with what you guys were hoping and for and expecting or does it Ah , that's good thinking , yeah . 
UNKNOWN I have one thing about it , but it's a small thing , but it'd mean we'd have to make a right-handed one and a left-handed one . 
UNKNOWN Oh right , yeah . 
UNKNOWN But , that's I don't see why that's not possible . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , if we build rocket ships why can't we build left-handed and right-handed uh remotes . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN They make left-handed scissors , you know . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but then but then you can learn to use your right h like I was just thinking if there's left-handers and right-handers in the family , what , they have two remotes ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I didn't I didn't think about that , but I'd yeah , . 
UNKNOWN Yes s Mm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I know I know people who have left-handed and right-handed people in the family and they all use the computer for the whole the same computer the fes family and they have a mouse , and everybody is using right-handed mouse . 
CONFIRMATION Sure . 
CONFIRMATION Sure . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I'm sure they'll be able to I mean it's only pressing buttons , you don't have to do anything , you know , extraordinary . 
UNKNOWN Uh-huh . 
UNKNOWN I think everybody can press a button with their left and right hand so Yeah , it's not Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Imagine d are you right handed ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Imagine you're doing it with your left hand , I don't think it's too But we can have both uh Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Have them in stock . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Make 'em more appealing as well . 
UNKNOWN But um other than that , I mean uh and that's um , you know , that's just something , I think I think it's great , yeah , great idea . 
UNKNOWN Do you think it says R_R_ ? 
UNKNOWN I think it does . 
UNKNOWN I think it's , well , if the R_R_ motto is , we bring fashion to to electronics , I'd say that could be quite fashionable . 
UNKNOWN Fashion to electronics . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And it's got the b the black and yellow and blue . 
UNKNOWN Plus red , which is sort of a a fruit and vegetable uh uh . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN There you go . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN . 
UNKNOWN So that's that's our end of things wha uh That's Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , very good , yeah . 
UNKNOWN It's come up with what we've you know , the things that's what we've what we were looking at doing , hasn't it , all seems to be there . 
UNKNOWN Well done . 
UNKNOWN And all the playing around is uh Yeah , I'm just do you wanna plug in ? 
UNKNOWN Um before we move on I need that cable . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
THANKS Thank you . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN One thing I do need to do we need to look at , is the costs . 
UNKNOWN The costs , was that what you said ? 
UNKNOWN Play-Doh is very cheap . 
UNKNOWN Well , yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Play-Doh won't last very long everybody'll go like , oops , it's gone . 
UNKNOWN um Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But it's edible . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Chew proof . 
UNKNOWN Well , they'll buy more of them if you eat them , . 
UNKNOWN That was the main criteria from the last meeting , it had to be chew proof . 
UNKNOWN Uh right . 
UNKNOWN Okay , now I think we'll do this I could do you know , I can do this o on my own or I could do it with you , but it's just easy enough to go through it with you , so we're going for the kinetic power . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Oh ho-ho . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN And the electronics , we decided on it being just a simple , the easiest thing that's inside it . 
UNKNOWN Ooh . 
UNKNOWN So the case , we've gone for the double curved . 
UNKNOWN Um and it's made out of rubber . 
UNKNOWN The interface is push-buttons . 
UNKNOWN And button supplements well they're in diff special colours , aren't they ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So special colours . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It's better for And special material . 
UNKNOWN Special form , yeah , they're a special form there in shapes and stuff . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I mean , these these ones on the side are curved kind of , so The buttons are rubber . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Are they made out of any special material ? 
UNKNOWN Rubber . 
UNKNOWN No they're not . 
UNKNOWN They're not made out of wood or titanium or rubber or anything , they're just simple Okay . 
UNKNOWN Well they're rubber , aren't they ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN So let's see if that comes within budget . 
UNKNOWN And it does . 
UNKNOWN That is gonna cost uh Yeah . 
UNKNOWN We're under budget . 
UNKNOWN . 
UNKNOWN That's gonna cost ten ten Euro seventy cents a unit to make . 
UNKNOWN And our target was it had to come in at under twelve fifty . 
UNKNOWN That's cool . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So , this is all very very good . 
UNKNOWN And we're actua actually making a better profit than we expected . 
UNKNOWN The bosses will be very pleased . 
UNKNOWN Okay , let's just save this so I can e-mail it to you . 
CONFUSION Uh . 
UNKNOWN Save it in save it in the uh my documents. 
UNKNOWN It's already saved , I think . 
UNKNOWN Splendid . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So uh , that's done with this with this um doodah , so you're . 
UNKNOWN Gonna do what you were gonna do , your evaluation . 
THANKS Thank you . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Oh , yeah . 
UNKNOWN This is where we all get to I get to write on the , oops , on the board . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN 'S function Okay . 
UNKNOWN F_ eight . 
UNKNOWN I love the smell of that Play-Doh . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , have some have some . 
UNKNOWN I cou . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So , evaluation . 
UNKNOWN We're gonna do it all together so we evaluate each criteria . 
UNKNOWN I've got the criterias . 
UNKNOWN And we have to do it on a scale of one to seven , one being true , so it's it's more like it's fits the criteria , and seven being as in it doesn't fit the criteria . 
UNKNOWN And the criterias are , and I'll drawthis up on the board so we have a box . 
UNKNOWN And this is false , this is just like to keep you informed . 
UNKNOWN So seven's here and one's here and then you've got in the middle . 
UNKNOWN So the first criteria . 
UNKNOWN Do you all get what we're doing ? 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay , cool . 
UNKNOWN Okay , first criteria , look and feel . 
UNKNOWN So the does remote look and feel fashionable to what we talked about ? 
UNKNOWN As it is it colour-wise and is it spongy ? 
UNKNOWN So what mark should we give for that ? 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN I would give it a seven . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN As in it's not . 
UNKNOWN Oh , sorry , one . 
UNKNOWN Oh sorry , one , d yeah . 
UNKNOWN A one . 
UNKNOWN A one a one . 
UNKNOWN So I'll just write criteria criteria one we get one . 
UNKNOWN Second criteria , new technology . 
UNKNOWN Have we implemented new technology ? 
UNKNOWN As in the new high-tech So it's . 
UNKNOWN Well , the kinetic thing , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN That was our main technological innovation w every everything else was fairly simple , but the fact that we used the kinetic energy was new . 
UNKNOWN . 
UNKNOWN So we'll give it a Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well so the um Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It's ergonomic , but that's not that's that's a design that's a des that's a design thing , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but that's not a technological thing , that's another thing , i that's another marketing thing . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN True . 
UNKNOWN So on the technical side of it it Easy to use . 
UNKNOWN I'd say it's about a a twoish ? 
UNKNOWN It's about in the mid in the middle somewhere , maybe , yeah , I dunno . 
UNKNOWN Two . 
UNKNOWN Two . 
UNKNOWN Three . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Maybe three , yeah . 
UNKNOWN three . 
UNKNOWN So criteria three is is it easy to use ? 
UNKNOWN I think it's a one , I think . 
UNKNOWN I'd say it's I wouldn't not if you're left-handed it's not . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I would give it a I would give it a two , 'cause i i it i it i it is more geared for right-handed people than left-handed people , but Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Two , so it's But if we make a right-handed and a left-handed then ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN If we're gonna have one left-handed and one right-handed then I would give it a one , but otherwise otherwise a two . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Give it a t give it a two . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , okay . 
UNKNOWN 'Kay , criteria four is costs . 
UNKNOWN Cost . 
UNKNOWN It's come in under budget . 
UNKNOWN 's great . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So that's a definite one . 
UNKNOWN That was great . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Amount of buttons . 
UNKNOWN Like the amount of buttons , 'cause people like a lot le like So it's a one ? 
UNKNOWN Contains only the necessary buttons . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um criteria six . 
UNKNOWN R_S_I_ is it good against ? 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN Yes s yeah . 
UNKNOWN So it's anti-R_S_I_ . 
CONFIRMATION Very good . 
UNKNOWN It's one . 
UNKNOWN And criteria seven , which is the last one , does it get lost ? 
UNKNOWN Is it easy to get lost ? 
UNKNOWN It's yellow . 
UNKNOWN I don't think it's gonna get lost easily . 
UNKNOWN It is very bright , yeah . 
UNKNOWN No ? 
UNKNOWN But it is smallish . 
UNKNOWN It's not the kinda thing that's gonna slip like between a couch cushion or something , you know . 
UNKNOWN Two . 
UNKNOWN Maybe it will . 
CONFUSION Uh . 
UNKNOWN T Mm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN I think i it would , could be , could get lost . 
UNKNOWN You think it could lost Mm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN two . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I mean it's not fully it's not fully like you can't say I mean , it's not a one , definitely . 
UNKNOWN I mean it No , I mean I mean , you could still flush it down the toilet theoretically , but Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , anything , I mean . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN It's bigger than the average mobile , I guess . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But , yeah , it can get lost . 
UNKNOWN The mobiles get lost all the time . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay , yeah , two is fine . 
UNKNOWN But then you ring 'em and you find them . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN So Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So , that's that . 
UNKNOWN So that's the evaluation , so I'd say Yay . 
UNKNOWN Alright it's all all systems go . 
UNKNOWN It's like like a number one . 
UNKNOWN We've , we've done well . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Number one product . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN All done , thanks . 
UNKNOWN We can't fail . 
UNKNOWN We fitted all the criterias . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , so So that's that one . 
UNKNOWN . 
UNKNOWN Well done , Reissa . 
UNKNOWN Okay , I I think um I just wanna put in as Project Manager the you know , little bit of praise for everybody here for how they've worked on it , you know , both individually and as a team . 
UNKNOWN You know you've w everyone's come up with their own individual ideas in their own different departments , um and then come together and worked in , you know , integrally , you know , at the right times , psp , you know , especially you two . 
UNKNOWN That's all , you know , gone very very well and and and be you know , has been good communication going on . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , during our design I mean there was some s some heated heated discussion , but we we kept we tried to keep it cool and and just just We just had to we just had to squeeze our product a little bit and Now you guys have been a a great team . 
UNKNOWN Did you have to go down to the the corporate squash court and bash a few balls about ? 
UNKNOWN Well . 
UNKNOWN You know It is . 
UNKNOWN Fantastic . 
UNKNOWN Think we're the we're the envy of all the of all the other R_R_ teams , . 
UNKNOWN been cool . 
UNKNOWN I think So I I , you know , and I think we've co we have come we've come up with something new , something that hasn't been done before , we haven't we're not just rehashing an old design . 
UNKNOWN In four diff in in four meetings . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Funny , all designer meetings could be this quick . 
UNKNOWN You know , maybe this isn't a simulation , maybe this is actually so it's like Sony or someone like that they're they're just , yeah , they get Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah I think they're actually trying to find ideas for a ideal remote . 
UNKNOWN They're using our ideas . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , two years' time this will be on the market . 
UNKNOWN Ex exactly that product um thum we'll go , yeah , we designed that and no-one will believe us . 
UNKNOWN But um No , I think when this meeting's finished like officially , there b we'll get a uh questionnaire to fill in . 
UNKNOWN So at this stage , I mean , is this the last meeting of the project ? 
UNKNOWN We don't uh have another one after it's gone gone to marke market or something ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Y Oh really ? 
UNKNOWN Or six , uh I haven't got message . 
UNKNOWN Just start summarising now . 
UNKNOWN You can reply to the same message . 
UNKNOWN See summary , there . 
UNKNOWN If you just reply to that one . 
UNKNOWN So there's no way to like predict what our 'Cause we had a we originally had a As far as our financial uh um goals , we had a specific number for profits that we wanted . 
UNKNOWN It was fifty mil fifty million I don't remember . 
UNKNOWN Was it was it fifty or five ? 
UNKNOWN But there's not a way to compute that , I mean , since we saved on the on the production cost , do we know how much we're making on profit ? 
UNKNOWN It gets handed over to another department . 
UNKNOWN Depends how much we sell . 
CONFUSION Uh . 
UNKNOWN What our what our project was was to come up with the product , basically . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN the for the and just basically is it it come can is it within budget . 
UNKNOWN When it c when it comes to all the other things of how to sell it and , you know , the b the profits and all that that's other departments it's another team that actually work out the mai the oh yeah , the all the guys in the profit sharing , yeah . 
UNKNOWN But we have a vested interest prof profit sharing . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's it . 
UNKNOWN You know , we've we've we've made i we've made we've designed the product , we've ma we've got the prototype , it's within budget , it's does everything that we wanted it to do . 
UNKNOWN We finished an hour earlier . 
UNKNOWN It's new , it's it's um something that uh that isn't out there already . 
UNKNOWN I think actually and one advantage of of this is that after the uh , you know , after this fad of fruit and vegetables passes this will still be c a cool remote , you know . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN We're not we're not you know , tying tying our cart to that one horse . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well , this is very marketable in that it is it's it's something that's kind of new and looks a bit quirky for people who want that , it's that it's um , hang on , I wrote it down here somewhere Oh no I thi I put it in one of my e-mails that I sent off . 
UNKNOWN Definitely . 
UNKNOWN Um that , you know , it's marketable in the sense that it's whilst all these other remotes uh actually do give you repetitive strain injury , our one does the complete opposite , you know , so that's something that's new , which is one of the criteria they asked us to come up with something with something new . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN It make watching T_V_ healthy . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , and if you're not having a good time with the T_V_ , you can f throw it about , you know . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It's fine , it's kid proof . 
UNKNOWN Just don't sh don't throw it at any of the ornaments and break them . 
CONFUSION Uh . 
UNKNOWN Well , you can break the ornaments , but you won't break that . 
NEGATION No . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So all in all , I think we've done very well . 
UNKNOWN Mm yep . 
UNKNOWN Well done everybody . 
UNKNOWN Yay . 
UNKNOWN Right , you too . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Drinks are on the company . 
CONFIRMATION Cool . 
UNKNOWN In the corporate bar that's next to the corporate swimming pool on the top floor that we're that've all just gained access to . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Glad to hear that . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN That's it . 
UNKNOWN That's it . 
UNKNOWN Well , as far as I t as far as I know . 
CONFUSION Um . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN We haven't got the five minute left thing yet . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN Anyone wanna play I spy ? 
UNKNOWN Mm mm . 
UNKNOWN I guess it's probably better that we wrap it up than have five minutes of silence . 
UNKNOWN Should we call the day then ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I guess . 
UNKNOWN I mean we're gonna get asked to fill out another questionnaire . 
UNKNOWN Uh , right . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN It's probably gonna be the same as one we've done before . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN In project . 
UNKNOWN But I'm not the authority to say that it is . 
UNKNOWN Um how does everyone feel about the technology that's been used in this ? 
UNKNOWN The sort of using of the the pens and writing on these special pads and all that ? 
UNKNOWN I love it . 
UNKNOWN I love it . 
UNKNOWN I think it's cool . 
UNKNOWN Being all wired up and a vibrating pen and it's cool . 
UNKNOWN Being watched . 
UNKNOWN Um Wow . 
UNKNOWN Your moment to shine . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I thi you know , I'd I'd n yeah , as we said earlier , I've not never seen that before . 
UNKNOWN something that t the whiteboard thingy , that's great . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um , but a p a pen with a camera on it , I don't think it's such a new thing . 
UNKNOWN I mean it's i or in such a new idea . 
UNKNOWN It would be different if it was sort of hand writing recognition stuff , but as it's not it's literally that'll come up on a computer screen as a picture filerather than actual text . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Right , I think they do want to do hand writing recognition on that , it's just the first step . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Logitech . 
UNKNOWN I guess we should end this , since we're off off topic . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So . 
UNKNOWN Shall we Right . 
UNKNOWN Meeting adjourned . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Good morning everybody . 
UNKNOWN Um I'm glad you could all come . 
UNKNOWN I'm really excited to start this team . 
UNKNOWN Um I'm just gonna have a little PowerPointpresentationfor us , for our kick-off meeting . 
UNKNOWN My name is Rose Lindgren . 
UNKNOWN I I'll be the Project Manager . 
UNKNOWN Um our agendatoday is we are gonna do a little opening and then I'm gonna talk a little bit about the project , then we'll move into acquaintance such as getting to know each other a little bit , including a tool training exercise . 
UNKNOWN And then we'll move into the project plan , do a little discussion and close , since we only have twenty five minutes . 
UNKNOWN First of all our project aim . 
UNKNOWN Um we are creating a new remote control which we have three goals about , it needs to be original , trendy and user-friendly . 
UNKNOWN I'm hoping that we can all work together to achieve all three of those . 
UNKNOWN Um so we're gonna divide us up into three compa three parts . 
UNKNOWN First the functional design which will be uh first we'll do individual work , come into a meeting , the conceptional design , individual work and a meeting , and then the detailed design , individual work and a meeting . 
UNKNOWN So that we'll each be doing our own ideas and then coming together and um collaborating . 
UNKNOWN Okay , we're gonna get to know each other a little bit . 
UNKNOWN So um , what we're gonna do is start off with um let's start off with Amina . 
UNKNOWN Um Alima , sorry , Alima . 
UNKNOWN Alima . 
UNKNOWN Um we're gonna do a little tool training , so we are gonna work with that whiteboard behind you . 
UNKNOWN Um introduce yourself , um say one thing about yourself and then drawyour favourite animal and tell us about it . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um I don't know which one of these I have to bring with me . 
UNKNOWN Probably both . 
UNKNOWN Right , so , I'm supposed to drawmy favourite animal . 
UNKNOWN I have no drawingskills whatsoever . 
UNKNOWN But uh let's see , introduce myself . 
UNKNOWN My name is Alima Bucciantini . 
UNKNOWN Um I'm from the state of Maine in the US . 
UNKNOWN I'm doing nationalism studies , blah , blah , blah , and I have no artistic talents . 
UNKNOWN How do you spell your name ? 
UNKNOWN A_ L_ I_ M_ A_ . 
CONFIRMATION Thanks . 
UNKNOWN Oh , and I guess I'm the Industrial Designer on this project . 
UNKNOWN So let's see if I can get um here . 
UNKNOWN I will drawa little turtle for you all . 
UNKNOWN Not necessarily 'cause it's my absolute favourite animal , but just that I think they're drawable . 
UNKNOWN And you have the pretty little shell going on . 
UNKNOWN Some little eyes . 
UNKNOWN Happy . 
UNKNOWN There you go . 
UNKNOWN That's a turtle . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN So what are your favourite characteristics ? 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN I I like the whole having a shell thing . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN It's quite cool carry your home around where you go , um quite decorative little animals , they can swim , they can , they're very adaptable , they carry everything they need with them , um and they're easy to draw. 
CONFIRMATION Excellent . 
UNKNOWN Shall we just go around the table ? 
UNKNOWN Uh Okay . 
UNKNOWN Well , my name is Iain uh and I'm the User Interface Designer for the project . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN And I'll try and drawmy favourite animal . 
UNKNOWN I'll I should leave that one on there shouldn't I before I callously rub it off . 
UNKNOWN No , you can erase the turtle , it's alright . 
UNKNOWN Might be nice to have them all up there at same time . 
UNKNOWN Um I'm not gonna drawit quite to scale um . 
UNKNOWN Is that at least identifiable ? 
UNKNOWN Snake . 
UNKNOWN Well . 
UNKNOWN It's a whale , yes . 
UNKNOWN Em Mm 'kay . 
UNKNOWN Well , snake ? 
UNKNOWN It's w Oh , a cat . 
CONFIRMATION Thanks . 
UNKNOWN Oh my god , it's better than what I'm gonna be able to do . 
UNKNOWN Um and , yeah , the reason I like whales is 'cause uh they're well , first of all they're quite intelligent um and also they're they're kind of mysterious , like we don't really know much about them or or understand how they work , how they form groups . 
UNKNOWN And I just find them interesting animals . 
UNKNOWN Take my contraptions with me . 
UNKNOWN Alright , I'm Jessy . 
UNKNOWN I'm from around D_C_ ish sort of in the U_S_ . 
UNKNOWN And we're gonna keep the deep sea sort of theme going on , animal . 
UNKNOWN Don't really know how to drawthis . 
UNKNOWN Just where can I Mm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Maybe if I do the water , but how ? 
UNKNOWN Sort of give an idea . 
UNKNOWN I have no idea how one would explain this . 
UNKNOWN Mm maybe with some whiskers . 
UNKNOWN Briefly , it's supposed to be a seal . 
UNKNOWN You can imagine it in the water . 
UNKNOWN I like them , because they are like playful and silly sort of have a good time . 
UNKNOWN Not gonna try and pretend like I can get any better than that . 
UNKNOWN Mm 'kay ? 
UNKNOWN I'm Rose and I'm Project Manager , from California . 
CONFUSION Um . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN S Um it's actually a coyote . 
UNKNOWN It's definitely significantly harder once you are doing it . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Let's see . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Let's see , let's give it a little bit of a snout , I don't know , some teeth . 
UNKNOWN That's impressive . 
UNKNOWN That's That's pretty impressive . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Cool . 
UNKNOWN Oh dear . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN I live um I live right across the street from an open space in California . 
UNKNOWN We have coyotes howl all the time . 
UNKNOWN So I really enjoy their their singing , you they're really beautiful animals . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Okay um , moving on to slightly more serious stuff . 
UNKNOWN We're gonna talk about project finances . 
UNKNOWN Um we have a couple we'd like to sell it for about twenty five Euro with the profit aim of um fifteen million Euro um from our sales and because this is such this is for television it's a we have a market range of Internet , like it's an international market range , we don't have to worry about specifics . 
UNKNOWN Um in order to make a profit of this magnitude , we need to um be able to produce each one at a maximum of twelve fifty Euro . 
UNKNOWN So we're selling it for twice what we'd like to produce it for . 
UNKNOWN Okay um , just to generate a little bit of discussion about the project um , I could I'd like to hear about your experiences using ro remote controls , um your first ideas about um creating a new r remote control , what would be the best um like you what are the features that you really like what are the features that you don't like , etcetera , so Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um I hate when there's like four different buttons and you have to press to actually turn on the T_V_ like you have to do one for the power of the T_V_ and then like another one to get the actual screen on and something else to get it all going , I don't know . 
UNKNOWN Now they keep combining all different remotes together , and I don't know if I necessarily like that 'cause I feel like you end up with multimedia overload . 
UNKNOWN I just wanna watch the T_V_ um . 
UNKNOWN Always gets lost . 
UNKNOWN Some sort of like device to help you find it . 
UNKNOWN I've used , I've used remote controls , for things like T_V_ and the C_D_ player and video recorder and I I guess they're they're pretty neat neat little tools uh . 
UNKNOWN You don't have to get up and walk across the room to change a channel . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN So especially if you're someone really lazy like me they they're pretty nice . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN I find them they can be a bit annoying , especially , like you know if I'm watching T_V_ I have have to have three separate remote controls of in front of me , you know , one for the T_V_ , one for the digital box , one for m the video recorder as well . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN And also they tend to they tend to be a bit confusing , they've got too many buttons on them uh too too sort of too sort of complicated when all I really wanna do is switch on and off , change the channel , change the volume . 
UNKNOWN Yeah um . 
UNKNOWN I agree with having too many remotes around . 
UNKNOWN My dad has a whole drawer at home of remotes for various things , and I don't know how to work half of them um . 
UNKNOWN What's important for me , I guess , is that it's easy to use and that there's not too many buttons , they are not too small , you know you know you need to n to know what you're doing . 
UNKNOWN And one thing I particularly like is if you are not um sort of moving it around to get it to work with the infra-red . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um , I think there is a way around that , but I know in my residence right now the the television you sort of have to walk all around the room to get it to turn on , so i it's just simpler just to just turn around the T_V_ itself , and I think that's if we're gonna make a remote control , it should actually work for what it's doing . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So I know . 
UNKNOWN What about like batteries and things like that , like are there some remotes that don don't require like batteries or do all remotes require batteries ? 
UNKNOWN Um I would imagine all of them , but we could but it's possible we could use like a lithium battery um that would last a lot longer than like double A_s . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , something that doesn't Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um like tho those are the batteries that are used in a lot of um M_P_ three players now and that kind of thing . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFUSION Um . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Okay , it seems we have a little bit of a conflict over um to uh combining all the remotes cont together versus having f five different remotes . 
UNKNOWN So um like you said you don't like having all the buttons on one on one remote , and yet you don't wanna have five remotes . 
UNKNOWN So how do we work with that ? 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Could we get something that just has No doesn't have all the buttons that you need to program the video recorder or program s other things that I'm not very coherent about , but that just has your major buttons for that work for everything , you know volume control , on , off , channel changing . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN And maybe that spatially divides it , so it's like if you're looki if you're trying to get the T_V_ on that's , you know , like the top thing on the remote , I dunno if d be vertical or horizontal in terms of how we're gonna make it , but if it's like all the T_V_ stuff was here , then all the V_C_R_ stuff was here , all the whatever else we have programmed into it it's all just in its separate place and not like all the on buttons together , 'cause then you like , I don't even know what I'm turning on . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN N that way Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , and if um if you'd save the more complicated functions maybe for separate remotes that you wouldn't need to use every day . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so maybe have like one remote that has the main functions on , off , channel changing , volume , and another rote remote with all the special things . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Because that is one thing that um remotes tend to have buttons that the T_V_s no longer have as well . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN So like you have to have them somewhere , 'cause you're gonna m need those special functions occasionally . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Um but not necessarily on the m the normal remote . 
UNKNOWN Can I ask , are we designing a remote control for a television only um , and if if this device is just to be used for the television would we even technically be possible to include video recorder functions on it ? 
UNKNOWN Good question . 
UNKNOWN I don't know that yet . 
UNKNOWN Um or should we just stick to just stick to having television television related buttons on it ? 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN It's a good question . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm hmm . 
UNKNOWN I'll look into that . 
UNKNOWN If I can . 
UNKNOWN I think it's just T_V_ , I mean , if it if we're taking it just new product a new television remote control that's not like doesn't say . 
UNKNOWN Mm yeah . 
UNKNOWN You know , things might be more advanced than that . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN So we should maybe we should assume that i t it's just a television that we're wanting to control . 
UNKNOWN Well , I mean I suppose it would be nice to have playing and record and stop buttons on it for the video recorder as well I I don't know if that works technologically or not . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN I guess we have to define what what we're aiming for . 
UNKNOWN If it's just a television then that it's a bit simpler , 'cause there's less buttons that would even need to be on it . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It's an idea with the buttons being really . 
UNKNOWN Large . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN If you have older people or people like me that aren't very co-ordinated hand-eye , it's really quite important that you are not pressing a small like teeny mobiles phone size buttons , if we can help it . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN 'Kay sounds like we've had a good little discussion for our first ideas . 
UNKNOWN Mind if we move on ? 
UNKNOWN Ps mm okay . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um now our next meeting starts in thirty minutes . 
UNKNOWN I believe we've actually been only working on this this one for about twenty , so we can continue discussing more new ideas if you'd like um , but this is just a breakdown of what we'll be doing individually . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um the industrial design , Alima will be doing um the working design . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um the User Interface Designer , that's for . 
UNKNOWN Technical functions , I guess like keeping in mind the buttons thing , the size of the buttons . 
UNKNOWN Um user requirements um , so you'll be hearing about different trends , uh about different things that people need , um I guess kind of the same uh discussion that we've been having , we'll get from the actual consum s consumers . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Mm 'kay um . 
UNKNOWN And you will get specific instructions sent by your personal coach . 
UNKNOWN I realised in this past one we we didn't have much , we just wanted to get a little brain-storming done . 
UNKNOWN Um so very exited to see all your animals and how what wonderful um artists we all are um . 
UNKNOWN Any questions ? 
UNKNOWN What we're gonna be discussing at the next meeting ? 
UNKNOWN Do we know that ? 
UNKNOWN I haven't gotten an agendayet , um I'll put that together . 
UNKNOWN I'm sure as we'll each get our own instruction and then um because what we gonna do is first our individual actions and then we'll come back together . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN So I'm sure we'll all have more concrete things to contribute next time Mm 'kay um I'll type up mi minutesand probably emailthose out to all of you . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN I'm sure we'll be busy . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um just including all the things that we talked about . 
UNKNOWN Can you e-mail your slidesas well ? 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Is that possible ? 
UNKNOWN Yes , I yes , I think I can . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Cool . 
UNKNOWN I'll just attach it to an email. 
UNKNOWN And you're you're number two , three , four ? 
UNKNOWN I'm two . 
UNKNOWN I'm four . 
UNKNOWN Is that correct ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
CONFIRMATION Excellent . 
UNKNOWN It was lovely meeting you all . 
UNKNOWN 'Kay Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Just make sure you keep checking the company web site and the emails . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN Let me see if I can do that right now . 
UNKNOWN Mm 'kay . 
UNKNOWN Good to see you all again . 
UNKNOWN Let's see if that comes up . 
UNKNOWN This is our functional design meeting . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Just a sec while my PowerPointcomes up . 
UNKNOWN Et voila . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Mm um we put the fashion in electronics . 
UNKNOWN Let's start . 
UNKNOWN Okay , our agendatoday um just check the time , it's twelve thirteen . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN I'm gonna do an opening , talk about um did you all get the minutes? 
UNKNOWN I e-mailed them to you . 
UNKNOWN I'm also putting 'em them in the shared folder . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN So um then I we'll talk about our general objectives and have your three presentations. 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Um I'll talk about the new project requirements I've just received , and then we have to make a decision on our remote control functions . 
UNKNOWN Finally we'll just close . 
UNKNOWN We're starting this meeting at approximately twelve thirteen and we have forty minutes . 
UNKNOWN So First of all the functional design objectives . 
UNKNOWN Uh we need to keep in mind the user requirement specification , what needs and desires are to be fulfilled , the functions design , what effects the apparatus should have , and the working design , how the apparatus actually works to fulfil its function . 
UNKNOWN Okay , three presentations, um you can go in any order you choose um . 
UNKNOWN Mm shall we go in the order that you just did it ? 
UNKNOWN Sure , please do . 
UNKNOWN I dunno . 
UNKNOWN How do I hook my screen up ? 
UNKNOWN I think , you might have to disconnect Rose . 
UNKNOWN Yes I do . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well there's a wee a wee plug just just that one there Ah that's it , yep . 
UNKNOWN Where does it go ? 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Hmm , I'm not supposed to move this , but Where's function ? 
UNKNOWN And then you have to press function F_ eight I think it is on your laptop . 
UNKNOWN Function , F_ eight , yeah . 
UNKNOWN The blue one , F_N_ . 
UNKNOWN No signal . 
UNKNOWN Is it plugged in all the way and you screwed it in and Mm 'kay . 
UNKNOWN Ah , wait , 's screw in . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I I think you just have to push it in really hard . 
UNKNOWN Push the screw . 
UNKNOWN That's it . 
UNKNOWN Oh , got it . 
UNKNOWN Mm alright I've never attached to anything . 
UNKNOWN It's taking it a little bit 'Kay there you go . 
UNKNOWN Mm , neither have I . 
UNKNOWN Alright , so , I don't know if you guys are able to get access to um the reportthat was online or if I'm the only one who is . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
UNKNOWN But , I don't even know how to play this . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN Press the little presentation. 
UNKNOWN It's the um it looks like a Y_ kind of over there above Draw. 
UNKNOWN There , that one , there you go . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
UNKNOWN So we're just gonna talk a little bit about the functional requirements that people specified when they were asked . 
UNKNOWN Um I guess Real Reaction did some market research . 
UNKNOWN They had a hundred subjects and their usability lab and they watched them watch T_V_ and recorded the frequency that they used particular buttons and the relevance that those buttons had . 
UNKNOWN What they found was they analysed people's desires and needs . 
UNKNOWN Focusing on their desires , um people specifically said that they thought remotes were ugly , seventy five per cent of the a hundred subjects noted that and that they more importantly though , eighty per cent said that they would be willing to pay more for a fancier looking remote . 
UNKNOWN I don't know anything beyond what fancy means , but that's particularly of use to us , I think . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um also they did some questions on voice recognition and found that the desire for voice recognition was inversely related to age , so younger people were more inclined to want something with voice recognition , whereas the older people in the like sixty and above segment or so did not really think that they would pay more money for voice recognitions . 
UNKNOWN Um people also had certain frustrations , that I think that we could try to take into consideration with our design . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN That being people k um frustrated with losing their remotes . 
UNKNOWN I think , over fifty percent of the people mentioned that that was their biggest frustration . 
UNKNOWN People are also frustrated with the difficulty it is to learn how to use a remote and I think that ties back to what you were saying before just that there's too many buttons , it just needs to be easy to use . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN It also mentioned something called R_S_I_ and I was hoping someone might be able to inform me as to what R_S_I_ is , because I don't know . 
UNKNOWN Repetitive strain injury . 
UNKNOWN What ? 
UNKNOWN Repetitive strain injury . 
UNKNOWN Ah . 
UNKNOWN There we go . 
UNKNOWN Wow . 
UNKNOWN So if you Cheers . 
UNKNOWN People do not like that . 
UNKNOWN So I guess sort of the carpal tunnel type thing , people do not like that , um the repetitive use , I guess , caused a strain . 
UNKNOWN Um looking at the needs people specified , the problem right now is that people's remotes are not matching their operating behaviour . 
UNKNOWN People are only using ten per cent of the buttons that they have offered to them on their remote . 
UNKNOWN And what people do most often is changing the channel and changing the volume . 
UNKNOWN People also zap like to change the channel , about um sixty five per cent during an hour of use . 
UNKNOWN So we really just need to focus in on those volumes and channel changers rather than things like the audio settings , the screen settings and the channel settings , because they're used much more infrequently and probably just complicate what's going on . 
UNKNOWN So I think that some things that we might wanna think about , the idea of an L_C_D_ screen was brought up although they didn't have any details on what people's preferences on that were , so I dunno know if that's coming to me later , or something like that . 
UNKNOWN But something for us to consider also just the phenomenon that less is more when it comes to the buttons on the remote or what we wanna make easiest to use , make sure that , you know , something like an audio setting isn't given as much importance and visibility on the remote as something like channel changing that's used a lot more often . 
UNKNOWN And basically in order for us to win over to the consumer we just need to focus on what it looks like , that it has a fancy appeal and that it's not ugly and that it feels like the way they're gonna use it , so it doesn't give them any hand injuries or things like that . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
THANKS Thank you very much . 
UNKNOWN That was that was great . 
UNKNOWN Mm 'kay . 
UNKNOWN Um 's move on to the next presentationum on effects . 
UNKNOWN Was that you ? 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Great . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , have I unscrewed it ? 
UNKNOWN Push . 
UNKNOWN User interface , right . 
UNKNOWN Interface . 
UNKNOWN Here we go . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN And I think that's in the shared , if I did it right , if anyone wants to look at it . 
UNKNOWN Mm 'kay , thank you . 
UNKNOWN Okay , great . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Here we go . 
UNKNOWN Right so I'm gonna talk about the technical technical functions design of the remote control um . 
UNKNOWN We need to start by considering what a remote control actually is . 
UNKNOWN It's a device that allows us to produce certain effects on our television , so i it's basically a communication device . 
UNKNOWN We we tell the remote control what we want to do , it sends a message to the television saying change the channel , change the volume , uh yeah , adjust these settings , adjust the brightness . 
UNKNOWN Um how do we actually go about designing a new television remote control ? 
UNKNOWN First thing to do is to come up with the design specifications . 
UNKNOWN We need to know what our final product is gonna be like , so we need a a clear idea of exactly what this product does , uh how it works , and what the end-user is gonna want from this product . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Oh , a way I'd suggest that we could go about this is by designing uh several different prototypes of user interfaces for this product , um and then uh trying to get some feedback uh about h how well these particular prototypes work , uh sorta find out what people think of 'em . 
UNKNOWN Um using a remote control is is quite a subjective experience . 
UNKNOWN Um , and different different people sort of prefer different things . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um we should remember that remote controls are a a fairly standard piece of equipment . 
UNKNOWN When a users using a remote control , he or she expects the buttons to be in certain places . 
UNKNOWN So in some sense we're gonna we're gonna have to aim for a device which is fairly conventional in design uh so that we're not completely shocking people . 
UNKNOWN But I think within that there is also room for us to introduce novel ideas uh and to make something that's that's perhaps a little bit different , something that stands out . 
UNKNOWN Um also in in designing the user interface we need to consider practicalities . 
UNKNOWN Uh the first of these is is technological ye uh what can we do with the current state of technology as it is . 
UNKNOWN The second is is economic , uh we need to find a balance between features and price . 
UNKNOWN So as you mentioned things like voice recognition would would add to the price uh but it would also im improve the design of the product . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN So I had a look on the on the web uh to see if I could find a few examples of existing television remote controls . 
UNKNOWN In analysing these we can consider what what things what's good about them , uh what things do they get right , what's bad about them , what's wrong with 'em , um how we can improve on the designsthat that that I found and what can we do to make our product stand out from from the large majority of remote controls . 
UNKNOWN Here's two examples uh probably at the extreme ends of the spectrum . 
UNKNOWN Um on the left here we've got uh an engineering-based design for a remote control , so it's one that's got lots of buttons , it's it's fully featured , everything you might possibly want to do is there , you know , it's got forward , backwards , up , down , channel numbers , volume , uh freeze frame . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , it's it's fully featured and it might take a while to get to learn to use it , but once you've learned it you can you can do whatever you want with your T_V_ . 
UNKNOWN The one on the right is a lot more basic . 
UNKNOWN It's just got the essential functions of the T_V_ changing the channel , play , stop , volume . 
UNKNOWN It would be a lot quicker to learn to use it , but again th it's it's swings and roundabouts . 
UNKNOWN There are disadvantages , you can't use it say to to freeze the television picture . 
UNKNOWN Uh there's a lot of features that are missing from that remote control . 
UNKNOWN So we've got to to find our find a way of striking a balance between the two . 
UNKNOWN Um as I said before , remote controls are subjective , different people want want different things . 
UNKNOWN Um personally wa what I want from a remote control is a device that's simple , it it's easy to use , uh it's got big buttons for doing the things I do most often , changing the volume , changing the channel . 
UNKNOWN It it does everything that I need it to uh , as I said before , I'm quite lazy , I don't wanna walk across the room just to adjust my television . 
UNKNOWN I also want something that that looks cool , um and that that feels good , that's ergonomically designed . 
UNKNOWN Mm 'kay . 
THANKS Thank you very much . 
UNKNOWN That was very useful . 
UNKNOWN It's funny to see the drastic difference between those two remotes . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN And neither of them were very pretty , you know ? 
NEGATION No . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think that could be our selling point . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN A fashion fashion remote . 
UNKNOWN I think there's there's certainly a market for technology that looks cool . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN And I think that's that's why companies like Apple've 've 've made a lot of progress . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Right , I really can't see what I'm doing , so does anyone have a Ah-ha , look at that , showing up already . 
UNKNOWN You there it is . 
CONFIRMATION Lovely . 
UNKNOWN So wait , did it let you go on the Internet or was that just what it let you see ? 
UNKNOWN Uh that was just on the d on the company web site , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause I was like googling and then I'm like wait it won't let me google . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Alright um No , how do I play again ? 
UNKNOWN Um the it's right above Draw. 
UNKNOWN There are three thingy if it's way at the bottom . 
UNKNOWN Ah . 
UNKNOWN Under three icons and it's the one that looks like a desk . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that one . 
UNKNOWN There are Y_s . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So this is our working design presentation. 
UNKNOWN Um I had a bit of some issues with this , because I wasn't able to find everything I needed , but I guess that's we're still in early stages . 
UNKNOWN Um so , yeah , this is this . 
UNKNOWN Though th the thing about working design is the what we're trying to do as a working design is figure out how the aparata apparatus can fulfil its function . 
UNKNOWN Um one of the examples that kept coming up for me is that a coffee grinder . 
UNKNOWN It works because it converts electrical energy to grinding the beans and then you put the bean through a filter and that filters out , and then you get coffee at the end that's nice and hot because of the combination of electrical energy and then the other things that are brought in to make it work . 
UNKNOWN Don't know if I'm explaining that very well , but how do I get to the next s ah . 
UNKNOWN So h the method as um working designers figure out what you need to make it fulfil this practical function , what what needs to be done and how do we convert all the elements to make that done . 
UNKNOWN So wha the easiest thing to do is to break down all the points at which you need something to happen . 
UNKNOWN So you make a schematic of the way that the the energy is converted tsh towards this practical function . 
UNKNOWN And then I think the easiest thing to do is gonna be work on each task separately . 
UNKNOWN So um Uh . 
UNKNOWN You just press yeah , just click . 
CONFUSION Uh . 
UNKNOWN That'll be fine . 
UNKNOWN So the findings that I got uh very just very briefly is that you have a choice of the way that the information is projected to the receiver and in my opinion infra-red is the best way to do that 'cause you don't need a sight line . 
UNKNOWN So that's one thing we're gonna work on . 
UNKNOWN Um the user interface is critical here , because a lot of the things that happen in a remote control happen through the chip that controls that converts the electrical energy into data , which then goes through the infra-red , so the the chip that uh I think Ian is designing , is gonna be crucial . 
UNKNOWN And really it all comes down to the to the user , because they're the one that's controlling most of the working design . 
UNKNOWN So the components that we find here are the energy source , you know the battery or whatever that's gonna m make it work , then the chip , which converts the data , the user that's controlling the chip , and the infra-red bulb that's gonna let us move the data to the receiver . 
UNKNOWN So you have four main components and they are designed sort of like this . 
UNKNOWN You have your energy source right there which then um brings uh energy or information to the chip , which is also controlled by the users . 
UNKNOWN You have energy going to the user who's controlling the chip ooh 's not what I wanted to do uh uh . 
UNKNOWN Um yeah use that thing you can go back , previous . 
UNKNOWN Previous . 
UNKNOWN Sorry about that , guys . 
UNKNOWN Pardon . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN No , no , no , no , no . 
UNKNOWN Oh , well . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Okay , let's just get back to my schematic here . 
UNKNOWN Ye Double click on it . 
UNKNOWN With the right with the left hand one . 
UNKNOWN W yeah , yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think it's frozen . 
UNKNOWN Here . 
UNKNOWN Don't show me that tip again . 
UNKNOWN There we are . 
UNKNOWN There we are . 
UNKNOWN Sorry about this , guys . 
UNKNOWN I'm kind of pathetic with things like this . 
UNKNOWN Um alright . 
UNKNOWN So you have your energy source , your user interface who's controlling the chip , the chip also uses the energy , and the chip through the use of the user interface is gonna control the switch which will work your infra-red bulb , which will then bring the data to the receiver . 
UNKNOWN So hopefully that makes sense for everyone in my kind of garbled way . 
UNKNOWN This is the the parts of the working design that need to be figured out . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN And personal preferences , besides the fact that I can't spell , we need a long-lasting energy source , people don't wanna be changing it a lot . 
UNKNOWN We need a chip that works well with the user interface , that isn't too complicated . 
UNKNOWN We need a straightforward interface , like Ian was saying , simple , not overwhelming it with information and we need a reliable and clear infra-red signal , so that you're not waving your remote around and having to get frustrated and go do it by hands . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So that's pretty much it for the working design . 
CONFIRMATION Excellent . 
UNKNOWN So , um . 
UNKNOWN Rose , do you think you can give me a hand with this ? 
UNKNOWN Yes , absolutely . 
UNKNOWN Ah I can never tell which way to turn these things . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Lefty loosey , righty tighty , right ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN What's up ? 
UNKNOWN Lefty loosey . 
UNKNOWN Lefty loosey , righty tighty . 
CONFUSION Uh . 
UNKNOWN Never heard that before , that's good . 
UNKNOWN Oh yes . 
UNKNOWN I'll think of that every time now . 
UNKNOWN It's gonna stick in your head . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's a good one it'll stick with you . 
UNKNOWN Mm 'kay . 
UNKNOWN Um I have nothing on my screen . 
UNKNOWN Just a sec . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Here we are . 
UNKNOWN Ooh , no signal . 
UNKNOWN Okay , yeah , it's fine . 
UNKNOWN Okay , requirements . 
UNKNOWN We have a couple new requirements that I was just e-mailed right before the meeting and that we have to keep in in um in mind as we're creating this . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN We didn't bring it up yet , or at all in the meetings so far , but we're not gonna work with teletext because um well it that's been taken over by the internet , so we're not gonna worry about um we're not gonna worry about that . 
UNKNOWN What's teletext ? 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Uh , it's a British thing . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN You don't have it in the States ? 
UNKNOWN Oh , so Mm-hmm . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN It no . 
UNKNOWN W d could would you care to explain it ? 
UNKNOWN Oh , I didn't realise . 
UNKNOWN Um yeah , it's like a I suppose it's kind of similar to a very very basic web browser . 
UNKNOWN Um you have like you have uh numbers on your remote control , uh y and you type in the pagenumber you want , so like you type a hundred on your remote control and this this kind of index appears on the television screen with just some some text and some very blocky looking graphics on it . 
UNKNOWN And you just type numbers to go to different pagesand it gives you information , mostly rather boring stuff like what's on T_V_ next and share prices and that kind of thing . 
UNKNOWN S Lottery numbers and sport scores . 
UNKNOWN Yep , news headlines . 
UNKNOWN But if you ever see the T_V_ saying like go to pageone sixty on Ceefax now , that's what they're talking about . 
UNKNOWN How ? 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN It's earl it's pretty old technology . 
UNKNOWN It's like nineteen eighties . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN That explains a lot . 
UNKNOWN I have no idea why we don't have it , but 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN That's good . 
UNKNOWN Interesting . 
UNKNOWN Okay um , well , we're not gonna the management has decided we're not gonna work with that . 
UNKNOWN Um Okay um and we're also gonna w like your question earlier um whether this is going to be t for television , video , or etcetera . 
UNKNOWN Just for television . 
UNKNOWN That's what we're focused on . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Um otherwise becomes to complex , we wanna get this out um very quickly . 
UNKNOWN We only have a a short amount of time . 
UNKNOWN Um and finally there's more marketing , I think , um , our corporate image has to be recognisable . 
UNKNOWN So while we're gonna make it look pretty we need to use our colour and our slogan i in the new design . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN So what's our corporate image like ? 
UNKNOWN It's It's kind of yellow colour with uh we put fashion in electronics . 
UNKNOWN Looks like , yeah , kind of a yellow and black and we have that the emphasis on the R_s in um mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN It's like double R_ . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But it's , yeah , we put the um fashion in electronics . 
UNKNOWN So we gotta keep that in that in mind . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so we want something that looks good and is yellow . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , or ha maybe some buttons could be yellow . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Like , we can we can play around with it a little bit . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Okay , we need to talk about our functions and our target group . 
UNKNOWN We need to decide who our target group is . 
UNKNOWN You um in your analysis of different market um of the marketing , you identified that different groups wanted different things or had certain preferences , for example that um that older people didn't really care for um voice recognition , but younger people did . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um and so who are we aiming this at ? 
UNKNOWN Well if we're gonna say that function um fashion we put the fashion in in electronics then you automatically , I think , a sort of younger group that that's who's gonna be attracted to this . 
UNKNOWN Yes , I do think , who's gonna have the money to buy that also , that one ? 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN It's gonna be twenty five Euro remember , so um it has to be avai marketable to um whomever it is . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Is it is it something that's gonna be sold separately from the television or is it something that comes w with a television ? 
UNKNOWN 'Cause that would affect the way that we market it . 
UNKNOWN Well at least right now what we're doing is um deciding on just the remote itself , so it will probably be sold separately , twenty five Euro by itself . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Right , okay . 
UNKNOWN The only break-down that I was given in terms of age was the voice activation and basically there's a big jump , after thirty five people don't really care if it has voice , so it's like basically fifteen to thirty five that think that that's a good idea . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN I dunno I'm gonna be given any other numbers broken down in terms of age later , but if that's sort of the only quality that we have that is divided into age then we would wanna stick between the fifteen and thirty five range . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's probably uh a population w quite a little bit of disposable income for use on technology anyway , so that might be a fairly good target group for us . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Now , those are that's all specific for speech recognition . 
UNKNOWN Are we gonna use that as one of our functions ? 
CONFUSION Um . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN I I would say no , because it's gonna add too much to the price . 
UNKNOWN Especially if we are marketing it as a separate product , people are gonna be paying uh , well , uh we've got a price limit of was it twelve twelve and a half Euros for to produce it ? 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN To produce it , yeah . 
UNKNOWN To produce it , yes . 
UNKNOWN And I wonder if we can get voice recognition into that twelve and a half Euros without having to make too many other compromises . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN But what else are we gonna put , I mean not that I'm really gung-ho about it , I don't know what else you can put in a remote to make it technologically advanced though . 
UNKNOWN So like other than just making it look good , how is it I mean it can look really great and still have the same up-n-down buttons and why's anyone gonna buy a new remote ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
CONFIRMATION But Right . 
UNKNOWN Well but why are we why are we aiming for a technological advancement ? 
UNKNOWN Everything we're talking about is ease of use and simple and that doesn't necessarily mean more technology , in fact it could use it could mean , not . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN That's a good thing to keep in mind . 
UNKNOWN If they might be overwhelmed with with remotes that have too many buttons and too much technology . 
UNKNOWN If someone's looking to buy a new remote , don't they want like an upgrade ? 
UNKNOWN I dunno . 
UNKNOWN Upgrade ? 
UNKNOWN Well , we can look for we can look at upgrade or we can look at um user-friendly . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , simplification . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Simplification , so Uh-huh , mm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN They could have a crap remote that came with their T_V_ that's just impossible to use , or maybe it broke , or maybe they're just missing it . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN And we also need to talk about if we're only gonna have the very simple ones or also have the other ones just separate somehow or Kind of pull out of the side . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Can you like I mean this may be too complicated , but , I wish I had something to explain it , like if it was just a simple , either this way or this way , that had like the main buttons and then you could like pull something out , kind of and like you got the rest the buttons , but the rest of them like went in . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Ooh . 
UNKNOWN The remote There are remote controls like that , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Do you know what I'm saying ? 
UNKNOWN Like some T_V_s they have a sort of uh a sliding screen on the remote control of it that hides all the complicated buttons . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Ooh . 
UNKNOWN So if you wanna do something complicated like programme your television or re-tune it , then you you open up this little hatch or or slidethe screen down and there's all the all the special buttons . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause then 's like people who don't wanna ever look at them , never even have to see them and if you like get the instruction manual that comes with it and you just don't even read it then you'll never even know that those things can pull out . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN And you're a happy person and everyone else doesn't have to have like two remotes , one that has the easy ones and one that has more complicated ones , but 's all still in one . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's a good idea . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN I think that's a good idea , yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Um we have to be careful that that that doesn't impede um the chip transmitting information , but um that's gonna be mostly technological thing . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Good point . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Okay um , so what are we emphasising ? 
UNKNOWN I what in this project ? 
UNKNOWN Si simplicity and fashion . 
UNKNOWN I think simplicity , fashion . 
UNKNOWN Simplicity and fashion . 
UNKNOWN Yeah mm . 
UNKNOWN Okay , those are very good goals , I think , um that we have to keep in mind in with everything we do . 
UNKNOWN Simplicity and fashion and , yeah , or usability speci however you wanna say that , which includes um an emphasis on making the infra-red very functional , so that you don't have to travel around a lot . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN What can you do to like make the infra-red more functional , like why would it not be ? 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN I'm just wondering . 
UNKNOWN I think it's a lot to do with battery , but that's just my Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN The battery and that I think that the chip takes the data and presents it well , without sort of scattering . 
UNKNOWN So 's just the quality of the chip . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think so . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN The quality uh quality of all the components really , I mean , we can't really do anything shoddy work , 'cause it's gonna be visible down the line . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So our target group , we're saying , fifteen to thirty five ? 
UNKNOWN Well , I dunno how useful that number is if we're not doing Yeah . 
UNKNOWN S voice recognition , which I kind of I kind of feel like voice recognition is not necessary in a remote control , like it might be necessary for a T_V_ but not for the remote c , you know . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I don't . 
UNKNOWN It's , yeah , it's pretty it's pretty high-tech . 
UNKNOWN Mm-mm . 
UNKNOWN Seems a little bit Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , and it might be too expensive . 
UNKNOWN And if the whole idea is you're using a remote then why would you have voice , like you know what I mean and then it's like you wouldn't need a remote you'd just talk to your T_V_ . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It's for , like , the ultimately lazy people , who can't even be bothered to pick up the remote . 
UNKNOWN Ooh . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Mm yeah . 
UNKNOWN Maybe I mean if I get m more numbers , I'll e-mail you before the next meeting in terms of ages . 
UNKNOWN I Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN But this doesn't divide up anything and there was only a hundred subjects also , which isn't , I mean , really isn't that representative , especially if it's a hundred subjects that th they then can subdivide into age groups that means there's very few in each age group , so Twenty to like fifty five . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but I th I think regardless we're we're aiming for the under sixty five or something . 
UNKNOWN Under sixty five , okay , that's a good start . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN I'd say we're uh can we narrow it down to maybe um teenagers and families ? 
UNKNOWN 'Cause that would go up to like fifty ? 
UNKNOWN Or like single professionals or something . 
UNKNOWN Okay , single It's it's hard to narrow it down . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I dunno . 
UNKNOWN It's really hard to figure out right now . 
UNKNOWN I think the product appeals across a quite a broad range of ages . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN I mean , we we said simplicity is is one of the features , so it's going to appeal to people , maybe people who have problems with technology , you know , people who get scared by having lots of buttons , and that might be older people , but then we've also got fashion , which is something that definitely appeals to younger people . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well maybe we don't have to defi define the target group by the demographic of age , maybe we can define it by like the demographic of like h t how much money they have to spend or something like that , like , well obviously it has to be someone who owns a television , and like how recently have they bought their television like that sort of thing . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah aim for a an income group . 
UNKNOWN That's a good point . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN So maybe it's more useful to d d to define objectives like fashion and simplicity than to find specific target group as far as age is because , yeah , things so different will appeal to different people , but Okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , t probably . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um oh , there're a couple functions do we want something so that do we want some kind of thing to find it if it's lost ? 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Like a button on a T_V_ you can press and it'll ring or something , I don't know like or beep ? 
UNKNOWN H I mean , like I said before , fifty per cent of of the fru f like frustration someone can have that was the biggest one and half the people said that happened and we all mentioned it before we knew about it . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And if we're talking about making something easy that sort of goes along with it so it wouldn't be like a random thing to sort of add in . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN It would be relevant to like the overall goal I think , so Hmm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that'll probably be good . 
UNKNOWN Okay , we have to we have about four minutes left to define our functions . 
UNKNOWN So let's do that quickly . 
UNKNOWN Um so we want something to keep it from getting lost . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And we want um we want large buttons for the essential things . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Large , accessible buttons for the essentials . 
UNKNOWN We want a possibility to um to get um a possibility to get the extra functions . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Which are kind of hidden away in some way or well not hidden but they're uh they're not as prominent as the main features . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um , yeah , hidden way . 
UNKNOWN And we also want it to be fashionable , which I'm not sure if that's a function so much as a um yeah Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN on your coffee table , it's not like an eye sore , that kind of thing . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
UNKNOWN Okay , do it . 
UNKNOWN Any other essential functions that we need ? 
UNKNOWN Battery ? 
UNKNOWN Do we need a long-life battery ? 
UNKNOWN Battery battery use . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but I think that goes in with simplicity and ease of use really . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But we might as well . 
UNKNOWN So you never have to change the battery . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN We should maybe investigate whether it needs a battery at all . 
UNKNOWN I suspect the remote control does need a battery , but I dunno if you can Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I would imagine . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Just 'cause it is an electronic device , the Charging . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN It I think it does . 
UNKNOWN I don't I don't think of a way you can operate a chip and convert that much data without without one . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , without the energy , yeah . 
UNKNOWN But you could maybe have it in a little charging station like a mobile phone , or like a little cradle for your iPod . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's that's possible . 
UNKNOWN You could we could maybe do that instead . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So you don't ha you got like a rechargeable battery . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I dunno , that might contribute to less people losing it too if it it stays in one place . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN We have to think about um space in living-rooms , too , like 'cause they're I mean , would you put it on top of the T_V_ ? 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN I don't know , just think okay , that's that's a good idea , we'll keep it . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Think it's And maybe fun . 
UNKNOWN That's just off the top of my head . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um 'kay we're gonna conclude now , has everyone said their functions and 'kay . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN Um after the meeting we're gonna each complete a sks um a questionnaire and a summaries summary . 
UNKNOWN I don't know what summarisation . 
UNKNOWN Um and then we'll have our lunch break . 
UNKNOWN After that we have thirty minutes of individual work . 
UNKNOWN Um I'll make sure to put up um the minutesand the project documentationand including these PowerPointslides. 
UNKNOWN If everyone could do that as well , that'd be great . 
UNKNOWN Um you each have individual actions , I_ um I_D_ Industrial Design you've your components concept , User Interface , the user interface concept , market trend wa watching . 
UNKNOWN And as as per last time you'll get specific incrat instructions from your personal coach e-mailed to you . 
UNKNOWN And hopefully , I hope , next time you'll be able to access more of the web site that they they seem to tell you that you could . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , who knows . 
UNKNOWN It's kinda frustrating , but um Be sure to note any frustrations or any um issues that come up in your um in your um summary . 
UNKNOWN Okay Sounds good . 
UNKNOWN Mm 'kay ? 
UNKNOWN Great seeing y'all . 
UNKNOWN It's good . 
UNKNOWN Did you um were you able to like put yours in the group folder ? 
UNKNOWN Yes , I just did that . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Hopefully it is there for people . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN Yeah ? 
UNKNOWN Looks like there are um looks like there's a second one kind of of mine that's that I didn't do , it's from like an earlier project , I think so um Under the shared folder , I don't know it might not even be under yours as well . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Where is that ? 
UNKNOWN Yours is I only have three , I just have like our three . 
UNKNOWN Technical . 
UNKNOWN So in there we have technical functions presentation, working design presentationand the functional requirements . 
UNKNOWN Projects . 
UNKNOWN At least that's what I have in . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's what I have as well , R Rose So . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN You don't have mine ? 
UNKNOWN No , but that's 'cause I think yours is in the e-mail separate , like it's not on the server . 
UNKNOWN S Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But if I open it and then save it , probably will be there . 
UNKNOWN Oh wait , never mind you can't save it to the Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Well I'll figure that out in the meantime . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Mm yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN I g yeah . 
UNKNOWN Time is it ? 
UNKNOWN Fourteen twenty six . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Lovely to see you all again . 
UNKNOWN Um it's our conceptual design meeting and it's starting at approximately fourteen twenty five and so we have forty minutes for this one again and so we'll go just after three o'clock . 
UNKNOWN Um okay our agenda, we're gonna do an opening , I'm gonna review the minutesof the last meeting , then we'll have your three presentationsum and then we'll have to make a decision on the remote control concepts , and finally we'll close . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So opening . 
UNKNOWN Um these are our minutesfrom r the functional design . 
UNKNOWN We decided our target group is the focus on who can afford it , because we have international appeal and we said it's for all age groups , different um functions of it . 
UNKNOWN Our main objectives were simplicity and fashion . 
UNKNOWN And s um in specific functions are something to keep the remote from getting lost , large buttons for the essential functions , a possibility for extra functions , like a sliding a sliding piece and a long-life battery or a charging station . 
UNKNOWN Okay , now three presentations. 
UNKNOWN I'd like to do it in this order , first do the conceptual specification of components , properties and materials um and then the conceptual specification of user interface and finally trend watching . 
UNKNOWN That would be me . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
UNKNOWN Well . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN Function F_ eight it . 
UNKNOWN There we go . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
UNKNOWN Um I'm very excited by this one actually guys I uh had a lot of fun doing it . 
UNKNOWN Components design . 
UNKNOWN This is where you look at what does it take to make a remote control and what should we make our specific remote control out of . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN So , we need to examine each element separately , but we're designing a full thing , so you wanna keep it integrated as a whole . 
UNKNOWN The main elements of remote controls in general , and therefore ours as well , are the case , the buttons , the circuit board with the chip and the battery . 
UNKNOWN These are all things that we had sort of addressed before , but I'm gonna take each one a little bit separately here as we figure out what they should be made of and what they should look like . 
UNKNOWN The case , uh the options that I've gotten from headquarters about what we can do , um there's there's the shape of a case , we could do a flat sh a flat case , a curved case or maybe even a double double-curved case . 
UNKNOWN I haven't seen any pictures of what this exactly looks like yet , just keep that in mind , but these are the options that we have from manufacturing and we can make our case out of plastic , the m the main base will be plastic , but we have all these sort of fashion and technological elements we can add in , wood , latex , titanium , rubber or other coloured types of plastic . 
UNKNOWN That would be our case . 
UNKNOWN Um buttons , for buttons we have um pushbuttons , which is what Real Reaction uses the most often , but we also have scror scroll wheels , which can have integrated pushbuttons , or we could go all high-tech and have an L_ L_C_D_ screen . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Um circuit board and chip we can have a simple one , a regular one or an advanced one , depending on what our other needs are . 
UNKNOWN And then battery I think is where things get most exciting . 
UNKNOWN We're talking about long-life batteries here . 
UNKNOWN Um we can we can have your sort of basic double A_ batteries , but we also have these options of um using a kinetic battery , like are used in high-tech watches , where you just have to move it a little bit to get it to power up . 
UNKNOWN Um so simple movements like pushing buttons would recharge the battery . 
UNKNOWN Or a solar battery , although there are slight um complications with solar batteries as in we can't use a latex case if we have a solar battery . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Or um something they only described as the type of battery you find in torches from about fifty years ago , flashlights . 
UNKNOWN Not quite sure what that is , but that's the description that I received , so that's what I'm passing on to you . 
UNKNOWN So those are our options . 
UNKNOWN Um personal preferences that I was thinking through here's what we've been talking about all through , fashion and simplicity . 
UNKNOWN So if we're going for fashion in our cases , I think that what we're gonna wanna look at is a curved or a double-curved case , probably with a variety of design elements . 
UNKNOWN Maybe titanium , maybe some wood . 
UNKNOWN We're gonna have to investigate that better when I get specifics of the actual materials , but that's sort of what I have in mind . 
UNKNOWN And we wanna go for simplicity . 
UNKNOWN Probably pushbuttons , but I'm sort of intrigued by the idea of a scroll scroll wheel , if anyone has anything any ideas on that ? 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN I mean I know the iPods and things right now have touch scroll um buttons which are exactly like what they're describing , so that might be something we wanna look into . 
UNKNOWN And I'm really intrigued by the idea of a kinetic battery . 
UNKNOWN Solar I don't think would be such a good idea , because how often are you sure that your remote control will get a certain amount of light . 
UNKNOWN But this idea of the kinetic , that you don't have to replace , and that a simple just shaking it around will make it work , I think that that m would be a very interesting thing . 
UNKNOWN But I think we'd also wanna go for e a simple chip or regular chip to keep our costs down . 
UNKNOWN Uh we really only need a regular or advanced chip t if we're gonna start using an L_C_D_ . 
UNKNOWN So I think we want to be aware of not making things overly t technological if they don't need to be , 'cause that'll keep our manufacturing price way down . 
UNKNOWN That's what I have for options . 
UNKNOWN Um I'd appreciate anyone's input , but that's what I'm seeing for the future of the the look of this thing . 
UNKNOWN Is double-curved like would be like two hands kind of thing ? 
UNKNOWN I'm not sure . 
UNKNOWN I haven't received any specific visuals of this yet . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause I'm imagining like double-curved is like , you know , like two sides that curve and then like one curve would just be like a single vertical-ish kind of looking thing , but I've no idea . 
UNKNOWN This is what I'm sort of Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I'm not sure , but I'll let you know as soon as I get any pictures . 
UNKNOWN Sounds good . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I wonder Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN I know if we do have a double-curved case , it can't have any titanium in it . 
UNKNOWN But the titanium , they were quite they're marketing quite hard to us as being used in the space programme , so that could be quite interesting . 
UNKNOWN Space-age remote . 
UNKNOWN Just all things to keep in mind . 
UNKNOWN Just an interesting marketing kind of element . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN That's about all I have to do , guys . 
UNKNOWN I hope I didn't go through that too quickly . 
UNKNOWN Uh just a real quick question um the weight of these different elements , have you no idea , okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , n no idea , no idea . 
UNKNOWN Um I'm assuming that a kinetic battery isn't gonna take up that much weight , and that a tita titanium is very light , I know , um but other than that's really basic , I mean , that's all I have gotten so far . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Alright ? 
UNKNOWN Any other questions ? 
UNKNOWN Uh-huh . 
UNKNOWN Don't think so . 
UNKNOWN No ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Mm 'kay . 
UNKNOWN I have save this in the uh shared projects , if anyone wants to look and I have c considerable noteson the topic as well , if anyone needs any more information . 
THANKS Thank you , perfect . 
CONFIRMATION Thanks . 
UNKNOWN Uh Just in my notebook , but if anyone has any specific questions , don't hesitate to emailme or something . 
UNKNOWN Um if you made notesyourself you can put those on our um underneath our oh , uh in your book, then don't worry about that . 
UNKNOWN Alright ? 
UNKNOWN Uh I guess I can I know . 
UNKNOWN 'Kay now we're um concepts concepts of user interface . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , um . 
UNKNOWN This one's so much tighter than the other one . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Nope . 
UNKNOWN There we go . 
UNKNOWN Here you are . 
UNKNOWN Jess . 
UNKNOWN G oh , geez . 
UNKNOWN Alright , so I'm gonna describe the the concept of the user interface of this des device . 
UNKNOWN Um we've talked about uh the two essential properties of the user interface . 
UNKNOWN We want it to be simple and we want it to be fashionable . 
UNKNOWN Um other we've also got to remember that this is a device that serves as a useful purpose . 
UNKNOWN Uh we want people to be able to use it s as a remote control , so we need to determine what the essential functions of the d of the device are and make sure that we include that we've included all of those and that we actually end up with a device that is going to be useful to people . 
UNKNOWN We have a number of different choices for a design concept um and s that's that's something that that I'll show you some examples of um , but essentially we need to choose how how is this device going to work , how how what kind of model is there going to be for user interaction with this device . 
UNKNOWN Uh once we've chosen a a concept for it , we can then design the features around the concept , making sure that we get all the essential functions in the device and uh the extra functions and the more advanced features . 
UNKNOWN And of course we also have to make it look cool . 
UNKNOWN So basically , that's what we don't want . 
UNKNOWN M we don't want lots of buttons , uh complicated features . 
UNKNOWN We want something that looks nice and simple . 
UNKNOWN Here's a a fairly simple device . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN This is an an iPod from Apple . 
UNKNOWN Um I think the main thing to notice about it is it just has four buttons . 
UNKNOWN It's very minimalistic in its design . 
UNKNOWN Uh you use these four buttons to m to move around a range of settings on the small L_C_D_ screen . 
UNKNOWN Um the thing I like about this is that it's very very quick to access the main features . 
UNKNOWN Uh you can just about make out uh that the button three buttons are uh previous track , next track and play pause . 
UNKNOWN They're the main the main features of the iPod , the things you will use a all the time . 
UNKNOWN Um then if you want to do anything more advanced , you go into the little menu on the L_C_D_ screen and you use the buttons just to scroll around and and find the more advanced features that you want . 
UNKNOWN So I think that's that's a good a good kind of model that we could have . 
UNKNOWN Um here's a another example . 
UNKNOWN This is uh it's an interesting idea and I think i it looks pretty cool . 
UNKNOWN Um it's certainly got novelty value . 
UNKNOWN Uh it's nice and colourful , it's nice and bright . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Uh it's also something that you can kind of feel your way around . 
UNKNOWN The buttons are are different shapes and and you can sort of yeah if you're watching T_V_ in the dark or whatever , you can work out which button's which and basically , yeah it's ith it's fun . 
UNKNOWN So I I like I like this idea of just having buttons for the features that you use most often . 
UNKNOWN So you'd need a few buttons to select your favourite channels . 
UNKNOWN I mean most people , when they watch T_V_ , they have two hundred and fifty channels on their T_V_ and they watch of 'bout four of them at the most . 
UNKNOWN So , you have buttons for your favourite channel , changing the volume , which is something you do all the time when you're watching T_V_ , and the button to switch it off , in case you get bored . 
UNKNOWN Um other features , things like adjusting the brightness , tuning the T_V_ , uh I don't know what else you do with a T_V_ . 
UNKNOWN Um but these are these are all necessary functions . 
UNKNOWN Uh you can't have a t there's no point having a television that you can't tune or that you can't set the contrast , so we need to find a way of including these somehow . 
UNKNOWN Um and one other suggestions I'd make is to in is to include in a menu system , a bit like on the iPod . 
UNKNOWN So we'd either have a small L_C_D_ display on the device itself , or uh have a dis a menu display that comes up on your television and can b be controlled through the device . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN And that would allow you to access access the advanced features uh whilst keeping a very small and simple set of buttons for the features that you use most often . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So you'd be advocating an L_C_D_ then ? 
UNKNOWN I think that's that's one way to go , yes . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um I mean there are there are advantages and disadvantages if you if you have an L_C_D_ display , it's it's nice , because it's it it lets you just sort of sit there and st and control your television from your armchair . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN There are disadvantages , an an L_C_D_ display would have to be quite small , 'cause we're we're I well we're I assume we're gonna be making quite a small device . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Um it would also have to have uh a kind of backlighting in it , 'cause you ten you tend to watch T_V_ in the dark , but you need to be able to see your L_D_D_ L_C_D_ display . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN The alternative is to have a an on-screen display on your television that you control through your remote control . 
UNKNOWN Uh a bit like a bit like how they have these um digital boxes where you you press the buttons and it comes up with your this thing of watch lo what's on each channel . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN I mean that that's also a good idea . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN It's it can it does have it's problems as well , if you've got a small T_V_ and you're sitting on the other side of a room , it's hard to read the little text that comes up . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Uh but that's a that's a design decision that we can make . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN I do think that um one of the important features for a remote is seeing a menu and seeing what's on . 
UNKNOWN Um and so like favourite channels is is applicable , but I think th that you do need to have some kind of function where it's um you have t you can see the title of the show or possibly a description of it . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well Are you are you tak Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Like I I know I use that often enough . 
UNKNOWN Wait , but is that separate from what he was saying ? 
UNKNOWN Well if it if it was a L_ L_C_D_ on th on the remote , I don't know that you could f that you'd be able to see a Okay . 
UNKNOWN No , I think I think we're talking menu like contrast and tuning the V_C_R_ or something if I've understood you correctly , rather than menu as what's on . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that that would be one of the features , yes . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN But it's it's it's something to bear in mind is that if we put a display on the remote control the c uh communication is one way , so you can't have the televisions and information back to the remote control , at least I don't think you can . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause that would be more specifically a digital box , mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Oh , good point . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Um I'm not sure . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay , now we're moving on to market . 
UNKNOWN Should I plug that in ? 
UNKNOWN Marketing . 
UNKNOWN Is that going on ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Maybe it's just not Is it on ? 
UNKNOWN Uh that should be alright , actually . 
UNKNOWN Ri What F_ do you have to press , five ? 
UNKNOWN Eight . 
UNKNOWN I just keep pressing lots of 'em . 
UNKNOWN Well , I don't know how relevant all of this gonna be . 
UNKNOWN If anything , the that they gave me . 
UNKNOWN No signal . 
UNKNOWN Oops , it's not plugged in , quite in well enough . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
UNKNOWN There we are . 
UNKNOWN Oop , there we go . 
UNKNOWN Mm 'kay . 
UNKNOWN Oh yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so we're gonna look a little bit at trend watching . 
UNKNOWN Basically , I was given um an executive summary that was a market investigation on remote controls that was recently conducted , and then also some fashion watchers in Paris and Milan commented on some things that are gonna be going on this year . 
UNKNOWN So first um they had people they ranked um the important aspects of r remote controls , and right now i d they're saying that currently there's a functional look and feel preference , but that really , over the next year it it that's gonna be switching to fancy look and feel remotes , so that just goes back to the whole desire of our c Real Reaction company wanting to focus on fashion and so , even though we're stressing , when we're talking , we've all been talking about this like simplicity and easy to use idea , they're sort of wanting us to remember that the number one thing for everyone is that it's fancy look and feel . 
UNKNOWN And as these are ranked , the top one is doubly important to the second one , which is doubly important to the third one , so just to take that weight into account . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN The second thing that was mentioned as important was the technological innovations . 
UNKNOWN That would be like if we use something like the space material or the L_C_D_ screen , things like that . 
UNKNOWN And then ease of use was the third most important , whi so really , no matter what , we need to focus the most on fancy look and feel , according to this . 
UNKNOWN I don't know how much we agree with that . 
UNKNOWN And then the fashion watch talks about that this year's top trend for clothes , shoes and furniture is fruits and vegetables and tha that there's a preference for spongy , tight material . 
UNKNOWN S sweet . 
UNKNOWN And so that brings us to my personal preferences . 
UNKNOWN Who wants a spongy remote or one with fruit and vegetable padding . 
UNKNOWN Personally , I don't really think that I want one that's gonna go out of style or go stale , excuse the pun , um in a year , so even though this is coming from us as , you know , trend watch , market research , I don't know how much of it we necessarily wanna take away . 
UNKNOWN Also , considering that the d research b has been carried out by Real Reaction , I'm a little hesitant as to like , how these questions may have been worded , and if necessarily this whole fashion to technology y edas ease of use is necessarily the right ranking . 
UNKNOWN Personally , like I might reverse it , but if we're working for this company then I guess no matter what , we have to stress fashion the most . 
UNKNOWN But it doesn't necessarily need to be a spongy material . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN That there's all kinds of scope for imagination in that one though . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I don't have a lot of notesto share if you want them , that pretty much sums it up . 
UNKNOWN So yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay , do we have any s some questions for this , let's see um . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , what can I possibly enlighten on ? 
UNKNOWN Um do you have any ideas how to possibly use these ? 
UNKNOWN Um how to how to use a fruit or vegetable or um or the spongy material at all ? 
UNKNOWN Like could we make a s like could we make a spongy remote ? 
UNKNOWN It would be easier on the hands . 
UNKNOWN If it's latex if it's latexy Um , mean An uh I if th my understanding of a latex case is that it's in fact hard to protect stuff inside , but that it's covered with the latex , which is spongier and softer on your hands . 
UNKNOWN It's kind of and then it we would have to find a way to protect like the chip and all that , I dunno . 
UNKNOWN A kind of thing that Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN It's there's something to be said , I mean we we got that thing earlier from you about um not wanting it to R_ R_ repetitive stress injuries and things and and Yeah , something grippable , I mean we don't we don't we don't wanna go spongy , maybe . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , so something , m m instead of a necess yeah , grip , I'm thinking grip more than like sinking into your hands , you know , i and I think I'm envisioning more like , you know , the material that you have when you sit on like a bicycle , so that it doesn't hurt when you're sitting down for a long time , like I'm imagining that sort of thing , I don't know what th that material's called . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I think that given the list of materials I w I was forwarded it's that seems doable . 
UNKNOWN could we go in fruit and vegetable colours ? 
UNKNOWN We could colour-co-ordinate them , li The buttons could be fruit-shaped . 
UNKNOWN F for sure , or maybe like um couple main ones being like , I dunno , lemons or strawberries or something . 
UNKNOWN Could they be smelly ? 
UNKNOWN I Is it supposed to be shaped like a vegetable ? 
UNKNOWN Oh well it's quite easy to s shape thing like carrot isn't it ? 
UNKNOWN Oh God . 
UNKNOWN Uh like uh I dunno , like uh carrots or something . 
UNKNOWN I don't know . 
UNKNOWN Or carrot shaped , mm . 
UNKNOWN Maybe , or Kind of like a potato . 
UNKNOWN Or maybe the buttons could be shaped like different fruits . 
UNKNOWN Like large button , that's what I was thinking of , yeah . 
UNKNOWN What about the idea of like a round remote ? 
UNKNOWN Instead of like a vertical up and down one . 
UNKNOWN Like in terms of holding it . 
UNKNOWN Like that's a f shape of a fruit . 
UNKNOWN be yeah . 
UNKNOWN It'd be harder to f bu uh buttons I think . 
UNKNOWN Just to tie it in a little . 
UNKNOWN Might would you think you you do you think you'd be able to hold it ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause I think the reason they're long is yeah . 
UNKNOWN It'd be harder to press button . 
UNKNOWN Depends . 
UNKNOWN Harder to push . 
UNKNOWN When you when you use a remote , do you press the buttons with your thumb , usually ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Or your fingers ? 
UNKNOWN Um I Yeah , that's ts how I tend to do it . 
UNKNOWN I usually hold it in one hand . 
UNKNOWN Maybe But then the buttons would have to be very small . 
UNKNOWN Or maybe you want something that's shaped like a mobile phone , so you you hold it in one hand , and you press the buttons with your thumb . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , 'cause otherwise your fingers can't move around . 
UNKNOWN Don't you think ? 
UNKNOWN No just thumb-sized . 
UNKNOWN Jus Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But I like i I love the idea of the wheel like the iPod . 
UNKNOWN But I mean in order to get to all of them , you know . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN They would have to be within a certain amount of space with each other . 
CONFUSION Maybe . 
UNKNOWN That's true . 
UNKNOWN But if you've only got like four or five buttons anyway , then it's it's not so much a problem , perhaps . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN I When I'm when I'm pressing buttons on my iPod , that's how I do it , hold it and press the four . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So you hold it in one hand and you press you press the buttons with your thumb and And you find that works quite well ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , or in and use my thumb or my pointer finger on the touch scroll wheel . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah It wel well yeah , it would I mean each version of it has been a little bit different , but Oh yeah , you had one of the in-between ones , when they weren't doing that anymore . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Is that The button on an iPod , is it what is it , is it just four buttons or is it li more like a scroll thing ? 
UNKNOWN 'Cause th It's like five , 'cause there's one in the middle . 
UNKNOWN It's a scroll , yeah , it's a wheel . 
UNKNOWN The one I have doesn't have the four on i like around it , I don't think . 
UNKNOWN Ts and you press the centre button , that's that's your all-purpose select button right there . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Oh , I see , right , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Oh , okay . 
UNKNOWN Since it's the one in the centre that's not marked , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's quite a good design . 
UNKNOWN I think why it would be good for us is 'cause like you could have the same wheel sort of effect for like channel flipping and then the other one could be like for volume . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Like just the idea of like those so few buttons for main things , but then how you could go back to the menu and like , I dunno if we would want it on the screen there or on the actual T_V_ . 
UNKNOWN Uh uh t Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I kind of am wanting to say on the T_V_ , 'cause if you're changing the brightness , don't you wanna see it happening , kind of ? 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And then you could still have that available . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I think an L_C_D_ screen might be good in theory , but not as useful in practice . 
UNKNOWN I think it could be difficult in practice , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Also z yeah , 'cause you would be z looking down at the L_C_D_ screen , than back up at your T_V_ and people don't wanna do that . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um Oh we probably have to get going , don't we ? 
UNKNOWN Okay um we have we've about fifteen minutes left , so I'm I'm gonna continue with my pres presentation. 
UNKNOWN Uh-huh . 
UNKNOWN Um I've one more slidebefore we close , but in that slideis when we need to make decisions about this these kinds of things , so I'll just bring that up and show you all before we move on . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN Um Yeah , and then like the the covers could be spongy latex wherea but the actual model could be titanium . 
UNKNOWN If I get any more information of fruits and vegetables , I'll let you know . 
UNKNOWN Could Could we uh could we have changeable covers like for your mobile ? 
UNKNOWN Like , to make it different fruits . 
UNKNOWN In different fruit and vegetable colours , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , it's possible . 
UNKNOWN Exactly . 
UNKNOWN And you could co-ordinate with your house or whatever . 
UNKNOWN I think maybe th the packaging , it should be like a lemon and the the packaging is like the peel . 
UNKNOWN All these options . 
UNKNOWN So instead of opening the box you just kind of peel it , and the remote control's inside . 
UNKNOWN Ooh . 
UNKNOWN Well , there we go . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN Don't know . 
UNKNOWN Ah hmm hmm hmm . 
UNKNOWN The iPod packaging is me like was so that was like half the fun . 
UNKNOWN It's like the way it all comes all cute . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Lemons ? 
UNKNOWN Options . 
UNKNOWN Okay , um components concept . 
UNKNOWN Energy , chip on print. 
UNKNOWN Uh-hu oh , oh yes . 
UNKNOWN Right , I had sort of skipped over that hoping it wouldn't get be necessary but um Alright , so um decisions , what the okay deci decisions on energy I'm thinking is based on the battery . 
UNKNOWN G That's th th this is the agendathey gave me . 
UNKNOWN So can you just explain what that is real quick ? 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um I dunno , what do people think about this kinetic battery idea ? 
UNKNOWN I think it's awesome . 
UNKNOWN I think it's really cool . 
UNKNOWN Am I Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I mean , it would t totally take care of our problem of not wanting to change batteries . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , um I think it's good , as as long as we consider the the cost and the uh how reliable it is , but as far as I know , the technology is good . 
UNKNOWN Right , I haven't gotten any yeah , any more information on cost other than it's more expensive than a regular battery , but um but if we're using a an i a cheaper chip , then it'll even out , I think . 
UNKNOWN Costs . 
UNKNOWN But over time Yeah , it's a But if you c if you could scroll through the channels , and then the volume would just be and the volume would just be like the same way , forward and backward as I'm just thinking like it would make it much like sleeker sort of looking . 
UNKNOWN Um circuit boards . 
UNKNOWN Um yeah , I got a whole bunch of information on how circuit boards are produced . 
UNKNOWN They're they're thin fibreglass with copper wires etched on to them , and di I think they're quite easily printed on by machine , which is chip on printis where the machine prints on the wires and solders it all together for us . 
UNKNOWN I don't really know what to tell you as far as decisions . 
UNKNOWN I wasn't really given any options , I was just given that this is how they're done . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um yeah , I can't can't really tell you . 
UNKNOWN I can I can tell you a whole lot about how it works . 
UNKNOWN But I don't know any decisions on Yeah . 
UNKNOWN If they're if they're really options . 
UNKNOWN I'm sorry , I did f Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Al all circuit boards are pretty much the same , I think . 
UNKNOWN Uh it's fairly fairly standard . 
UNKNOWN Um okay , then we'll move on to the case . 
UNKNOWN Um oh bu I guess maybe if we decided on like a simple , a regular , or an advanced chip , maybe . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Well okay , here's the here's the thing on the chips that I that I got . 
UNKNOWN Um simple , regular , advanced chip on print. 
UNKNOWN The chip on printincludes an infrared sensor , so we don't have to worry about that . 
UNKNOWN Um , 'kay , the pushbutton if we're gonna have pushbuttons , they require a simple chip , but a scroll wheel requires a regular chip , and an L_C_D_ requires advanced . 
UNKNOWN Do we want a scroll wheel , or do we just want pushbuttons ? 
UNKNOWN Um I don't think we ne really need the scroll whe wheel . 
UNKNOWN I mean it might be nice for changing the volume . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN It would be nice for changing the volume , but I don't know how useful it'd be for changing the channel . 
UNKNOWN Uh but I don't think it would really work . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause you don't have control over numbers or We have five minutes left for the meeting , so . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , you really need buttons for changing a channel . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , th it'd be it'd be handy for going through if there was an on-screen menu of your channel choices , than you can scroll down on the scroll . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And otherwise , no matter how may buttons we have , we're gonna have like , you know , black with red sticking out and th no it's gonna inevitably sort of start looking like those group of sort of ugly ones that we saw stacked up . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN So , have a scroll for volume ? 
UNKNOWN F or for all those secret functions ? 
UNKNOWN F Um . 
UNKNOWN When you get on the on-screen menu of all your functions that your remote could do for you without the buttons and you could have a scroll wheel to go through those menus . 
UNKNOWN I think yeah , I think a scroll wheel would be nice , but it's not necessary . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Um Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So we could either go with a simple or a regular chip , depending and maybe we could table that decision for later . 
UNKNOWN I don't know . 
UNKNOWN I think w well I think when we go on to the une userface , we're gonna have to decide the interface we're gonna have to decide um whether we're gonna have a scroll or not . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Well , let's think about that while we talk about the case . 
UNKNOWN Okay , let's do case . 
UNKNOWN Uh I'm kinda liking the idea of latex , if if spongy is the in thing . 
UNKNOWN I'm a little um I'm a little hesitant about it , because I'm worried about protecting the stuff on the inside . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um Yeah , I would be more okay with like a titanium actual thing and then maybe like a mobile phone kind of thing . 
UNKNOWN Oh could it be hard , and then something around it ? 
UNKNOWN Uh yeah , everything I've N oh wha what I've what I've seen , just not related to this , but of latex cases before , is that there's uh like a hard plastic inside , and it's just covered with the latex . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Not too thick a layer of latex , just enough to be grippable , like bike handles or or anything that you've seen like that . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN The inside is hard . 
UNKNOWN I don't think we need to worry about protecting the circuit board , I think that that's done for us . 
UNKNOWN Ge o Okay . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So we uh we do want latex . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Latex . 
UNKNOWN Um and probably in colours , maybe fruity , vegetable colours . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Fruity colours . 
UNKNOWN Okay um let's go to the ufe user interface then we'll come back to the chip I suppose . 
UNKNOWN Oh and we want a curved case , yeah ? 
UNKNOWN Or a double-curved ? 
UNKNOWN Well , we don't really know what the difference is , right ? 
UNKNOWN I'm thinking curved of some sort . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN We don't really know what the difference Good point . 
UNKNOWN Um okay , interface , the type and the supplements . 
UNKNOWN So push or scroll , right ? 
UNKNOWN Um Yep . 
UNKNOWN Or both ? 
UNKNOWN Um And I think if we wanna keep our costs down , we should just go for pushbuttons , 'cause then we can have a a simple chip and it's simpler , it's it's cheaper to make pushbuttons than it is a scroll button . 
UNKNOWN So in terms of uh in terms of uh economics it's probably better to have pushbuttons . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN And if we had a sc an on-screen um kind of thing that you could scroll through , like you can use your buttons to scroll through things . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah , it's uh it's it's fairly simple . 
UNKNOWN I think that yeah . 
UNKNOWN For channel surfing I think a scroll an actual like an iPod's kind of scroll thing would be too fast , I dunno . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I say pushbuttons at least unless we get any information but I have no idea how much more expensive a scroll wheel is than than a pushbutton , but it's gotta be some more expensive , so I think it might be better to put our money into the stuff like the kinetic battery and the cool case because Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Is that okay with you ? 
UNKNOWN Interesting . 
UNKNOWN How you feeling ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And let's like see if we get anything else . 
UNKNOWN I mean I'm not like hard-sold on the scroll wheel , it's more just to give it a different kind of look , but if it's gonna be in a latex type thing and that's gonna look cool , then that's probably gonna have a bigger impact than the scroll wheel . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN It might be cool enough . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so we're gonna go with um type pushbuttons , and then supplements , how are we gonna do that ? 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN Uh what do you mean by supplements , exactly ? 
UNKNOWN Um I assume that's what else we're gonna like h ha the um the additional buttons we can use . 
UNKNOWN Um Yep . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN So we're gonna have like a menu button , so that we can access on-screen things then ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay , um so we're doing an on-screen menu that we can scroll through . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
UNKNOWN Um in Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So what are what are our buttons gonna be ? 
UNKNOWN On off So like one through five , or No . 
UNKNOWN On off , uh volume , favourite channels , uh and menu . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah about yeah like yeah , a bit like radio presets . 
UNKNOWN Like a radio type sorta situation ? 
UNKNOWN Um Uh we wouldn't even need the numbers . 
UNKNOWN Pre-set channels and then we're gonna need um numbers one through zero , right ? 
UNKNOWN I think maybe numbers seems is kind of old-fashioned . 
UNKNOWN Well , but in order to pre-set a cha oh I guess you can just hold it down when you get to one when you're scrolling through . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah , you can just and you need some kind of , I dunno , sort of up down kind of button , but the volume control could double for that , for example . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , up down . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Okay , um finishing the meeting now . 
UNKNOWN Um our next meeting starts in thirty minutes , um you each have things to do , look and feel design , user interface design , product evaluation , and you two are going to work together on a prototype using modelling clay . 
UNKNOWN You'll get specific instructions from your personal coach . 
UNKNOWN Ooh . 
CONFIRMATION Cool . 
UNKNOWN Wow . 
UNKNOWN Um did we decide on a chip ? 
UNKNOWN Let's go with a simple chip ? 
UNKNOWN Simple chip . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN We are done . 
THANKS Thank you everyone . 
UNKNOWN Oh I di these are already in our shared folder , so . 
CONFIRMATION Okay , cool . 
UNKNOWN Clay . 
UNKNOWN Clay . 
UNKNOWN I wasn't expecting that . 
UNKNOWN Okay um , welcome to our detailed design meeting . 
UNKNOWN I'm pretty excited . 
UNKNOWN Let's start it's approximately fifteen forty or something like that . 
UNKNOWN Okay um the agendawe're gonna do an opening and then um I'll talk about the minutesfrom the last meeting , what we d discussed um , then we'll have the prototype presentationand a look at the evaluation criteria . 
UNKNOWN We'll look at the finances and finally a do a production evaluation and close . 
UNKNOWN So , starting off with the um last the last one , oh I don't have it here um , but we talked about energy , we're gonna use a kinetic battery um , we want to use a simple chip , because we're not gonna need a a shuffle um , we're gonna need a scroll um , we're choosing a latex case w in fruity colours that's curved and um we're using push buttons uh with a supplement of an on-screen menu . 
UNKNOWN And it sounded like we had set um like eight or nine buttons , including five pre-set channels . 
UNKNOWN Okay ? 
UNKNOWN Let's do the look and feel design presentationfirst . 
UNKNOWN Right , do you wanna start ? 
UNKNOWN Right , well we made three different prototypes and I guess we'll start with with this one . 
UNKNOWN Um we have our colours not are not fixed , but this is the general shape . 
UNKNOWN Um it's you hold it sort of either like like this in your left hand or you switch it over and uh it's easily adaptable to either hand . 
UNKNOWN You can push the buttons with your thumb like a mobile phone , or you can push them with your index finger of your other hand , or even I mean there's a whole variety , you can hold it like this and press it with your same index finger . 
UNKNOWN Uh we have the on off button at the tip , very visible , very big . 
UNKNOWN We have our up and down buttons , which are also gonna be our channel selectors , and we have our little menu button here . 
UNKNOWN If you push if you're just pushing these normally , they're the menu buttons , if uh the volume buttons rather . 
UNKNOWN If you press select once , they become channel changing buttons . 
UNKNOWN If we press select three times , the menu with the other features and pro possibly also with your T_V_ channel choices shows up , and you have your five presets down here . 
UNKNOWN Um if people wanna grab hold of that , see how it feels in your hand . 
UNKNOWN That's our number one prototype . 
UNKNOWN Um do you wanna present the potato , or shall I present the Martian ? 
UNKNOWN like a little lightning in it . 
UNKNOWN Okay , um What We call that one the rhombus , uh the rhombus . 
UNKNOWN The little lightning bolt in it , very cute . 
UNKNOWN I could Could the middle button of the on-screen menu function as a power button ? 
UNKNOWN The v the rhombus rhombus ? 
UNKNOWN That's the rhombus , yep . 
UNKNOWN Um this one is known as the potato , uh it's it's a how can I present it ? 
UNKNOWN It's an ergonomic shape , so it it fits in your hand nicely . 
UNKNOWN Um it's designed to be used either in your left hand or or in your right hand . 
UNKNOWN Um I've gone here just for just for four buttons on this one . 
UNKNOWN Um the two blue buttons here are for adjusting the volume . 
UNKNOWN So you've got volume up and volume down on the other side here . 
UNKNOWN Um the red ones are for uh changing channels , channel up and channel down and that's um moves between your favourite channels that you've selected . 
UNKNOWN Uh this middle button here brings up the on-screen menu and when you're working in the on-screen menu you use the other four buttons to navigate around the menu system and the middle button uh to select and that's basically it , that's the potato . 
UNKNOWN Um on , off ? 
UNKNOWN Uh that would be one of your channels , basically , so like channel zero would be t to switch switch the machine off , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah we turn it off . 
UNKNOWN Um not really , it would make it hard to turn the machine off , to turn your T_V_ off . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN If you pressed and held it maybe . 
UNKNOWN Yeah yeah , that that'd be one way of doing it , yeah . 
UNKNOWN If you like held it down , that would be on off . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN That'd work , yeah . 
UNKNOWN On off , that's a possibility , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN And then finally we have um the Martian or the pear , either way . 
UNKNOWN Um it's a bit different , just a little bit more of a creative feel . 
UNKNOWN Uh you have the on off toggle stem on the top . 
UNKNOWN We have the five preset seeds . 
UNKNOWN And then you have on the sides to make it a little bit more three-dimensional , you have your channel changing , volume changing buttons and your menu button right here in the middle . 
UNKNOWN So , that's for your consideration as well , plus it's an interesting talking point to have standing up . 
UNKNOWN Let's pass . 
UNKNOWN We figured it could stand up like this on your table , if you wanted it to , if I made the bot the bottom flat . 
UNKNOWN Uh-huh . 
UNKNOWN Sorry , what's the yellow one in the middle , I forgot . 
UNKNOWN Uh the menu select button . 
UNKNOWN Very interesting . 
UNKNOWN I think that one's my favourite . 
UNKNOWN So that's So that's our three prototypes . 
UNKNOWN Um basically , in terms of making decisions , what we'd need to do is first of all decide on a form uh which of the three different shapes we want , then decide what kind of button layoutwe want , how many buttons , and then to choose what colours we want to make the buttons and if we wanna put any text on the device , like label on the buttons or put a brand name or or a logo on it or whatever . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN We were we were thinking that normally we'd go for fruity colours , but maybe we're also thinking that your sort of middle aged man , for an example customer , might not want a fruity coloured remote , so m maybe we'd have one version that's a bit toned down , maybe with with less contrasts on it . 
UNKNOWN Mm 'kay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , something still a little bright to make it hard to lose , but yeah . 
UNKNOWN Would Yeah , but we don't want it to look like a kids' toy . 
UNKNOWN Now that was one thing that we brought up over email. 
UNKNOWN I don't know if you picked up your email, but um the f the um feature that we considered for it not getting lost . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Well we were we were talking about that a little bit when we got that emailand we think that each of these are so distinctive , that it it's not just like another piece of technology around your house . 
UNKNOWN It's gonna be somewhere that it can be seen . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So we're we're not thinking that it's gonna be as critical to have the loss I think Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But if it's like under covers or like in a couch you still can't see it . 
UNKNOWN It's really Would it be very difficult to um just have an external device that like I dunno , you tape to your to your T_V_ um that when you press it you ha a little light beep goes off ? 
UNKNOWN Do you think that would be conceptually possible ? 
UNKNOWN I think it would be difficult technologically , because if your if your remote's lost it's probably under the settee and in that case you can't you can't send an infrared sing signal to it to find it , s so it's I'm not quite sure how it would work and then I wonder if it's if it's more just a gimmick then anything else . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN That's true , mm 'kay . 
UNKNOWN Uh I mean ho how many times do you really , seriously lose your remote control and would would a device like that actually help you to find it ? 
UNKNOWN There might be something that you can do in the circuit board and the chip to make it make a noise or something , but it would take a lot more development than we have this afternoon . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Okay , that's a fair evaluation . 
UNKNOWN Getting lost . 
UNKNOWN Um we so we do we've decided not to worry about that for now . 
UNKNOWN Okay 'cause well , the designsare very bright , so you're right , they're gonna stick out , but um Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So d do people have a preference as far as feel and functionality ? 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN I feel like this is simil or it's sort of what already exists so if we're trying to think of something sort of like new and fun , even though this is like what you're init I'm initially drawn to , just 'cause it's like comfortable and like not different . 
UNKNOWN I sort of like this one , like I I don't know why , it just it's like small but still sort of like cute looking , I dunno . 
UNKNOWN But I also like the b the side buttons on that one , like I think that's kind of neat . 
UNKNOWN But I dunno how much any of this has to do with the fashionable , sort of cool looking thing that we also need to focus on . 
UNKNOWN Could we maybe have like an extra button on the top for on off ? 
UNKNOWN So then w we wouldn't have to have like a dual function ? 
UNKNOWN Mm yeah , that's good , that's good . 
UNKNOWN Ah , there we go . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , it's possible , yeah , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Here , stick it on . 
UNKNOWN Put an extra the button on . 
CONFIRMATION Sure . 
UNKNOWN Um uh why don't we do a product evaluation using your criteria , if you've developed some ? 
UNKNOWN Well do we w like I think we're supposed to have one that we do it for . 
UNKNOWN Oh okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN That was I was a little vague on what exactly I'm supposed to do , but let me I have to like write something on the whiteboard , so . 
UNKNOWN So where Right . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Do you need this or just write on the white board ? 
UNKNOWN No , I actually don't have like a PowerPointy thing , 'cause I think it would be redundant . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN I dunno . 
UNKNOWN It's kind of like uh like a joystick kind of thing , you know , kinda push it . 
UNKNOWN Ooh . 
CONFIRMATION Cool . 
UNKNOWN Hey . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN Maybe a little smaller than that . 
UNKNOWN No , I kinda like it . 
UNKNOWN That's hard to miss . 
UNKNOWN It makes look more fruity as well . 
UNKNOWN Oh it does , it's kind of like There it could have a stem like that , 'cause I do l kind of like the stem . 
UNKNOWN It's like a deformed foot , I dunno . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Like Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It almost helps you ge keep a grip too , 'cause it goes in between fingers . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Interesting . 
UNKNOWN I like this one . 
UNKNOWN Okay , is that where people are leaning then , the potato ? 
UNKNOWN Variety of colours are nice . 
UNKNOWN I like the idea of the I mean that's really gotten the simplicity of the buttons down , that one . 
UNKNOWN I think I'm leaning towards the potato . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN I am worried about like um using a menu . 
UNKNOWN Um in that like i withing menus there are submenus , and so how do you get back to the main menu ? 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well that on the iPod , for example , you just every time you wanna go back you hit the menu button again and it brings you back one level . 
UNKNOWN But that has a menu button separate from a select button , whereas if this one's both the menu and the select button ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Good point . 
UNKNOWN This is , it's the up and down buttons are used for scrolling up and down for a list of choices . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN You find the choice that you want and you press uh you press the right button uh . 
UNKNOWN Could these be used for going to submenus or Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , so they're used for going into and out of your submenus , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Maybe yeah , maybe it can be one of those , if you press down and hold for two seconds , then it brings you back one level or something . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Well , as long as we have that in mind as we're designing it still , mm 'kay . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so which one are we sort of roughly looking at to address whether or not it meets our s um necessities , the yellowy one is that Okay , well we can obviously change it after we go through each different one . 
UNKNOWN The potato ? 
UNKNOWN Are we leaning towards the potato ? 
UNKNOWN Potato . 
UNKNOWN I think so . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So basically what we need to do is some of the things that we've talked about before we need to make sure that that remote actually does conform to the things that we said it was going to . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So what we sort of wanna do is that we each need to separately rank each of the following things and then I'll tabulate an average just to make sure that it does meet that . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So we'll just go through them one at a time and we'll just go around and each of you can tell me on a scale of one to seven with one being really extremely true and seven being not true at all , or false , if the remote that we've created conforms to the following criteria . 
UNKNOWN So we can do this one first . 
UNKNOWN First we wanna know if it meets the fancy look and feel um objective . 
UNKNOWN So like in my opinion the for now at least , the yellow one is probably somewhere in the middle so I'm gonna say it's like a three . 
UNKNOWN That's just my opinion . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN What does each of you Okay , well give it a number , sorry . 
UNKNOWN I I kind of think it's it's unique enough that I'd give it a one or a two . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN I will give it a one . 
UNKNOWN Um I dunno if it's it's creative . 
UNKNOWN I dunno if fancy is the word I would use . 
UNKNOWN I dunno if any of them are fancy in I'd say two , because c unique . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN And two , awesome . 
UNKNOWN I'll go for two . 
UNKNOWN Alright , and same sort of scale for functionality , is it functional ? 
UNKNOWN I think it's extremely functional , I'm gonna give it a one . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , one . 
UNKNOWN One ? 
UNKNOWN I think it's it's functional , it's also pretty basic , so I'll give it a two . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um functional . 
UNKNOWN I think it'll get everything done , I think it might be a little confusing at first , um , I don't know if that's gonna be a later one . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Well there's some other ones , I will address that , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay , then I'm gonna give it a two . 
UNKNOWN Awesome , okay . 
UNKNOWN Um we wanna know next if it's technologically innovative . 
UNKNOWN Did you give a functional ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , she said it was one . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um is it technologically innovative ? 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Not really , I mean not so much , 'cause we we don't have the L_C_D_ screen , we don't have fancy chip . 
UNKNOWN Other than what it looks like , I dunno if it's really I kinetic battery is a big one , so . 
UNKNOWN Well , the kinetic battery . 
UNKNOWN In the battery , that's it . 
UNKNOWN How many people would notice that , though ? 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN But it but we know it's there . 
UNKNOWN But they'll notice it after like a year , they'll be like hey , I have never changed the battery . 
UNKNOWN And if it's made of like latex , that whole idea , that's pretty cool . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN I'll give it a three . 
UNKNOWN Just the material . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause it we could've picked a lot of features that would've made it really Alright . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I I would say that it's Yeah , like fancy versus creative it's it's different . 
UNKNOWN But does that equal innovative ? 
UNKNOWN I dunno . 
UNKNOWN I'll give it a three . 
UNKNOWN Everyone else ? 
UNKNOWN I'd say it's technologically it's not it's not unique , I mean it's it's just it is just pushbuttons um , so I I'd give it a four . 
UNKNOWN Think I'm gonna go with the four as well . 
UNKNOWN Mm 'kay . 
UNKNOWN I really like that kinetic battery though . 
UNKNOWN Next , is it easy to use ? 
UNKNOWN Just so you know , easy to learn will be separate , so don't overlap them . 
UNKNOWN Mm 'kay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN I think it's really easy to use . 
UNKNOWN I'll give it a two . 
UNKNOWN Um I'll give it a one . 
UNKNOWN Pretty hard to mess up . 
UNKNOWN I'll say one . 
UNKNOWN Uh let's say two . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
UNKNOWN Um we next wanna see if it has a spongy quality and if indeed it's made of latex or rubber I it's spongy all the way . 
UNKNOWN Give it a one . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I wonder if it bounces when you drop it . 
UNKNOWN Ooh , that you couldn't it'd be harder to break , harder to lose . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause there would be less impact maybe , . 
UNKNOWN Iain , what do you give it ? 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah I'd I'd give it a one . 
UNKNOWN Alright and the next is , does it integrate some notion of fruits and vegetables ? 
CONFUSION Uh um . 
UNKNOWN Well , is it gonna be yellow ? 
UNKNOWN It it might be , 'cause that's our corporate colour , isn't it ? 
UNKNOWN That's right , yeah , corporate colour , we didn't keep that in um well if we I know it would make it a little less c a little more confusing , but if we had all the buttons in black , and a design in and the outside in yellow , that'd be our corporate one and we could also have alternative colours , one a more conservative one , one that's more fruity . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN We might wanna keep it yellow . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but if you had like a silvery kind of white or something . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um and can we have like an R_R_ inscribed on the bottom or something ? 
UNKNOWN If we had a yellow Sure . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Oh , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Alright , so I think it it's Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Fruity , so fruity . 
UNKNOWN So it was inspired by the potato , so I think it's pretty fruity . 
UNKNOWN I think i it's kind of mangoey too . 
UNKNOWN Oh , mango that that That's a much more trendy than a potato one . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Mangoey is better , yeah . 
UNKNOWN I okay , I'm giving it a one the mango put me over . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN I like mangoes . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN What are what's everyone's numbers ? 
UNKNOWN Uh two . 
UNKNOWN One . 
UNKNOWN Alright um , and does the design match the appropriate behaviour ? 
UNKNOWN Remember earlier we discussed that people don't use a lot of buttons , that they use the channel flipping and the volume the most . 
UNKNOWN I think we really took that into account a lot , so I'm gonna give it a one . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , me too . 
UNKNOWN Uh one . 
UNKNOWN Did you say one , Rose ? 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN Okay um , also we talked earlier about R_S_I_ and wanting to prevent um any sort of like Carpal Tunnely kind of thing . 
UNKNOWN Do we think that the latex sort of grip appropriately takes that into account ? 
UNKNOWN I think I'll give it a two , 'cause I almost feel like no matter what you do , something is gonna happen . 
UNKNOWN It's gonna be hard . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah . 
UNKNOWN And if it's repetitive movement it is gonna be only four buttons that you're constantly pushing , but um I like how it fits in the hand though so I I'd go with a two . 
UNKNOWN Um um worth the risk , I think . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I'll I'll say two as well . 
UNKNOWN Because older people that aren't used to like texting with the thumb might find it a bit at first , but The menu system and the the fact that multiple buttons are used for different things might be a bit confusing , but I think if it's one it's one of those things that it might take you five minutes to figure out , but you'll have it afterwards . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah I'll I'll say two . 
UNKNOWN Alright , awesome . 
UNKNOWN And the ease of learning it . 
UNKNOWN I know you were saying that you're a little bit nervous about that , I dunno . 
UNKNOWN It sort of reminds me of the iPod . 
UNKNOWN I just got mine , I still haven't read the instruction bookand I'm doing okay , so and I'm not good at learning technology . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN So I'll give it a two . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So I'd I think I'd give it a two I guess . 
UNKNOWN I think it it's probably a little harder then most remotes to learn , because you have to you have to use the menu system and you have to tell it what your favourite channels are and that could take a bit of learning at first , but once you've , yeah once you'd learned how to use it , I think it is a lot easier . 
UNKNOWN Oh , good point . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So I'd I'd give it a four . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN I think I'd give it a four too . 
UNKNOWN It's a pretty high learning curve , it'll be easy once you've done it , but We we I think we can kind of say we addressed it with colour , but Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Alright , um also earlier we had something about losing it and so now we're not addressing that at all , so Okay , so in terms of not losing it , do you think that on a scale of one to seven , how easy or hard is it to lose ? 
UNKNOWN I'm gonna I'm gonna give it a four , 'cause I think that you can still if it's in between somewhere where you can't see it , you're kind of not gonna find it , but anywhere else it's gonna stand out . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um I'd say I'd give it uh a three , I guess it depends on how tidy you are normally . 
UNKNOWN Mm I'd give it a four . 
UNKNOWN Um I'll give it a five 'cause i it would be easy to lose something like that , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Small too . 
UNKNOWN Alright , we also said simplicity , how w how well does it address just being simple ? 
UNKNOWN Simple to use or simple in design ? 
UNKNOWN Do you know ? 
UNKNOWN I think overall , 'cause we had said before our two main things were simplicity and fashion , so those are the next two things we're gonna look at . 
UNKNOWN Separate from fancy , like that sort of thing . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Um it like wants to be simple but it's not like totally totally simple , so I'm gonna give it a two . 
UNKNOWN I'm give it a three I guess . 
UNKNOWN I'll give it a two . 
UNKNOWN Three . 
UNKNOWN Alright , and fashionable ? 
UNKNOWN It's totally fashionable . 
UNKNOWN It's hot , I mean it's a mango , come on . 
UNKNOWN I'd give it a one . 
UNKNOWN Mango . 
UNKNOWN I mean how fashionable can you make a remote ? 
UNKNOWN I think it's bringing technology and fashion together real really well . 
UNKNOWN I dunno . 
UNKNOWN I don't think it's quite as fashionable as my robot remote or alien or whatever he was . 
UNKNOWN I do like uh the little Martian one . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , the toggle on off switch , it's really appealing . 
UNKNOWN Number . 
UNKNOWN Um two . 
UNKNOWN Three . 
UNKNOWN One . 
UNKNOWN And does it meet our like demographic need sort of for international appeal , that whole thing ? 
UNKNOWN Just that it would se serve our audience . 
UNKNOWN I don't see why not . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN I think as long if we offer in a in at least three different colour arrangements . 
UNKNOWN Um yeah , that's good . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So I'll give it a a two . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I'll say two . 
UNKNOWN Alright , did anyone have any other features that they think were important that we didn't talk about ? 
UNKNOWN Well um we didn't we didn't address the fact that it does need to b have a corporate logo , so let's let's make sure we keep that in mind that we ha that one of our colours concepts is corporate and has an R_R_ on it . 
UNKNOWN Shall we uh Well I think all of them should have an R_R_ . 
UNKNOWN All of them should have R_R_ , yeah . 
UNKNOWN And so we're gonna do that , so it will address it , fine . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Mm 'kay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN That's me . 
CONFIRMATION Lovely . 
UNKNOWN Okay , now we're gonna look at finances . 
UNKNOWN Um I have an Excel sheetthat we're actually gonna calculate the cost um , so let me exit out of this first . 
UNKNOWN Okay um I know . 
UNKNOWN Whoa . 
UNKNOWN Oh my . 
UNKNOWN Let me one more space . 
UNKNOWN Gonna zoom in real quick . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Hand dynamo . 
UNKNOWN We're using kinetic battery , right ? 
UNKNOWN Uh we're n using kinetic , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um and we're having one per One , okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um electronics . 
UNKNOWN Single . 
UNKNOWN Simple , simple rather . 
UNKNOWN Simple . 
UNKNOWN Simple . 
UNKNOWN Mm 'kay . 
UNKNOWN Um the case . 
UNKNOWN Uh uh uh double-curved . 
UNKNOWN Guess it's double-curved . 
UNKNOWN It is pretty curvy . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It's very curvy , so okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah I never did get a picture of those so I don't really know . 
UNKNOWN Our case material supplements oops , we just skipped by them . 
UNKNOWN Well don't we need plastic , and Provided , okay . 
UNKNOWN No , we we the plastic is the plastic for the inside is assumed . 
UNKNOWN The supplement is Oh , I guess it was rubber rather than latex . 
UNKNOWN The wood ? 
UNKNOWN I mean the rubber . 
UNKNOWN It was rubber and special colour , right ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm , okay . 
UNKNOWN Do we have more than one special colour ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , we're using we're gonna need at least two special colours . 
UNKNOWN Uh well I don't know what the se the basic colour is though . 
UNKNOWN Special colours , isn't it ? 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Per Well , but we know that we're having at least three colours , so Right . 
UNKNOWN I dunno where it yeah . 
UNKNOWN So let's y say three . 
UNKNOWN Well , are we talking about on each colour combination or are we , you know , we'll like we'll have yellow and black . 
UNKNOWN Is that two special colours ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I dunno . 
UNKNOWN Or or is white and black , then two more or Uh . 
UNKNOWN That I thi I thought that would be under yours . 
UNKNOWN I guess it's three , three three . 
UNKNOWN We'll just say three . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
UNKNOWN Maybe the R_R_ will be in colour as well , so yeah . 
UNKNOWN Interface , we're doing push buttons . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And how many buttons do we have ? 
UNKNOWN We have six . 
UNKNOWN We've got five . 
UNKNOWN Oh no , five . 
UNKNOWN Six , with the power . 
UNKNOWN Oh six . 
UNKNOWN Six . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Anything else ? 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN Oh , we'll do we wa Are the buttons in special colour , special f I didn't get information on Well , does it but if we're making multiple varieties of this is where I'm getting confused . 
UNKNOWN Oh wait . 
UNKNOWN Oh , buttons oh , so um . 
UNKNOWN So the case material will just have one colour , right , but then the buttons will be in special colours ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN We're saying per unit . 
UNKNOWN per unit , okay , okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , per unit . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so each unit will only have one colour on their but the case is could have up to thr I mean the buttons could ea could be up to three colours , 'cause that how it's designed there . 
UNKNOWN Alright , and each button s Yeah , okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I like it like that . 
UNKNOWN So Special form ? 
UNKNOWN They're all kind of just push button , right ? 
UNKNOWN No , I think they're fine . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Special material ? 
UNKNOWN Material , we want them rubber as well probably , yeah . 
CONFUSION Uh . 
UNKNOWN Oh do I have to do it per button , do I ? 
UNKNOWN No , I don't think so . 
UNKNOWN I think they're if they're all gonna be rubber then it that's what it matters . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , 'cause it wouldn't make sense otherwise , 'cause for the whole mat case material it's only one . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It's I mean it's two to make it rubber . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Oh wait , so maybe . 
UNKNOWN Thirteen point seven . 
UNKNOWN Oh oh . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , what can we reduce ? 
UNKNOWN Okay , let's have our buttons all be one colour . 
UNKNOWN Mm , I kind of like the buttons . 
UNKNOWN Let's see what that would do . 
UNKNOWN It's only gonna bring us down to thirteen point three anyway . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
UNKNOWN Okay um , are we sure this is double-curved ? 
CONFUSION Uh . 
UNKNOWN Maybe it's single-curved , we have no idea . 
UNKNOWN We have no idea . 
UNKNOWN I dunno , I didn't get any pictures . 
UNKNOWN It's single curved . 
UNKNOWN It's single curved . 
UNKNOWN Why not ? 
UNKNOWN Well it's not the yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay , it's the kinetic battery that's kind of expensive , but we have a simple chip , single curve , case material is rubber and it's a special colour , but that's important . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN That is important . 
UNKNOWN Six buttons we have to have six buttons . 
UNKNOWN How did it get more expensive , what did you just change ? 
UNKNOWN What ? 
UNKNOWN It was it was thirteen and now it's fifteen . 
UNKNOWN No , okay , maybe not . 
UNKNOWN I don't know what just happened . 
UNKNOWN Now it's twelve . 
UNKNOWN We Yeah , they are . 
UNKNOWN What was our target price again ? 
UNKNOWN Twelve point five . 
UNKNOWN Twelve point five . 
UNKNOWN Hey hey . 
UNKNOWN Twelve point five . 
UNKNOWN So we're just just about there . 
UNKNOWN So we're okay , I think . 
UNKNOWN We're all set then . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Ish . 
UNKNOWN Okay , we're all set . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
UNKNOWN Um save . 
UNKNOWN I saved that to our um our big shared folder , so you know . 
UNKNOWN Um okay , back to agenda. 
UNKNOWN Um are the are the costs under twelve fifty Euro ? 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Let's move on to the project evaluation . 
UNKNOWN Project process . 
UNKNOWN Satisfaction with for example the room for creativity , leadership , teamwork , the means , any new ideas found . 
UNKNOWN So I guess what we're gonna talk about here is just evaluating how we created this project , the information we got on the news , how we used it , if we were able to um , you know , use our creativity with the information , um how how well I guess I led it , um the how well we worked together as a team , um the digital pens , the whiteboard . 
UNKNOWN Well . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN I felt very creative . 
UNKNOWN I enjoyed making the prototypes . 
UNKNOWN I think we've been successful in that we've achieved almost all of the design goals that we've set and we've come up with a finished project and we just about got cost . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think we could've done even better with a little bit more information , like what's a single-curved case , how many colours , what do colours count things , but given given what we had I think that we did we did really well . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um I think we worked together pretty well . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I mean if I'd had more market research on the fruits and vegetables , maybe we could've taken that into account . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But the fruits and vegetables , they really my creativity , so . 
UNKNOWN I know , I really did , the the whole mango idea was great . 
UNKNOWN No , I mean I thought the pen was a little distracting for me personally , like its heaviness , and like just being so conscious of like turning the pages, I dunno . 
UNKNOWN Do you think we could Yeah . 
UNKNOWN That was a bit of a distraction . 
UNKNOWN That was the last one , like I chose not to do a PowerPoint'cause I didn't think it made sense to , so I liked that I had the option to do that and just to take my own notesand that whole sort of thing . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think we all made um very significant contributions , I don't think anybody dominated it , which I thought was really good , like each of us was able to um like each of you had your information and I uh I tried to facilitate it without like taking over , um I like our little finished products . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN They're funny . 
UNKNOWN Really cute . 
UNKNOWN I kind of want one . 
UNKNOWN Can we market this as the mango remote ? 
UNKNOWN Should we have that somewhere on the packaging ? 
UNKNOWN I have a little R_R_ . 
UNKNOWN I'm trying to think of a good pun that I could add there . 
UNKNOWN I know , let's think of it like a little jingle . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN I like the R_R_ , that's gonna be etched in . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN Hopefully not with just my fingernail at some point but um it's quite a useful little gadget . 
UNKNOWN All thanks to Iain for the design of that one . 
UNKNOWN . 
UNKNOWN Okay um new ideas found ? 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN What did we find for new ideas ? 
UNKNOWN People should really base their remotes on fruits and vegetables . 
UNKNOWN Definitely . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Or or at least be c p creative enough to think of toggle switches mm etcetera . 
UNKNOWN I I am really into the idea of kinetic batteries now after reading about them . 
UNKNOWN Oh , I'm so excited . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I didn't even know they existed . 
UNKNOWN That was I I knew you can get watches that had them , like really quite expensive watches that just never need a battery , 'cause you're always moving your wrist . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN But in other things , I think it'd be really good . 
UNKNOWN I thi yeah , that's awesome . 
UNKNOWN Um okay , closing . 
UNKNOWN Are the costs within the budget ? 
UNKNOWN Is the project evaluated ? 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN Now there's the final questionnaire and meeting summary . 
UNKNOWN Um so , this is the great product kids , I think we've created something really interesting and that we have a market for it , um especially if we can produce it at twelve point three which we hope um yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Make sure in your questionnaire to put down criticisms of both the process and the um the final results and . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , Real Reaction . 
UNKNOWN I do like the Martian remote . 
UNKNOWN If we could choose more than one , that would be my second choice . 
UNKNOWN Oh , that would definitely be my second choice . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Although the tog toggle I'm afraid I would It's cool . 
UNKNOWN That's cool . 
UNKNOWN Let's all let's all go for the yellow Break the stem off . 
UNKNOWN I would break it . 
UNKNOWN I would break it . 
UNKNOWN I think I would break it . 
UNKNOWN It started because I wanted to have it as st as a stem and then alright , so Is it started as a pear , but then it started looking more and more like a Martian when I put the Take me to your leader . 
UNKNOWN Oh that's funny . 
UNKNOWN Kind of looks like a penguin , like with no eye . 
UNKNOWN Oh yeah , it's kind of a penguin . 
UNKNOWN I like that it stands up . 
UNKNOWN Mm-mm . 
UNKNOWN Wow , maybe I should market it to some remote control company now . 
UNKNOWN So are are poor little thing . 
UNKNOWN That was bound to happen Mm . 
UNKNOWN Oh , sad . 
UNKNOWN Mm 'kay , congratulations . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Anything else to say ? 
UNKNOWN Nothing will come up until after our meeting's supposed to be over , its all timed . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN Um anybody have I got more master classes , anybody else wanna like take a master's class ? 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN It's really funny that you got spam in your work emails . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but check it out . 
UNKNOWN So like there are all these like links , they don't go anywhere . 
UNKNOWN But all that you need to keep in mind your knowledge management . 
UNKNOWN Um just wanna make sure you do . 
UNKNOWN No the first one that you sent like I didn't realise that it was a joke and I was like why did she send this to us ? 
UNKNOWN Oh It is . 
UNKNOWN It's very it's very work relevant , 'cause people send spam a lot . 
UNKNOWN Yes definitely I'm very sad that I didn't get any links to the corporate website . 
UNKNOWN Oh here you can you can view . 
UNKNOWN . 
UNKNOWN Let's see , what did I get through the corporate website ? 
UNKNOWN It's just inspiration about circuit boards . 
UNKNOWN You can just see what's up . 
UNKNOWN Wow . 
UNKNOWN Yeah it's it's really deep . 
UNKNOWN Hold on . 
UNKNOWN Takes a little while to get excited to load . 
UNKNOWN That the Excel thing is pretty cool . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that is pretty neat . 
UNKNOWN Here , like , basically it's like inspiration , basically I'm gonna give you two sentences on fashion and that kind of thing , see . 
UNKNOWN I love Excel , it's one of my favourite programs . 
UNKNOWN You didn't miss out that much . 
UNKNOWN I see , mm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , my inspiration from from last time is the in interior of a remote control being taken apart bit by bit , talking about circuit boards . 
UNKNOWN Spongy . 
UNKNOWN I learned a lot actually . 
UNKNOWN Oh wow . 
UNKNOWN I could probably take apart a remote control now if I really needed to . 
UNKNOWN This one was cooler . 
UNKNOWN I got a whole table and everything . 
UNKNOWN Now I have all about circuits and chips and transponders and I wrote it all down , because I thought it would be relevant , like all the different parts of the inside of a remote control , but then they're like , you don't actually need this you just need to talk about the case . 
UNKNOWN That's like mine it was like , would you prefer an L_C_D_ screen or a multifunction remote control ? 
UNKNOWN And then it didn't have like any kind of table , like awesome , I'm glad they asked that question and didn't reportthe result . 
UNKNOWN It's really interesting though . 
UNKNOWN I I thought it was a little tricky having to hand around this thing . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN We had a lot of the um otherwise the technology today was kinda cool . 
UNKNOWN I think . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN That was really neat how I got emails and No . 
UNKNOWN We didn't we didn't use the whiteboard that much . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN Although I don't see how we could have very l at least for me I Mm . 
UNKNOWN I yeah . 
UNKNOWN If I'd gotten pictures of the different parts of the case , the different looks of the case , I would have probably drawn them up , but Yeah , we could've put our brainstorming stuff up there rather than just talking about it , but with only four people it doesn't really make sense . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause we weren't like voting on anything and I think usually , like whiteboards are good , you know like crossing out ideas , or like if we had had like a brainstorming period . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN But I thought we were good orally . 
UNKNOWN Get crazy . 
UNKNOWN I think if you had a larger group Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And with and with the PowerPointthat we can all look at , like you can do all those things pretty much on PowerPointas that's not as necessary to have . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And these might've made us more willing to like take notesthan to like write up them here , 'cause we all needed them separately , kind of on the whiteboards in this room . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Because we're all gonna be working in different places . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN We if we were all gonna stay in here all the time , then having the notesup on the whiteboard would've been alright , but everyone needs their own , like specific notes, I guess . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Now when you were um creating your um prototypes here , did you work together or did you like do separate projects ? 
UNKNOWN Uh we we worked together , um but we were making like we sort of made different shapes and then discussed how the how the buttons might work , um and how we could like improve on the on the design . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So it was a bit of both really , we just kind of started out by each taking a colour of clay and just fooling around with it and I came up with that rhombus shape and he came up with the sort of potatoey , mangoey shape , and then just went from there really . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Cool . 
UNKNOWN It was fun . 
UNKNOWN So well done with the management , I felt well managed . 
UNKNOWN Oh thanks . 
UNKNOWN I think we did well in first of all giving our meetings the time , and second we actually we we did a good job of making firm decisions at the ends of the meetings . 
UNKNOWN It's kinda fun . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Sorry . 
UNKNOWN And I I know what happens sometimes is that you tend to sort of have meetings and then people sorta drift away without anything actually really being decided . 
UNKNOWN That happened to me all the time though . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN But I think here we got we got clear and and decisive decisive points at the end of the meetings , so that we we knew where to go on from there . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I was quite worried at the end of the last meeting that we weren't getting we didn't really have enough information to make firm decisions , but we were able to do it regardless , so . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN I'm not usually a very decisive person , so it helped to have people say this needs to be done in five minutes . 
UNKNOWN This is what we'll do . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I found that we did we could have used another five or ten minutes sometimes in the meetings . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , for some of the meetings , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Especially last time , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah I think the last time we had a lot of information , but at the same time not quite enough , you know what I mean , like we we couldn't answer every single question . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Um but Mm . 
UNKNOWN And I I felt the first two meetings , that I was coming in with no information , and not sort of made me really like , ooh I don't know , throwing together PowerPointout of no no information and then last time it was like the opposite . 
UNKNOWN I had so much information and so much to talk about . 
UNKNOWN It was interesting what came out like later , like as I was doing the when I was doing the breakdown on the agendathat they gave me um , that more points came out from your presentationeven . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN I'm a little I am a little disappointed that we didn't do a um something for losing the remote , because that was kind of a big point . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN that was something like in order to talk about that we would've had to have actual knowledge about circuit boards and things like Yeah . 
UNKNOWN About yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well the problem was , even when we just were creating from the Excel file, there wasn't like a option to select to somehow have it included , so there was no we could be like yeah , it has it included . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN I think we were Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN There was no way for us to have written down that it was really there . 
UNKNOWN Considered the re yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think we were just getting overenthusiastic with the task . 
UNKNOWN Well it's interesting that they Mm-hmm , yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think we really got into it , I mean I got into it as the day went on and I got really like , ooh I'm designing a remote control , I dunno if that's just me , but Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It was interesting though that they put that fifty percent of people say they have frustration with losing their remote and yet they didn't provide us with information to um we weren't provided with information to discuss that . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I know that like people people have like things they can put on their keys that you press it and it'll beep , but I but I'm sure that would require some kind of technology that I just don't know what it is , but Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think there are some of those like infomercial remotes that have things so you won't lose them . 
UNKNOWN I dunno . 
UNKNOWN I mean we were talking about it and like i in my household at least , there's only about two places that the remote is ever 'cause there's only one T_V_ and there's only like three chairs . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN That's like saying you're never gonna lose your keys , and I always do , anyway . 
UNKNOWN You'll lose 'em in your pocket , like you just will forget that or you like put it down somewhere that like made sense and then not remember , there's always ways to lose things . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It d yeah , it depends on how organised you are personally , but Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , or like I guess what the setup of the house is too . 
UNKNOWN But , I mean I am notorious for losing my keys , I just I guess I've just never lost the remote . 
UNKNOWN I put my keys in the refrigerator the other night and couldn't find them . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause I was putting groceries away . 
UNKNOWN That's funny . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN You you're taking stuff from a bag and putting them in the refrigerator and then go back to my room . 
UNKNOWN Can't get in . 
UNKNOWN Can't get in , look all around the kitchen . 
UNKNOWN Definitely in the vegetable drawer . 
UNKNOWN That's funny . 
UNKNOWN So . 
UNKNOWN I always do that , leaving it in my coat , and then like using a different coat . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN But I guess it's 'cause we don't carry remotes around that much . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Can't really take it into the other room . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Maybe with our little robot one we could've had him have a robot , alien , pear , whatever he is , have a little voice like , I am located Oh a G_P_S_ system , internal G_P_S_ . 
UNKNOWN Oh man . 
UNKNOWN Here you go . 
UNKNOWN Although if it's sitting still for too long . 
UNKNOWN We should make one that walks by itself . 
UNKNOWN Yes I Or little Or just just a wheel , you know . 
UNKNOWN That really could get up and walk away . 
UNKNOWN Or or like some crazy like electro-magnet , that you push it and it'll go zoom to the T_V_ and stick there . 
UNKNOWN Just if you like you'd have a remote for your remote , that'll . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well , but if you could attach them to the T_V_ , then you can . 
UNKNOWN zoom Yeah . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN All kinds of possibilities . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Sorry , I'm just um trying to update my minutes. 
UNKNOWN I decided to you know how I sent you the emailsaying that PowerPointminuteswill be complimentary , rather than like repeating them . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Just gonna make I'm making full minutes, so that it'll include all of the agendaand all that . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN Wow . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause that seems a little more useful . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause you've had like the most typing and organising to do . 
UNKNOWN But I didn't have like information to sloth through either , so Most of it , mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I guess How much of your PowerPointwas already done for you , every meeting . 
UNKNOWN I added slides, um I added a couple slideseach time , but that was about it . 
SURPRISE Oh .
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I didn't even think about adding slides, 'cause I would just get slideswith titles on them and fill them all in w didn't even think about adding more . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Well , the thing was they would provide y an agendawith s like several points , but it wouldn't have a slidefor each point . 
UNKNOWN Ah yeah. . 
UNKNOWN And that's the only way I remember that I need to go other that point . 
UNKNOWN I know personally when I do PowerPoint, that's what I do and so I had it once , even if it was just like the title of it , like the three presentations, and I would do your three . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN You have you have to have the slogan on it or can it just be like Okay good . 
UNKNOWN The slogan on it ? 
UNKNOWN No , no , definitely not . 
UNKNOWN No no no . 
UNKNOWN We No , I don't think we need to I think the R_ and R_ , especially if the yellow and black one . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause I was like , it could go around the outside . 
UNKNOWN I think we just need the um the R_R_ , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Is it yellow and blue ? 
UNKNOWN Or yellow and blue . 
UNKNOWN Lemme go to the web page. 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I was just kinda going by the web page, 'cause they didn't give me any clear , like yellow , grey , or . 
UNKNOWN Oh I guess it is black , grey . 
UNKNOWN Grey is better than black , doesn't look so bumblebeeish . 
UNKNOWN I don't really like yellow in general . 
UNKNOWN Hey now I understand the random like newsclippings . 
UNKNOWN But it Wasn't it interesting that um I thought it was interesting that our market marketing um expert did not agree with the marketing um the marketing choices , you know , like that was a bit of a conflict . 
UNKNOWN Finish meeting now . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN I will I just feel like if you're really doing like a a really big market evaluation , you wouldn't just have like one set of source , it's kind of an they were so not backed up , it would just be a sentence like we did a survey , this is what people said . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN S mm , I dunno . 
UNKNOWN People are stupid . 
UNKNOWN I guess it i it sort of a grey , isn't it ? 
UNKNOWN Yellow and grey , but then the slogan's in blue . 
UNKNOWN Well we got some grey and we got some blue buttons , we're good . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well we don't have the right colour clay anyway . 
UNKNOWN Maybe , like I don't know . 
UNKNOWN That could always be . 
UNKNOWN Well we're not , sadly , going to actually be producing this , so . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN If they ever come out with potato I'm gonna have to Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Potato mango shaped remotes . 
UNKNOWN I'm claiming it intellectual property . 
UNKNOWN I can't believe a whole day is gone . 
UNKNOWN I know . 
UNKNOWN I don't feel like it's been that long . 
UNKNOWN Get sucked in . 
UNKNOWN Mm I haven't gotten questionnaire eight yet . 
UNKNOWN Are you sure I got it all head's kinda small . 
UNKNOWN How're we placed in terms of the alright . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN We're okay ? 
UNKNOWN Guess I should probably try to sit up straight . 
UNKNOWN Like that ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay , cool . 
UNKNOWN We're good ? 
UNKNOWN Oh , I think mine's fallen off . 
UNKNOWN It fell That's why . 
UNKNOWN I guess it's gonna be hard to drink coffee . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Uh okay . 
UNKNOWN Ah . 
UNKNOWN Okay ? 
UNKNOWN Right , so I'm just gonna start this PowerPointreal quick . 
UNKNOWN Wow . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , PowerPoint. 
UNKNOWN Very official . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , well , you know , . 
UNKNOWN Yeah I kinda like this I'm kinda getting into it . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN So just to kick off the meeting basically um so we're working now for a real reaction , this is uh so it right . 
UNKNOWN Just got an agendato set out what we're gonna try to accomplish in this particular first meeting . 
UNKNOWN Um We're gonna just do a quick opening and we can hopefully all get acquainted with one another um then we're gonna start talk a little bit about tool training . 
UNKNOWN Essentially that means getting used to the only thing that we haven't tried out yet , the whiteboard . 
UNKNOWN Um we've got a general plan for the project how we're gonna go about accomplishing this and then just a bit of discussion close up . 
UNKNOWN Um I guess you know game or something um in real life um so yeah basically I want to I'm just gonna you got of course you can discuss that , I'm thinking about um uh proposing that since we've got this weird blend of ourselves and our roles that we just don't ask , don't tell . 
UNKNOWN Um so um if you say something about marketing , right , sorted , um y is Exactly . 
UNKNOWN You're just gonna believe me , we'll go from there . 
UNKNOWN Fair enough . 
UNKNOWN Um I mean obvi if if you guys if if at the same time if you like logically if something doesn't like if I'm like we're gonna sell a remote control that's the size of this paperbookyou know um you say like well that doesn't seem like such a good idea because of X_ obviously go with it . 
UNKNOWN I mean we'll discuss it but I'm not gonna ask do you know that or uh yeah it seems like yeah yeah exactly so , 'cause we're what we're sort of role playing is y g yeah you're gonna tap into your own knowledge as well um . 
UNKNOWN Prove it yeah , okay . 
UNKNOWN And that's the same for your when we do introductions I mean um and you talk about your background you know have fun , you know maybe you went to um uh you know maybe i you're like in Maine you went to U_C_S_B_ but you wanna say you went to Harvard or something like that , why not , you know you can this is you know I guess we can have a little bit of fun with it . 
UNKNOWN So are you guys okay with that does that seem logical ? 
UNKNOWN Oh yeah , that's fine . 
CONFIRMATION Sure . 
UNKNOWN Works for me . 
UNKNOWN Sweet . 
CONFIRMATION Cool . 
UNKNOWN So I guess that that we're totally we're making a remote control which is thrilling um uh but the idea is that we can make something based on the whole corporate model I dunno if you guys had time to check the in real life I dunno if you guys uh checked the um uh the corporate website . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Um we've got to make something as fashionable as possible , that's kind of the corporate strategy is we're gonna try to take ordinary stuff that nobody really thinks about and try to make it nice you know like John Lewis nice or you know if you go to Debenham's or something . 
UNKNOWN So um basically we are reinventing the wheel but we wanna try to do it in a user friendly um slick sleek kind of way . 
UNKNOWN Um way we're gonna go about doing that is basically at first we're gonna start on the basics . 
UNKNOWN And that's where I'm gonna need you guys the User Interface Designers and the um um the other designer that I can't remember , the the I_D_ and the U_I_D_ right um the Industrial Designer hey right on alright , getting into it um to guide me and guide us on this project 'cause you're gonna be you're g you guys are the bottom you know you're like no you can't do that you can't have you know X_ and Y_ um at the same time . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN There you go . 
UNKNOWN And then um we'll work up from what is necessary to more like what would be good , you know like um I I think you guys probably got the same emails I did but the idea of um , yes a coffee pot needs to be able to hold coffee but it's also better if it's not like really cheap glass so that it if you touch it you hurt your hand , or something like that . 
UNKNOWN Um and so we'll work up from there and um then we'll meet on and talk about it and then finally we'll incorporate as kind of the last stage you know where you guys build or tell me tell us what's possible and then you tell us what we can um hope for and what way to go take the the the take the basics and make it nicer and then ov obviously uh the U_I_D_ and the I_D_ you know you you can keep on the you know sort of at the cutting edge of how to get about maximising what is possible um to try t of sync it all up . 
UNKNOWN So that's the detailed design . 
UNKNOWN So it's a three stage kind of thing . 
UNKNOWN Um right so for now just for th the white board um basically uh just to get used to it , I haven't tried it yet either um I'm just gonna start and um mm carry like five remotes around um and just write down I'm just gonna write down one of the names of my um desert discs you know if you if you were trapped on a desert island and you could only bring five C_D_s along with you name one of them that you could , not all five , if you wanna write all five go for it but name one of them that you could um . 
UNKNOWN Oh , we skipped introductions .

UNKNOWN Going to s like North Carol I'm sorry you you just can't get a better burrito than what's available in the s in San Diego . 
UNKNOWN It's different . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause in San Diego th the tortillas are cooked on the grill and in northern California they steam them . 
UNKNOWN It must make all the difference . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , it really does . 
UNKNOWN Well it's it's i there's other things too there's you just can't place it like I when I went to school in the U_ in Santa Barbara which is central California the Mexican food is okay , it's just not good like and yeah it's like two bucks , like literally two bucks for this massive I miss yeah good call on that . 
UNKNOWN Ah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Where you from in San Diego ? 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Um just literally just metropolitan San Diego , I live like five minutes from the zoo . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So North Park actually if you want to get real specific . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , my grandparents lived on um thirty second . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN Close t uh do you know where Clare de Lune coffee shop is , and Cafe Forte Cool . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN On university , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah it's actually like literally half a mile from my house . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , pretty cool . 
UNKNOWN Small world as we were discussing before . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Especially when we're all from the same general region . 
UNKNOWN Right so okay , success on the whiteboard . 
UNKNOWN There you go . 
UNKNOWN You can harness the awesome power a little bit introductions we talked about some of our C_D_s and things we like about the city you know , I think we'll Um right so moving on to not fun stuff uh project finance . 
UNKNOWN Wow . 
UNKNOWN Um basically what we're trying to do is sell this remote for twenty five Euros . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN This is what the finance department has told me , the C_F_O_ but I don't know , I'm not sold on this , it's pretty dear , I mean twenty f that's like you know forty bucks for a remote . 
UNKNOWN It would have to pretty much like do my laundry for me . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Um so what we can maybe work on that a later but we're gonna make a lot on it , the profit aims to make fifty million Euros on it . 
UNKNOWN Eur internationally . 
UNKNOWN So um one of the things I I was gonna mention to you um you guys the designers is that um it m we probably need a rever it needs to be a universal remote control probably . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um so something that could do N_T_S_C_ as well as PAL as well as various other formats like if it's gonna control D_V_D_s but um you know I'll leave that to you guys but that's something that i i it is gonna be an international sold thing . 
UNKNOWN Makes sense . 
CONFUSION Uh . 
UNKNOWN Um but we wanna try to make it for twelve fifty . 
UNKNOWN So we wanna try to make a hundred percent profit on it if we can . 
UNKNOWN Um s right so um just to close up , I'm not sure how much time I've used mm next time right Project Manager , sorted . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Is uh we'll meet in another half an hour or so um and I'd like the um Industrial Designer to get ge think about what needs to be done , like what the basic function of it . 
UNKNOWN Um U_I_D_ well yeah you right g your assignments are up there and you'll also get s assignments from in your emailas well more spec specifics on what do do . 
UNKNOWN Um mm basic and um so I need you to tell us what um we what the user's gonna want . 
UNKNOWN What they're looking for . 
UNKNOWN So actually in a way you guys c maybe in our next meeting chat a bit about what the user's gonna want and what the user can have , you know like uh so yeah well it is and we'll discuss the trade-offs in between um so yeah specific instructions will be sent in your email. 
UNKNOWN And negotiate that . 
CONFUSION Uh . 
UNKNOWN But I think that that is more or less a good place to start for now um and as more things come up we'll have meetings and you'll get emails and so forth . 
UNKNOWN Um any questions , before we get started ? 
UNKNOWN I assume that we're building a stand alone uh remote control , we can't kind of build it into other uh products . 
UNKNOWN You mean to like Hmm . 
UNKNOWN For instance like a mobile phone or something like that . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Sounds interesting . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I don't think there's any rules about it yet . 
UNKNOWN So Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Maybe our personal coach will have something to say about that . 
UNKNOWN Or or you know can we produ can we sell a remote control phone for twenty five pounds or less ? 
UNKNOWN Well , have a think about it . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN I mean I'm I'm certainly op it seems like yeah it it seems like it's certainly do-able isn't it . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN W yeah . 
UNKNOWN I mean um or if we can't have a full mobile phone maybe a remote that has some other kind of useful function . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN The clapper . 
UNKNOWN No I mean no , good idea , good idea . 
UNKNOWN We'll see what see what Uh-huh y I like that Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Maybe a remote with changeable faces , like the faces that you can buy for phones . 
UNKNOWN I like the little cover thingies . 
UNKNOWN Nice . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Hot . 
UNKNOWN That's true , I guess we we probably have some time , maybe we should brainstorm a bit like what we wanna do , go back to um I don't really have any . 
UNKNOWN Let me bring up something about our basic goals here , what we want to accomplish . 
UNKNOWN Uh project announcement . 
UNKNOWN Ts ts ts Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Not so much . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN All right we'll find them , we're on our own . 
UNKNOWN Now are we also discussing kind of our initial ideas at all here ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah yeah let's do it , let's do . 
UNKNOWN S does anybody have any initial ideas ? 
UNKNOWN I'm gonna go ahead and take noteson this too 'cause Yeah I mean oh yeah right . 
UNKNOWN Good idea . 
UNKNOWN Start your minutes. 
UNKNOWN Um Well it's pretty much given it's gonna be universal right , we decided that already and it may be functioning for other things , as soon as you said that I was thinking like all the other things you could get a remote to do , like your microwave or your front door or like to have everything on one thing , but then , I've never been a fan of those huge remotes that have like a million buttons , you can't tell what they do . 
UNKNOWN So initial ideas . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN S smaller's better . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Simple . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But I'm thinking I'm thinking kind of P_D_A_ uh design so touch screen design rather than button so that you can kind of flip around all sorts of different things . 
UNKNOWN Specific . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Oh right . 
UNKNOWN That'd be different . 
UNKNOWN Interesting . 
UNKNOWN Yeah that's slick isn't it . 
UNKNOWN I mean like stylist yeah like a just a yeah . 
UNKNOWN True . 
UNKNOWN Right so we got five minutes more to chat about this , perfect . 
UNKNOWN Um so we've got this kind of an idea of a trade-off between um uh size and functionality . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Um and we also I'm also gonna note for future reference this idea of um so you like maybe like an L_ like a touch screen type of remote ? 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN We want it to be munt multifunctional but at the same time if you get it to do too much you're not gonna be able to tell them apart , that whole yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Too confusing . 
UNKNOWN It's gonna be too complicated , too crowded with buttons and things . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Possibly . 
UNKNOWN I don't think one exists . 
UNKNOWN An interesting option . 
UNKNOWN Be a good idea . 
UNKNOWN Needs it needs one outstanding feature to set it apart from all the other remotes . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Definitely . 
UNKNOWN Yeah all the other universal remotes . 
UNKNOWN Um I don't know if there's such a thing out there , I guess we could do some uh do some research on or one of us could do some research on it about whether or not there are um multi-format like um you know PAL , N_T_S_C_ , region one Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN I'm pretty sure there is . 
UNKNOWN I mean I I have a friend who has a P_D_A_ that he just points at his telev any television he wants and it'll figure out the the specifications of it and will control it um so I th I assume that that can be done with uh kind of around the world . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN That Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Interesting . 
UNKNOWN Awesome . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um all right . 
UNKNOWN So . 
UNKNOWN I li I'm liking that idea , this idea of a touch screen remote with multi-format features . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFUSION Um . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Let's see . 
UNKNOWN I think , making it out of a nice material would be very important , because so many of those remotes that you see , these universal remotes look so cheap and low quality . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Keeping it nice and slick , would be important . 
UNKNOWN And I don't know , like , there's such a problem with losing them , that adding this whole like P_D_A_ pen business is only one more thing to lose , so we're gonna have to be careful with what like Just something like keep in mind when we start actually dealing with this stuff but that would be really cool . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN Uh let's see . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN I like the idea of the uh multi plate . 
UNKNOWN Yeah yeah okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Fi b like what are they called , those face plate things ? 
UNKNOWN In in I like . 
UNKNOWN Isn't there a name for them ? 
UNKNOWN Think they're just called face plates ? 
UNKNOWN Are they ? 
UNKNOWN I don't know . 
UNKNOWN something , uh we'll have to come up with a name , patent it . 
UNKNOWN I dunno . 
UNKNOWN We should c we should come up with a fuzzy one as well . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Something really cool . 
UNKNOWN For those cold winter days . 
UNKNOWN Leopard printor something . 
UNKNOWN Leopard print. 
CONFUSION Um . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN I think , it wouldn't be such a bad idea to have a like a locator device , maybe a simple button that you have on your television to help you find your remote . 
UNKNOWN True . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN But if we're bundling it unless we're selling their telly with the remote . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Um Cou could we not do something where like just a little lit like literally just a very small kind of thing that comes with the remote that you could place something else that you press and it makes the remote page. 
UNKNOWN Well if we bundle it as a phone then you can always call it . 
UNKNOWN True . 
UNKNOWN If you're not doing that then we can have something that just kind of rings from either well there used to be those whistling devices but that's a little bit annoying . 
UNKNOWN True . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Kinda like how on a lot of um uh cordless regular phones , you have a pagebutton and it goes , could we do something like that ? 
UNKNOWN Th Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN That's cool . 
UNKNOWN I think so . 
UNKNOWN Probably . 
UNKNOWN I think we could design into that . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Good . 
UNKNOWN Um yeah I think this material quality as well like I guess what we can think about what kind of um uh you know Apple 's been really successful with this surgical white kind of business or this sleek kind of you know Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And that titanium the new silver sleek ones that's last couple of years , very much so . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Curves . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN We do have the minimum am amount I mean we were talking finances I dunno , selling a a forty Pound remote would h or a forty Dollar remote , twenty five Euro remote would be pretty you know it's pretty expensive so maybe we might wanna trade off some of the features for a lower price . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Without without getting into that whole like you know go down to bargain store remote you know bargain store universal remote that's black and you know m massive , some kind of I dunno a balance there in somewhere . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Definitely . 
UNKNOWN But um have a think about what we can do , have a think about what we want to do , how we're gonna sell it and um Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Or if you our users in mind , like these grandmas are not gonna be into this whole new let's design , no it's they're used to the buttons so we'll have to be careful of exactly who we're marketing this to , and who we're gonna be able to get it out of . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN 'S true . 
UNKNOWN But Euros . 
UNKNOWN We're talking twenty five Pounds or twenty five Euros ? 
UNKNOWN Twenty five Euros . 
UNKNOWN Slight difference I guess . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN They're all weaker than they're all stronger than the Dollar . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Although , computer parts , all if you're gonna upgrade your computer , buy it in the States . 
UNKNOWN Like um do you guys know Fry's ? 
UNKNOWN Huge computer uh electronics store ? 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN Mm-mm . 
UNKNOWN They serve um right they sa tha s they will sell things overseas so you can buy stuff in America and have it shipped over for like twenty thirty Pounds about . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Right so um let's go ahead and wrap that up here for now , I'm gonna put these initial ideas that we've got in the um project documents, so if you guys wa need a reminder about what we've talked about um the different you know kind of trade-offs that we've got and the other ideas , you can consult them at your leisure . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN And uh right so thanks for that . 
UNKNOWN Let's just uh head back to work on what we were talking about bef uh goi h h getting into . 
UNKNOWN With half an hour ? 
CONFUSION Um . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN Perfect . 
UNKNOWN Thanks guys . 
CONFIRMATION Cool . 
THANKS Thank you . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
UNKNOWN All set ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Cool . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN So um basically I'm just gonna go over real quickly um some news I've just got from the board on how we're supposed to do with this um remote control . 
UNKNOWN And then I'm gonna turn over to you guys to make brief presentationsum on what you've found and then we'll have a bit of discussion . 
UNKNOWN So basically uh what I've just found out from the board I dunno if you guys got this emailas well but it needs to be television only . 
UNKNOWN So no we're not doing D_V_D_ , we're not doing anything else , it's just gonna be a television remote . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um it also needs to have the company colours included in it . 
UNKNOWN Um so that's red and black . 
UNKNOWN And it has to have the slogan , case you guys forget the slogan it's , we put fashion in electronics . 
UNKNOWN Um and no teletext . 
UNKNOWN I'm not sure what teletext is but I'm assuming you guys do , so we don't wanna include that um in this particular design . 
UNKNOWN For reasons that I don't really know . 
UNKNOWN There's but it's the board so there you go . 
UNKNOWN So basically um given those guidelines which will have some effect on how we design we'll discuss it later I mean 'cause it's television only we'll be able to change our uh um well we can s sacrifice more function for a better television remote . 
UNKNOWN Anyway . 
UNKNOWN So I'm gonna turn over to the Industrial Designer uh to go ahead and make a presentationon Oh , right yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So do I unplug this bit here ? 
UNKNOWN Gotta plug you in . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN Might have to hit function F_ eight but it looks like it's gonna come up . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
CONFIRMATION Cool . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN That's pageone of my presentation. 
UNKNOWN Brilliant . 
CONFIRMATION Very nice . 
UNKNOWN For your first PowerPointit's lovely . 
UNKNOWN So the uh method . 
UNKNOWN We're gonna have to understand how remote controls work and res uh successfully complete this project . 
UNKNOWN Um remote control works as follows . 
UNKNOWN This is all pretty basic stuff you guys . 
UNKNOWN Um sends message to another system , so there's an energy source involved in that like a battery or solar power , something along those lines , there's an integrated circuit , which is the microchip , um and that actually compose the messages and usually the way a a remote control works is it sends infrared bits to another system . 
UNKNOWN A user interface controls the chip , basically that's the casing and the buttons and um accordingly the messages as well . 
UNKNOWN So my findings , um I just did a preliminary study here and uh I found that too much metal in remote design could potentially cause interference with the ability of the remote to send commands . 
UNKNOWN And too much metal can cause remotes to behave unexpectedly by receiving false signals . 
UNKNOWN Um too much metal is used sometimes and people pick up radio signals and the like , and there's also the possibility of the remote catching on fire and injuring the customer , just think of those lawsuits , that'd be really bad . 
UNKNOWN Therefore I suggest primarily plastic construction . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN Um , components . 
UNKNOWN Just some ideas that I had , um , energy source , it's kinda hip to be eco friendly so I thought maybe we could do something with solar power with an alkaline battery backup . 
UNKNOWN Um the user interface , I was since we can't use metal I was thinking maybe a high grade recycled plastic . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN The chip , um , silicon based chip I don't really see any way around that , we can't really be different in that respect . 
UNKNOWN Um , the sender well I'm thinking infrared 'cause it is the industry standard , multi channel , that's a word I made up , I don't really know what it means . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN Uh PAL and N_T_S_C_ compatible and uh probably a two hundred foot range . 
UNKNOWN Fair enough . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN Uh and the receiver of course is any number of electronic devices . 
UNKNOWN Um but in this case it'll only be T_V_s . 
UNKNOWN Um personal preferences , I really think that we should use plastic as opposed to metal , um , the company simply can't afford this kinds of lawsuits which adm admittedly is gonna come at the cost of a certain aesthetic value , 'cause we were thinking Right . 
UNKNOWN Fine . 
UNKNOWN Is is there a way that we can use um modern types of polymers , or mo modern types of plastics that maybe do have some kind of aesthetic value um like if a white like if we talk about like well like on the lapt on these laptops and other ones they use a a pretty nice , you can do i is there some kind of nice colo der quality plastic that we can work with ? 
UNKNOWN It needs , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah that shouldn't be a problem . 
UNKNOWN Um for example the plastic they have on your laptop there is something that's perfectly possible for us to do . 
UNKNOWN Okay , okay . 
CONFIRMATION Cool . 
UNKNOWN That's the end of my presentation. 
CONFIRMATION Great . 
THANKS Thank you very much Nathan . 
UNKNOWN Um if next we can have the um User Interface Developer go ahead and make a brief presentationthat'd be great as well . 
UNKNOWN S plug yourself in here . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Um hit function F_ eight real quickly , hold down Mm . 
UNKNOWN Looks like you're in okay . 
UNKNOWN Is it plugged in well ? 
UNKNOWN There it goes . 
UNKNOWN Computer adjusting . 
UNKNOWN Th Well so . 
UNKNOWN There you go . 
UNKNOWN There you go . 
UNKNOWN Sweet . 
UNKNOWN Here we have a uh my technical functions design presentation. 
UNKNOWN Um so a few of the requirements we need here . 
UNKNOWN Uh we n basically need to operate an electronic device , it needs to be universal um and possibly uh operate several different types of devices although we now uh find that uh that that's no problem . 
UNKNOWN Yeah sorry I couldn't get that g to use before . 
UNKNOWN Um so some of my findings . 
UNKNOWN Um basically wanna send messages uh to a television set . 
UNKNOWN Um that would be any number of different things uh such as switch on the television , uh switch to the next channel , that sort of thing , I think we're all quite uh quite uh intelligent and know know what a normal remote control does . 
UNKNOWN Um now some of the other things I found is a a complicated remote control sorry that we can't quite see my red there very well but uh this remote control has many functions um so it can do a lot of things but it uh it is quite complicated and most users will find it uh find that they won't use most of the functions because they don't know how to use them and don't wanna take the time to learn how to do it . 
UNKNOWN Oh yeah look at that . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN As you also notice it's quite a boring design . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Another remote control , slightly different , it's a simpler remote control uh many less buttons but uh has many fewer functions , um m much easier for the user to manipulate and use . 
UNKNOWN Um it also has a bit of a cheap look and it's also quite boring . 
UNKNOWN So my personal preferences . 
UNKNOWN Revolutionise the idea of uh a remote control . 
UNKNOWN Nice . 
UNKNOWN Um so attain the functionality of a complicated device but use a simple formatted display uh for the user to to work with . 
UNKNOWN And I was gonna add another uh slidehere but I didn't quite have time there . 
CONFUSION Um . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Just incorporating some of the ideas that we had previously like uh having multiple face but it's uh . 
CONFIRMATION Great . 
UNKNOWN Thanks for that Ron . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Does that mean I'm up ? 
UNKNOWN 'Kay yep that's you . 
UNKNOWN I think so . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN I can plug you in . 
UNKNOWN Oh that would be perfect . 
THANKS Thank you . 
UNKNOWN Slideshow up and running . 
UNKNOWN Or not . 
UNKNOWN Give it a little bit . 
CONFUSION Uh . 
UNKNOWN Oh there we go . 
UNKNOWN Perfect . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So this is me . 
UNKNOWN Um basically I was looking through some marketing reports that we've got and we had a usability test where we were actually sort like watching a hundred people use T_V_ remotes and see what it is that they're using and then they filled out a questionnaire about what they like and what they don't about their general T_V_ remote control practices . 
UNKNOWN Um pretty much through testing we were finding out that most of the time , everybody's used to using changing the channel , turning it on , using the volume , m the majority of the time that's all that's going on , the other functions happen , for some people they're important , but the primary uses are really really basic . 
UNKNOWN Um and so big complicated remotes like one we saw in the last presentationare really not the general public's use , they're not using a lot of it , they don't need it , they even find it frustrating when there are all those buttons that they don't know what to do with . 
UNKNOWN And um we also found out that uh fifty percent of our people , their the worst thing about a remote is how often they lose it . 
UNKNOWN And then they can't find it in the room . 
UNKNOWN So I think what we were talking about with a pager or something , will really come into play with a lot of these people . 
UNKNOWN Um there's also a survey about what they liked about remotes , and pretty much they all think they're hideous and not very useful , and the younger demographics are all really interested in voice recognition options . 
UNKNOWN I don't know if that's something we're ready to look into technically , that's up to the design people , but it is s something worth thinking about , especially since the younger demographic's obviously the one that's gonna keep growing , so if that's the direction we're headed in it's something to think about . 
UNKNOWN Um but basically it really is the primary functions and getting it to look nice , which are the standards . 
UNKNOWN So it's a good start for us . 
UNKNOWN That's great . 
THANKS Thank you Sarah . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Need to unplug this ? 
UNKNOWN So um yep I'll just uh switch that back here . 
UNKNOWN Need it back . 
UNKNOWN I'll finish up with just a bit of discussion plan on for the next phase . 
UNKNOWN There you go . 
UNKNOWN Right so I think we've covered most of these important questions through this um through you guys's presentationsum we've got uh y the Industrial Designer suggests uh or pretty much emphatically suggested that we need to go with plastic . 
UNKNOWN Um Sarah , she's recommended that we go for simpler functions , so fewer functions um but we need to decide who are we selling this to , you s your stats suggested that seventy five percent of people under thirty five wanted , thought about voice control , um so do we wanna go for that , or do we want to go for an older demographic , and my thought is um we've got w if we're gonna go for a sleek look I mean we are putting the fashion in electronics um . 
UNKNOWN Oh right . 
UNKNOWN We're not catering to the pensioners of the world I don't think so . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN So maybe this we should look into this younger demographic . 
CONFUSION Um . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN So uh we need to wonder ah h about how we make it better and smaller and faster um think we're constrained to plastics very well , we've got this idea , Ron was saying we need to think about uh revolutionising the way it's looking um , which might be easier given that we're going for simpler function and that we're only going for a telly . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
CONFUSION Uh . 
UNKNOWN Um so um . 
UNKNOWN How th this voice operation thing is I think is a good idea um assuming that it's doable , um at least for the basic controls , maybe we can balance it that way , you know we can see . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Okay you can't say record alias tonight at seven P_M_ but we might be able to say um volume up . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN I think it would be possible to uh combine the locator device and the voice recognition technology . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN That could work . 
UNKNOWN I like that . 
UNKNOWN With a simple command like locate . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And then it could start to beep and therefore be found . 
UNKNOWN Something very basic . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Sounds good . 
UNKNOWN Is that only gonna be within our two hundred foot range then ? 
UNKNOWN Oh yeah I think that's very doable . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN The difficulty wh would be in um I think like i you couldn't speak into the remote that you're trying to find . 
UNKNOWN 'Kay you have something that picks up a voice from far away If it's hidden under the couch but then again you have this wee this wee thing you know that's just a little chip or whatever that has the pagebutton , maybe that could be voice activated too . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It's a good point . 
UNKNOWN A little sticky pad to stick on top of your uh television . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN And you just say something to into that and it finds your The other thing is we might be able to handle the simplicity of a remote control and kind of put the more complicated things into a voice control . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN K Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Or an isolated magnet or something like , or you know something that wouldn't interfere I don't know that'd be the technical thing but yeah I like that , I like that , the voice recognition for the paging system . 
UNKNOWN So it could be sold to both the younger market and the older market . 
UNKNOWN True . 
UNKNOWN And the younger market could use kind of the voi voice control method and the older market might might k exactly and might consider the older market could use the simpler design with the traditional buttons and what not . 
UNKNOWN Making it just an option ? 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN I was thinking uh Oh go ahead . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Are we still thinking about this screen sorry . 
UNKNOWN Go ahead . 
UNKNOWN The uh if we're gonna do this touch pad screen thing , it would be still , do we know if that's an option technically right now to that ? 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN 'S definitely an option technically . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN I've looked into uh costs of uh touch screen methods and what not , they seem to be uh you know almost as cheap as a button method at this point . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN We're doing okay . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause it seems like an interesting option especially because then you could have like your primary screen just be these you know four or five basic functions , you can have menu options or something to have all these other complicated voice recognition , settings , things that you're not gonna use every day and that a lot of people aren't gonna use but it is an option there for this hi-tech market that sort of re is the sleek thing we're going for . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Gotta wonder though , if we're adding so much technology to this one remote , are we still gonna be able to meet out twelve pou our twelve fifty Euro you know goal for selling these things . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN True . 
UNKNOWN Worth looking into . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN It seems like , we're not gonna be able to handle all these functions with just one microchip . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN The microchip is probably the most expensive part of the the whole mechanism . 
UNKNOWN True . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So it's just something to consider . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Absolutely . 
UNKNOWN Mm 'kay um well yeah I guess we'll cross that bridge um in a la slightly later stages of development um but yeah I know , that's perfectly viable question . 
UNKNOWN Mm 'kay um so I'm seeing that we're gonna just basically focus on this young demographic group , aim it at them , but then in a sense that its bells and whistles are available for anybody who wants them but basically we'll make a sleek simple functioned um uh remote control . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um I think this voice recognition thing is a we've got a market for it uh I don't think there's too many , we'd more or less be cornering the market on it as well , we don't have many um . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I appear to have lost my microphone . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Right um we don't have many people or there's not very many competitors out there that do that so cool . 
UNKNOWN Um right . 
UNKNOWN I guess we've c we've touched on most of this . 
UNKNOWN The idea of a paging function , a touch screen , and face plates . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN The thing with I see would there not be a we'd have to maybe sacrifice the face plates for a touch screen ? 
UNKNOWN Um I'm not sure that's sincerely correct , I think if you kind of take the example of a mobile phone that uh trying to pass a portion of the device is not interchangeable whereas the surrounding portions are interchangeable . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Just the casing . 
UNKNOWN We could have the casing , the the face plates . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Back to the uh the cost the material . 
UNKNOWN We have to ask whether we're going to include a certain number of face plates with the package ? 
UNKNOWN That's something I w for say we're including three or four face plates , it's gonna drive the cost up . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN And the other question is , if we do include them are we really in a position to evaluate that market ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN We haven't done any tests on face plates and whether See if there if there's even interest out there . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Off the top of my head it sounds kind of like a gimmick that wouldn't really go anywhere . 
UNKNOWN Yeah 'cause then ha you would have to who all it's not like with cell phones like where you have a you know Nokia model X_ and then ten people make face plates for it , we'd be just our model of pho of t remote control . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well in the publicity of a face plate on a phone is you have it out and around , it is sort of emblematic whereas you're just sit at home , so unless somebody comes over to watch T_V_ True . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well hopefully some people have people coming t over to w to hang out at your house and most people have their televisions in the living room . 
UNKNOWN True . 
UNKNOWN True . 
CONFUSION Uh . 
UNKNOWN Alright well we can we can discuss that one further when we think about um whether th when we do costs and so forth , um . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Oh yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Sure . 
UNKNOWN True , if plastic is dead cheap and if we're making the whole thing out of plastic anyway um yeah we'll cross that bridge later um but yeah we will have to evaluate what's most important . 
UNKNOWN Um I think we've had a bit of discussion already on this thing , n s there any other questions comments that came up in these presentations? 
UNKNOWN Well have we confirmed that we're gonna go ahead with a uh touch screen um Interface ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah yeah okay . 
UNKNOWN Um Yeah I think that would be best . 
UNKNOWN Let's based on what sh on what you guys have all said to me let's go for a plastic built or uh b plastic cased 'cause tha tha that's easy on the cost , try to look for some kind of high quality recycled plastic as you recommended and I think that's a great idea . 
UNKNOWN With a touch screen for the basic functions . 
UNKNOWN Um And we'll yeah tha let's provisionally let's go for a touch screen one with several submenus um for possible extra stuff that one basically put the channel and the on and off switch on the touch screen . 
UNKNOWN Um do we have Mm wait a minuteit occurs to me that if we have a touch screen people are going to have to recharge their remote controls . 
UNKNOWN Yet at the same time that might help for this whole complaint of it being lost . 
UNKNOWN True . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause it would have a docking base ? 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN But then again that costs as well . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN So these new lithium batteries they last twenty years even with the touch screen ? 
UNKNOWN Do they ? 
UNKNOWN Those new ones . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Can we afford that ? 
UNKNOWN Can we afford to include one of those ? 
UNKNOWN And will somebody buy it if we don't ? 
UNKNOWN Well I I don't think yeah I can't see anybody buying a lap a remote control that they have to plug in so we'd have to see some kind of new battery technology . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Okay so let's go with a um touch screen with um some kind of you know with with some kind of cutting edge battery technology Yeah well hey you know well it's it's worth looking into , if not we can always default to just doing a a well presented plastic simple you know so you know . 
UNKNOWN For twelve Euros ? 
UNKNOWN It is . 
UNKNOWN Fair enough . 
UNKNOWN The basics . 
UNKNOWN Well yeah I mean you can put the we could I I dunno I mean I suppose we could put the the basics on the centre easiest you know , you know people know the channel and volume function make them large and easy to get at and then the the other the other bits and bobs you know go through menu um w we'll do the aesthetics . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Okay so we'll touch screen and the battery , focus on um uh presentation. 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN Um it's th uh with this voice recognition option as well um just as for the simple functions the um the on off , channels , volume , um and um a small paging function . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Even if you can't do voice recognition for the paging you know just some kind of simple button that's just a I guess another infrared signal to the remote control and while to emit some kind of paging . 
UNKNOWN Just a beep . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um right so any comments ? 
UNKNOWN Thoughts before we break into go into the next round of individual work on this . 
UNKNOWN Since we're doing uh touch screen , do we wanna look into the possibility of people being able to input different types of skins for the you know the actual interface part of it and things like that ? 
UNKNOWN Or is it just gonna be one touch screen for everybody . 
UNKNOWN Be interesting . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN What what would be on that touch screen ? 
UNKNOWN 'Cause you said earlier that we have to think about company colours and um logo or something or motto , I can't remember exactly what you said . 
UNKNOWN And oh . 
UNKNOWN Yeah the the fashion do . 
UNKNOWN We put fashion into electronics . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN W it's my understanding that if you were going to do a skin you'd need to have some way for people to download or import skins into the remote control . 
UNKNOWN Right , and then you're dealing with ports and cords and Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah I think perhaps good idea but yeah I think that that one m might just be um and they just yeah I think that one might just be out of the range for this particular a P_D_A_ would they would makes a lot of sense for a P_D_A_ 'cause you're gonna be using it to connect up to things anyway but I dunno , what do you guys think ? 
UNKNOWN 'S too much . 
UNKNOWN For now . 
UNKNOWN Think we just need to come up with a nice black and red interface on the touch screen . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Nice . 
UNKNOWN That'd be okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh I I'm I'm in agreement with that , I'm wondering how we're gonna get uh we put fashion into electronics onto this device . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Well but if we're gonna use a touch screen where it's gonna come on like on your cell phone it'll have your your carrier provider name come up first like while it's loading and then it goes away , perhaps it could be like a temporary Comes on every time you turn it on and then that's it 'cause it is a bit much to have it like engraved on the back or something I think . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN True . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I'm hoping for a subliminal maybe half a millisecond as it turns on . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Y Yeah you would think . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah I know I d it seems like it would suffice to have just the R_R_ on there . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Jus But apparently not . 
UNKNOWN But . 
UNKNOWN If it comes from above . 
UNKNOWN People aren't gonna want their remote to boot up and to see flashing things come on . 
UNKNOWN So . 
UNKNOWN They just want it to be on and ready to go . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well fair enough . 
UNKNOWN Um and yeah that would help the battery life too and if it the remote they do have to press a button for the remote to turn on . 
UNKNOWN But then again who wants to turn on a remote control . 
UNKNOWN Well all you have to do is touch the screen and it automatically goes on . 
UNKNOWN Kind of if i Oh to wake up okay or go into like a dormant mode . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN Goes into a sleep mode . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Oh yeah I like that I like the idea of um putting the logo in the boot up screen , nice . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Um cool so any last things before we break ? 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
UNKNOWN Fair enough . 
UNKNOWN We're good ? 
UNKNOWN Sounds good . 
UNKNOWN I'm gonna save th a copyof this in case you guys need any reminders . 
UNKNOWN I'm gonna save a copyof this and the minutesthat I'll do it in a second and put them in the shared folder for later reference . 
UNKNOWN I've put my files in the shared folder as well . 
UNKNOWN Brilliant . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN That's fab guys . 
CONFIRMATION Cool . 
UNKNOWN That went well , thank you . 
UNKNOWN That's great . 
UNKNOWN Perfect . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN Alright , let me just PowerPointthis up . 
UNKNOWN Right so um this meeting will be about the conceptual design , don't ask me s precisely what conceptual design is , it's just something important that we need to do . 
UNKNOWN Um , think of it 's kind of uh turning the abstract into slightly more concrete . 
UNKNOWN In this meeting ideally we'll come to some final decisions on what we're gonna do for the prototype . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Right so um , apologies for the last meeting , it was brought to my attention that I did not make the roles clear enough , um , so I will attempt to do so more accurately in this particular meeting . 
UNKNOWN Um , fair enough , thanks for the input , 's always good . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN So , basically all we're gonna do is have some presentationsagain much like last time , um , and gonna go through you , uh whoever wants to go first is f fine by me um and we'll collate what we know about um what we discussed in the last meeting , possible directions . 
UNKNOWN And then we'll make some more decisions on um basic uh firm up our idea on how we want this remote control to look and work . 
UNKNOWN So , perfect . 
UNKNOWN So , without th further ado , whoever wants to go first is free to . 
UNKNOWN I'll go first . 
UNKNOWN Go ahead . 
UNKNOWN Alright Nathan , take it away . 
UNKNOWN It is Nathan right ? 
UNKNOWN I'm not calling you the wrong name over and over again ? 
UNKNOWN No Nathan's fine . 
UNKNOWN Good . 
UNKNOWN It's either Nathan or participant two . 
UNKNOWN Mister participant two that is . 
CONFUSION Uh . 
UNKNOWN Nice . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Nice . 
UNKNOWN Um , basically what I'm gonna have to talk to you about today is um component design and it's been brought to my attention that we may be somewhat limited as to what we can do because of what our manufacturer offers , so Basically what I'm gonna be doing is talking to you about that . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Um , components of a remote control , okay . 
UNKNOWN We've already kind of gone over this but we're gonna have to get into more detail and probably have to reach some conclusions some time soon . 
UNKNOWN Energy source , um , our manufacturer offers a variety of energy sources , your standard battery , solar cells . 
UNKNOWN Our manufacturer didn't say anything about lithium so we might have to look if we do go that route , we might have to look elsewhere . 
UNKNOWN Um , and also there's a kinetic energy possibility . 
UNKNOWN Basically , it's like a um the idea of moving the remote would create enough energy to keep it running . 
UNKNOWN So that's one possibility but I don't know whether that would be powerful enough to illuminate a touch screen . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN So we'll have to look into that . 
UNKNOWN Um , the case , we have a few options , plastic , rubber or wood . 
UNKNOWN Um and then as far as the way it's shaped , we can do standard boring flat , which we probably don't wanna do , curved or very sexy double curved . 
UNKNOWN What kind of th thickness are we looking at ? 
UNKNOWN Um , I imagine that we could specify . 
UNKNOWN Um , I don't see any reason to go outside of the convention of three or four millimetres . 
UNKNOWN Okay , brilliant . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um , the buttons , there are multiple scroll buttons available from our manufacturer , but to use those we'd have to use more chips , um and that would cost us more . 
UNKNOWN And if we do go with the rubber doubled curved case um we'll have to use rubber push buttons because the other buttons aren't compatible with that . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Um and just a little note there , touch screen equals many chips which equals many Euro . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Nice . 
UNKNOWN Um , one thing that I noticed was that most remotes operate on a infrare on the infrared part of the spectrum . 
UNKNOWN So you notice when you push a button on a remote you can't see anything coming out of it but in fact there is light coming out of the remote and you know the television can detect that . 
UNKNOWN And if you were to record if you were to make a video recording you could actually see the light . 
UNKNOWN Uh one thing that I thought might be interesting was to use part use visible light coming out of the remote , just kind of as a fun gimmick . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN So you could actually see something coming out of the remote when you pushed it . 
UNKNOWN Interesting . 
UNKNOWN Course it'd have to be a part of the spectrum that wouldn't damage the human eye or anything like that . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Good call . 
UNKNOWN M Maybe is there an option that we can have that off or on so a person can select like Yeah I like the idea , it's a good idea . 
UNKNOWN Choose it . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I am sure that we could do that . 
UNKNOWN Um , of course Yeah , just as a fun gimmick . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Just to set us apart a little bit . 
UNKNOWN Um , and then on to the circuit board that we're gonna use , also known as the chip . 
UNKNOWN Uh , we really don't have any way around the T_A_ one one eight three five . 
UNKNOWN Um findings , okay , we're very limited by what our current manufacturers can offer , um and my question to all of you is , should we look to other manufacturies or should we just make do with what we have available ? 
UNKNOWN Interesting question . 
UNKNOWN 'S a bit of a challenge question . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Well I'd say shop around but with our time constraints , is that really a feasible option ? 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Right , that's my concern too . 
UNKNOWN Um , if we do go the lithium battery route then we'll have to go outside our current manufacturer . 
UNKNOWN My personal preference is I'll just throw my cards on the table , uh I think we should probably go the solar battery route , just to kinda keep with the environmentally friendly theme that we have going on . 
UNKNOWN Uh , I like the idea of the visible light signalling , that's something to set us apart and uh I was thinking about I was thinking of ways that we could produce the remote in a variety of different case materials to suit different tastes . 
UNKNOWN So we're not so confined by one style and say some you know , say our the one if we just go with one and it doesn't go over well then we're in a bad situation . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Can we do marketing piloting too ? 
UNKNOWN Try to see what kind before we launch can we see how they're received ? 
UNKNOWN Um It's an option , uh but actually there's I've got some research already on like what we're looking at and trends in casing right now which actually might even come into play beforehand , it may help us decide for now . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Okay , perfect . 
UNKNOWN Great , thank you very much Nathan . 
UNKNOWN Temporarily anyway . 
UNKNOWN Oh yeah , you're welcome . 
UNKNOWN That's perfect , so I guess that makes sense for you to take it from here . 
UNKNOWN I guess so , 'cause I found some interesting things . 
UNKNOWN You waiting for me ? 
UNKNOWN Fascinating , compelling even . 
UNKNOWN Did you ? 
UNKNOWN I know , what a teaser ain't it . 
CONFUSION Um . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN So current market trends . 
UNKNOWN Screen . 
UNKNOWN Um , basically I was looking at what's going on in the remote control market right now and what's going on in other design fields , to see sort of what's what's trendy , what's new , what's happening . 
UNKNOWN Um , remote control right now basically everybody says they want newer , fancier , more exciting they're sick of this boring , normal , functional , um that we need innovative design options and there needs to be an easy user interface . 
UNKNOWN Um the challenge is that current trends right now , across the board in fashion , in furniture , in technology , is a very organic fruit and vegetable kind of thing . 
UNKNOWN Now I'm not saying we should have , you know , tomato shaped remote controls or anything , but I think it is possible maybe to use um natural colours , like if wood is an option , that whole organic , sleek , clean , v line thing may be something we can look into . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Different skin options , or if we can't afford this touch plate thing , or touch face screen interface um , maybe having the b images be specific , like you could choose your menu bullets to be a different shape or okay , not the example I would choose , but you know what I mean to t sort of and th apparently the feel of the next couple of years is spongy , uh not something I I've come up with a though if we can get around to getting piloting , I thought maybe a casing option like uh not like a skin , but like a holder almost if you could do like um , leather options or wood options or something Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Tomatoes . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN I like it , I like it . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN I should have mentioned this um . 
UNKNOWN As far as the rubber that we can use we can use a rubber as part of the case , it has a consistency of those stress balls . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Might be an interesting way to go . 
UNKNOWN Fabulous . 
UNKNOWN Slick , slick . 
UNKNOWN Um , yeah so something to sit on for now . 
UNKNOWN So overall I think we should stick with what we're finding , everyone's looking for easy to use , technologically innovative and this fancy new I think perhaps the double curve thing and maybe this rubber option is our best way to go for right now . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Interface , oh the interface graphics for the um Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Well I d but then if the touch screen thing isn't gonna work out for us that's really a non-issue . 
UNKNOWN I like the idea of of rubber too because it's tends to be associated with being durable , something that you can drop and it doesn't matter . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN True . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause so many you go to so many houses these days and you see broken remote controls . 
UNKNOWN Very true . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , it's like , yep it's ubiquitous isn't it ? 
UNKNOWN Very true . 
UNKNOWN Taped with duck tape and what have you , you wouldn't have that problem if you used rubber . 
UNKNOWN Very much so . 
UNKNOWN Um We could . 
UNKNOWN We can have a duck tape casing . 
UNKNOWN I think that goes against the whole fancy something , a new line , but worth a shot . 
UNKNOWN It could go with the granola crowd . 
UNKNOWN Ah , it could be , it could be , um . 
UNKNOWN Yeah that's what I know . 
UNKNOWN Great , thanks for that Sarah . 
UNKNOWN No problem . 
UNKNOWN Ron ? 
UNKNOWN Phew . 
UNKNOWN Computer's adjusting . 
UNKNOWN One moment please . 
UNKNOWN So interme interface concept by your faithful user interface designer . 
UNKNOWN So yur user interface , guys , is basically aspects of a computer system that we can see or hear , or otherwise uh perceive . 
UNKNOWN Uh , commands and mechanisms , that basically user uses to control the operator operating system . 
UNKNOWN Here's a d series of different remote controls that are out on the market today . 
UNKNOWN I think we're definitely trying to get away from this kind of a look . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um , so the following are a bunch of different uh interface uh concepts . 
UNKNOWN Uh voice recognition , we we um actually have some new uh information from our research design team but uh I'll get to that in a moment . 
UNKNOWN Um , so current voice recognition starts up to about eighty speech samples , um and basically you record your own verbal labels c and connect them to the remote control . 
UNKNOWN Now our design team , research team , has been able to uh set up a system in which uh you can teach the remote control voice c recognition system to respond to um with standard responses . 
UNKNOWN Like you could say good morning uh remote control and it'll say in a sexy female voice , Good morning Joe . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN In fact we already have this for a coffee maker line On the remote control right . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Lot of single people on the um on the re on the remote control research team at the Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Very true , very true . 
UNKNOWN Um , another concept is what uh Apple has come up with , the spinning wheel with uh L_C_ display like on the uh iPod which I am sure most of you know about . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Um and then we have the scroll button with integrated push-button , kind of like a modern a bit bulky , a bit crazy , I don't think that's we're necessarily going for . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN And uh some special components , uh ideas like uh blocking , having the ability to block channels from your for your children um and uh dedicated buttons for for commonly used uh channels and even uh ideas like secured or hidden programming but uh I again if we go with touch screen I don't think that's a big issue . 
UNKNOWN Um and uh this is kind of the uh the big daddy of remote controls here . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Uh the jumbo universal remote control is almost impossible to misplace or lose . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I can see . 
UNKNOWN Um , again probably not what we're going for so I I mean my ideas here and kind of where I think we're heading is something slightly larger than a regular iPod uh with a hard cla c uh plastic casing although I think some of the suggestions we've come up with are definitely uh very good ideas . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Uh changeable casings uh our design team was possibly talking about including one extra face plate with the package to kind of set the idea that you can change it and you can try changing it and kind of get used to thinking about maybe buying another one which can add value to our uh bottom line . 
UNKNOWN Mm , right . 
UNKNOWN Uh touch screen interface , um possibly having go-to buttons being uh stuck into the system so those don't move away from the screen , uh , the important ones like power , volume and jump between channels . 
UNKNOWN Um , and of course our voice command system which I've talked a little bit about already and uh the use of recognisable colours and shapes to aid recognition of the features um that are around so red for power , um arrows for different volume ups and downs and channels ups and downs and what not . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN And uh perhaps even adding in some stupid little jokes with the voice recognition idea like perh mm for instance my toastie maker that I got from my bank has jokes when it's ready . 
UNKNOWN Nice . 
CONFIRMATION Great . 
UNKNOWN And uh that is about it . 
UNKNOWN Great , wonderful Ron , cool . 
UNKNOWN Lot of good ideas , good facts to have . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN That's what they need , it's like a little dongle it just sticks up this further so you don't have to stand up every time , just connect it , my kingdom . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Right so , good to know all that stuff , thanks guys , um . 
UNKNOWN Now we kind of have to come to some decisions , um , I figure we can just go down the line and all three of us can have a chat about it . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Based on what Nathan presented as far as the um various costs and benefits um I think , I dunno , what do you guys think about the touch screen at this point ? 
UNKNOWN I think it's our most marketable feature just because it's so new and it's something that is showing up in other places . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN But can we really afford it 'cause it looks like they would be , that would be a really main cost source then right ? 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN My estimate is that in order to incorporate touch screen technology it's gonna cost us upwards of seventeen fifty Euro per remote , yeah that's just an estimate though . 
UNKNOWN To produce each one . 
UNKNOWN Per ? 
UNKNOWN Piece . 
UNKNOWN Oh you guys are always the dampers on these projects . 
UNKNOWN I know And our goal was to be under twelve fifty or we have to be under twelve fifty ? 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN You industrial designers . 
UNKNOWN I know . 
UNKNOWN It's fun . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Well . 
UNKNOWN Do we remember ? 
UNKNOWN I thought there was some flexibility with that . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN There is , it's just , it is a question of and how much ca o does that mean we're gonna have to increase the price to make money . 
UNKNOWN Can we justify it ? 
UNKNOWN Um , from twelve fifty if we d wanna get our fift uh hundred per cent profit margin um that would mean selling it from twenty five . 
UNKNOWN If you multiply seventeen fifty by two that's thirty five . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN So From the board , um , well That's true , I mean And that's to be fair the um the per cent of the market we're not going for mass any you know , mass sales anyway , we're gonna make I mean we we're not talking about selling eight zillion of these things , we just couldn't , not for twenty-five Euros , so we could probably maybe shrink the profit margins rather than selling for twenty five , sell 'em for thirty , but that's something that we can have finance deal with . 
UNKNOWN Where do you guys come up with these numbers ? 
UNKNOWN That's just off the top of my head , it is pending further emails . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Though I think that's what people would pay for , I mean if you're gonna pay for an expensive high class remote , you're gonna expect it to do something Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It is the new it would be in a class of its own . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um , I say that we provisionally go with the touch screen or wh y wh what was your thought on the matter Ron ? 
UNKNOWN I'm thinking that's uh definitely a good idea and I also think that we could probably come up with some sort of a cheaper uh means to to go about this kind of production , my my team in the uh on the third floor suggested that uh Yeah . 
UNKNOWN See if we can cut some corners . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Well and we can look into this other manufacturing option , and maybe we can get 'em somewhere else cheaper . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN It's true . 
UNKNOWN We could initially go with what we have and if we can find them cheaper later on Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN It's a starting point anyway , so . 
UNKNOWN No we could have a s very simple touch screen , you know , there's always the opportunity , if it's gonna be about the size of the iPod or whatever , you know , w we yeah , I guess we can play around with it a bit . 
UNKNOWN Alright , let's let's say that okay so the touch screen will be our um our main selling point here . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN I mean I think that we really have two main selling points , I think that our casing and the voice recognition To be honest , we have the capa we have the design in-house , I mean we've we've come up with this , with this new voice we're using it for our coffee machines already . 
UNKNOWN So The voice rec thing , I mean , if if we're looking at bottom line , now we're looking at upping the cost to seventeen to get the touch screen on , I think we might have to drop the voice rec . 
UNKNOWN Yeah 'cause with voice recognition I mean really this is pretty bells and whistles kinda remote . 
UNKNOWN I think we'd have to decide between 'em definitely . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Price-wise . 
UNKNOWN True . 
UNKNOWN We've already got it . 
UNKNOWN I can pass you on that emailfrom my uh guy in uh guy down the hall . 
UNKNOWN Sounds good . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN What do you think on it Nathan ? 
UNKNOWN About the voice rec ? 
UNKNOWN I think if we we do both the obviously production costs are going to go way up um but it does put it into it'd become the Rolls Royce of remote controls basically . 
UNKNOWN Pretty much . 
UNKNOWN It would be very nice . 
UNKNOWN I mean we we have to r reflect back on what our market research did say . 
UNKNOWN Right and they said they wanted voice recognition . 
UNKNOWN Course , maybe they hadn't thought of this whole touch screen option , but definitely we know the market is there for voice recognition so to say we have the technology and we're not gonna use it even though we know it'll sell is a call I don't think I can give the highs ups . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Like really I can't go in and say no we're gonna just ignore everything we know . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Does having both really up our costs ? 
UNKNOWN I can't see how it wouldn't , I mean , there's you know the old aphorism , you can have it fast , you can have it cheap or you can have it quality , pick two of three . 
UNKNOWN You know , you can't you can't have all three . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , 'cause you you just upping the number of chips that you need to deal with each different function . 
UNKNOWN It's just impossible . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well if we're gonna pick betwe e alright so we have to pick between one of the two . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Otherwise , yeah , we just it just becomes cost prohibitive . 
UNKNOWN What which , which do we suspect we should hold o we should hold on to ? 
UNKNOWN Well , we already have research backing voice recognition as you know fiscally solvent . 
UNKNOWN But uh I I I personally would tend to another direction but if that's what's gonna sell I think that's what we need to go with and maybe we can table this touch screen for our next model . 
UNKNOWN I would have to side with that , I think the voice recognition is simpler , we already have the all the technology in-house , it's ready to go , it's packaged , it's Um , this is just off the top of my head keep in mind , but I think the voice recognition would they're both mm they're both gonna push the costs up , but um , since we already have the technology in-house for the voice recognition we're not gonna have to do as much design work and sometimes the design work is what push the costs up , if you know what I mean . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN What does the cost look like Ron ? 
UNKNOWN Is it cheaper to do the V_R_ or to do the uh touch screen ? 
UNKNOWN Nathan ? 
UNKNOWN Well my p is Um , I definitely have to agree with that last comment . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
CONFIRMATION Right .
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN And we're still not then we don't have to deal with this battery issue nearly as much either , we can stick with what we've already got . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN In a lot other ways too . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So I'm getting alright so more or less you guys think that o o of the two of 'em , the voice recognition will be better . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN I think it's our lower risk option which for right now we can have it on the market sooner which is all in all our best option . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Sorted . 
UNKNOWN We will omit the touch screen in favour of voice recognition . 
UNKNOWN It's you and me outside a little here . 
UNKNOWN So and when are we gonna have basic prototypes coming up next that's you guys's next step right ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , well we'll we'll sic we'll sort out what it what f what else we're gonna talk about for the prototype but yeah that's our next step , it'll be a developing of prototype . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Are we going to talk now about um the materials that we're gonna use for the case and all those things ? 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN We'll just run through it yeah , yeah , um . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN You discussed either a lithium or a solar power . 
UNKNOWN Would the solar power be enough to fuel a voice recognition ? 
UNKNOWN Or this kinesthetic one , would that be enough to fuel a voice recognition remote control ? 
UNKNOWN Um , the solar power definitely would be but I think just to keep people from getting annoyed , 'cause sometimes solar power fails and there's no way round that , we should install a small backup battery . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Just to cover those moments when for whatever reason , the remote hasn't been exposed to It's true . 
UNKNOWN Well what of people with like the T_V_ in their basement , like what if wha we can't guarantee sunlight everywhere so having a secondary source is probably Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , it works about the same as a solar powered calculator , and you know how those those don't really require that much light , um , but obviously a little more light than a calculator , but we're not talking about a lot of light . 
UNKNOWN Calculator . 
UNKNOWN True . 
UNKNOWN True . 
UNKNOWN Doesn't have to be out taking a sunbath for a few hours a day or anything . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
CONFIRMATION Right .
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN What do you think Ron ? 
UNKNOWN I'm willing to agree with everything that's been said . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Uh I have to say though that um another idea's come up in my head . 
UNKNOWN If we're really not uh handling the remote control to a great extent we could possibly get away from the idea of having a hand-held remote control and maybe kind of have a round remote control that kind of looks like a paperweight or something like that , kind of a sleek little uh neat thing that sits on your table or something . 
UNKNOWN Uh Interesting . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Why , why moving away from hand-held , why ? 
UNKNOWN Just a thought . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN What's the uh idea ? 
UNKNOWN Well if you don't need to pick it up it could kind of be a selling point . 
UNKNOWN I if it's got voice recognition it can be technically anywhere in your room and still do its job . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Do you think people that are people that buy a remote , are they always gonna wanna use the voice recognition or is it just something that they do sometimes . 
UNKNOWN True , and i probabl I think we're banking on selling it to more than just voice recognition people , like we want it to work fundamentally as a basic manual too , right . 
UNKNOWN Well we have to have buttons on it too as well . 
UNKNOWN But that's done , that's no bother I mean if you look at the catalogue from places like with sharper image or whatever you know they might have or like um who is it , Apple makes these really pretentious speakers with the th sub-woofers you know like clear and glass and you know and then they got these little pyramidal type of um speakers . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I mean , why not have a little rounded kind of thing , it could still have the basic buttons on it . 
UNKNOWN Um , 'cause we're going for basic functionality primarily as well . 
UNKNOWN With the bu yeah . 
UNKNOWN And maybe a menu button and so forth , you know um use a channel button to scroll through the menu d if they want to record programmes or whatever you know I mean we can sort that out . 
UNKNOWN I think , I think you're on to something because we need to escape the traditional shape of a remote . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Maybe something that looks nice on a table is would be good , even though and hand-held the same time . 
UNKNOWN True . 
UNKNOWN Way to go . 
UNKNOWN I think it's all about following Apple's lead on a lot of these things . 
UNKNOWN Yeah I'm thinking of the airport portal , you know like that little pod looking thing ? 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , those are nice . 
UNKNOWN Exactly . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I mean a nice although we do um wh uh is I'm recalling that she mentioned that we n need to get away from the surgical white kind of brushed aluminium thing and get back to it but you could have a very tasteful um wood coloured or earth tone kind of um Still , I mean , yeah , along those lines . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN That would be kinda neat . 
UNKNOWN Terracotta bowl or something . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah I like that , I like that idea a lot . 
UNKNOWN Um , let's see what we can do as far as that goes . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN And the uh the material like the plastics and so forth , we were discussing that being uh using like a rubber kind of softer feel , um you know li lik if you feel the the tip on this pen it's a bit gives just a bit . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN You know something where it's uh a a more advanced f form of plastic that has some kind of a tactile response to it . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Just kind of the squishy feel . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , which is the next big thing , so that's not gonna hurt us either . 
UNKNOWN Mm 'kay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah let's see if we can do a squishy non-remote control-looking remote control . 
UNKNOWN But to be fair , yeah , I mean , you just c you could just put it literally put it on the the ni the coffee table next to the telly and say volume up . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Yeah I like it , I like the idea , that's good . 
UNKNOWN Handy . 
UNKNOWN Um and we've sorted of discussed costs , um . 
UNKNOWN I guess we'll a that's gonna be uh a thing , if we run a bit over-budget , that might be okay , um . 
UNKNOWN Sorry about the uh lack of information on cost , I just haven't been provided that information by our manufacturers and I'm just having to guess . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN We'll have more of an idea when the prototype have more of a we'll have more of an idea later on . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN And we just yeah go from there . 
UNKNOWN Um , so we've revisited the touch screen and more or less ruled that out , um , I think so we're more or less con we wh wh we're more or less in agreement that we want to have a um a simple kind of function , you know , not too complex . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Well when the majority of people are only using the most primary functions on a daily basis , although I'm not saying we should completely rule out major functions , they should be secondary , at least if not functionally then visually , like those shouldn't be Take precedence , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Like maybe have menu things . 
UNKNOWN If , if we're not going the touch-screen route then we can um just incorporate maybe something that folds out like what you often see on these kinds of remotes is the most basic functions up here and something that slidesdown to reveal the you know more complicated things . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN And they slide. 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN Well and do we wanna consider like an iPod screen which isn't a touch screen but you're still scrolling through menu options , in p True , we're still not making it easier then . 
UNKNOWN Think then we're hitting our cost issue again . 
UNKNOWN Yeah we've also got the the me the thing of , if we're gonna have a non-remote-looking remote , how do we yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN True . 
UNKNOWN Fair enough . 
UNKNOWN B But no I mean we could do a slideor a compartment , you know , like if it say it's a lit little vaguely ovoidal type of thing , it'd be easy to have a compartment in there . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Or you know , a b a b a a series of you know three or four buttons with a menu button and then a side an s up and down type of thing , like on um like on a D_V_D_ player . 
UNKNOWN You know you see the modern D_V_D_ players'll just have um a menu button on the side and then four buttons around them and you can just kind of manoeuvre through the menu like that . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah it's just a scroll . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So are we gonna are we talking we need to figure out what kind of buttons we're going to use , are we going to use scroll buttons ? 
UNKNOWN Rubber buttons ? 
UNKNOWN Um Right . 
UNKNOWN Well it seems like I dunno it seems to me that we could just do the um stick with the rubber 'cause since we're probably gonna be using some kind of um rubber for the outside case we might as well stick with that um . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Probably . 
UNKNOWN I think to a certain extent we have to stick with uh kind of uh a little bit traditional in terms of the buttons and then and then make our unique feature our casing and what not and our voice command . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Well no it's basic just like four directions that are that can use as menu or channel and volume or however you wanna do it , are really versatile and everybody's already got them to some extent on the remotes they already own so it's not like we're dealing with everybody relearning things 'cause that's not something anybody's gonna wanna buy a new for . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Mm 'kay , um . 
UNKNOWN We've already kind of covered this as well . 
UNKNOWN That seems to be selling um and we we've more or less agreed that we want to kar target this youth market , um . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Especially now with eighteen to thirty five year olds being such a large quantity of the population . 
UNKNOWN Right , particularly in technological fields , so that's exactly where we're headed . 
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm , mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Yeah alright , well , more or less covered what we need to cover I think fi an an any final thoughts before we think about doing the protot moving on to the prototype . 
UNKNOWN Well what are we actually doing ? 
UNKNOWN What were Sure . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN I was just gonna step on to um I wasn't ? 
CONFUSION Uh . 
UNKNOWN Oh it wasn't in the way but yeah , whatever . 
UNKNOWN Oh , my bad um sorry . 
UNKNOWN No , don't worry about it . 
UNKNOWN The um , yeah okay I was just gonna assign tasks in the next b anyth any oth any other final thoughts before we go ahead and cool ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So have we decided that we are gonna go with different style cases for different people ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Or are we just going to go with one ? 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN ..It's very , it's very hard thing to predict because you have different cases and that might open up your market a little bit obviously , but if you have just one case and it doesn't go very well mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN It's a tough situation , but obviously having more cases also costs more so There's an idea . 
UNKNOWN Well then again colours wouldn't be so hard to do , you could have uh a , you know , a um uh kind of a natural wood colour , like a stained wood and um , I don't know , olive green or something . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN That wouldn't be so much of a problem to incorporate into the colour of the thing . 
UNKNOWN And again copying iMac's kind of for iPod Mac Apple's uh colour scheme . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , get in there . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , totally . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I think that's probably a good id okay so let's work on uh multiple case colours . 
UNKNOWN But yeah , stick with the same kind of kinda yeah , the same basic non-remote kind of remote design . 
CONFIRMATION Cool . 
UNKNOWN Alright , so we'll have the next meeting about half an hour , um . 
UNKNOWN I want the uh I'd like Nathan , I'd like you to work on just the basic look and feel , what can we accomplish , um , given these parameters that we're just gonna sort of have this kind of uh non-remote remote . 
UNKNOWN Um , what are our broad constraints before we deve design a prototype . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN And um Ron if you can figure out how probably best to lay out this idea of this simple design with the voice recognition built in and also this kind of drop down or s on the side kind of menu options simple . 
UNKNOWN Somehow work out how we can get this all s in the same place . 
UNKNOWN Um , and if you can check product evaluation with m some pilots and stuff . 
UNKNOWN Um I need you guys to work together on making a prototype , um using um prototype building materials um . 
UNKNOWN And also um specific instructions will be sent to you by your coaches as well . 
UNKNOWN Oh excellent yeah . 
UNKNOWN So that's what to start with for now , is that alright , you guys feel clear about this ? 
CONFIRMATION Cool . 
UNKNOWN That sounds good . 
UNKNOWN Fabulous . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
UNKNOWN I guess we'll just hit the bricks . 
UNKNOWN Thanks guys . 
CONFIRMATION Cool . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Oh I totally Yeah 'cause I moved it . 
UNKNOWN 'S put it over here . 
UNKNOWN Then we don't have to worry about it . 
UNKNOWN Ready for this ? 
UNKNOWN All set ? 
CONFIRMATION Cool . 
UNKNOWN Alright , it is PowerPointtime . 
UNKNOWN I've done more PowerPoints in this particular experiment than I've ever done in my life before this experiment which is kind of fun . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Oh man . 
UNKNOWN So uh here we have our detailed design meeting where we will um look at the prototype and um right so um , I finally figured out what this whole second bullet point is about in my that my coach was sending to me . 
UNKNOWN It means I'm supposed to read the minutesfrom the previous meeting . 
UNKNOWN Oh really ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN I think . 
UNKNOWN Huh . 
UNKNOWN I don't know . 
UNKNOWN Otherwise it's just saying I'm the secretary and I'm therefore I'm taking the minutes, s so just to go um just real briefly to go over minutesfrom last meeting , uh , I will open them slowly , no ? 
UNKNOWN Wait for it , wait for it . 
UNKNOWN Yeah that's not you . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN That's how the Wait . 
UNKNOWN This is , this is very high-powered stuff here , double-clicking , there we go . 
UNKNOWN So um basically the moral of the story from our last minuteuh last meeting was that um we that we had meetings from uh we had presentationsdone by the Industrial Designer , uh or from Nathan , and Ron and from Sarah about what we can do here um and what sort of limitations we're operating with um uh excuse me what limitations we're operating under , what kind of risk we'd be looking at with some of the various approaches we were discussing and we essentially came to the conclusion that we should develop a remote with uh voice recognition , I_E_ that had a vaguely non-remote like shape um because you didn't really need to use it as a remote since you could just use your voice . 
UNKNOWN That would include some mostly just the simple design features for a television operation but with a slideor a fold-out bay for more advanced functions for users . 
UNKNOWN Um , and uh the uh uh the U_I_D_ and the I_D_ were asked to go ahead and start developing a prototype for us to look at . 
UNKNOWN So . 
UNKNOWN That's sorted , back to the main meet here , um , go ahead and take it away guys . 
UNKNOWN Well . 
UNKNOWN Uh , we have assembled our prototype , um . 
UNKNOWN What's to be said about it ? 
UNKNOWN Um , we took into account a lot of the things that we went over in the last meeting , um . 
UNKNOWN Some of the most important things to consider are that we decided not to go for the touch screen which you can see and opted for some very large buttons for the primary functions , um . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN This is going to be the on off button and we have these buttons to go through the channels um and then two volume buttons down here , d uh we decided those were the most important uh buttons . 
UNKNOWN And then , for the more advanced uh functions there is a slideout panel here um and you can see that there are lots of other things going on . 
UNKNOWN But this actually can slideback in and provides a very nice aesthetic when it's all put away , um . 
UNKNOWN As far as the uh whole visible light thing , we decided to go with the multiple colours coming out , why not ? 
UNKNOWN Ah . 
UNKNOWN Nice . 
UNKNOWN Fair enough . 
UNKNOWN Of course , if that's annoying for some people that function can be turned off . 
UNKNOWN Perfect . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN No it's important to we talked a quite a bit about uh you know the the interchangeable uh faces and what we've done here is come up with a bit of a natural look here um f we call it fruity if you will . 
UNKNOWN Go ahead . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Appropriate , okay . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Right , um , of course that's uh interchangeable and uh I think it would be desirable for the uh for the regular product in the in the in the in the first packaging to be something a little bit more subdued but this is kind of something that can be done um and as you can see on the television there uh we have the uh voice detector device um on the top there . 
UNKNOWN Mm 'kay . 
UNKNOWN It is an option . 
UNKNOWN Oh , right . 
UNKNOWN That's this here . 
UNKNOWN Ah . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN I see . 
UNKNOWN So that that will work quite well with with regard to finding this uh contraption . 
UNKNOWN Um , what other things do we see here , well , um if you give it a touch it does have actually a bit of a spongy feel , um , so I think that will work well with regards to our market . 
UNKNOWN Um and uh let's see , well clearly there's gonna be some more colours and what not available . 
UNKNOWN Um uh do you have anything else to add to that ? 
UNKNOWN Um I worried about the materials , it is uh the entire thing is covered in a rubber coating so it's very durable uh , it's not gonna break like some types of plastic that's dropped . 
UNKNOWN Um , and of course as you can see and if you touch it it does have that nice squishy feel . 
UNKNOWN It's actually important to note that the television , uh you know if there's an earthquake or anything like that , that i it actually is edible inside . 
UNKNOWN Fact , I dunno if you noticed , but I wrote the uh the company's name on the telephone screen , I thought that was kinda nice . 
UNKNOWN Oh well done yeah , yeah oh ok Edible televisions , it's a wave of the future . 
UNKNOWN Nice . 
UNKNOWN This was actually an apple on the inside . 
UNKNOWN Do we need to worry about um rot factors ? 
UNKNOWN This Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um it's encased in a new uh type of uh polymer yeah . 
UNKNOWN Oh okay , there's preservatives involved , we don't need to worry , okay . 
UNKNOWN It's fine . 
UNKNOWN We got a bit ahead of ourselves , I know we're not talking about making televisions at this point or anything like that , but Right . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Fair enough . 
UNKNOWN No but It's a couple years off at least . 
UNKNOWN It's pos a possible new product . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um , but I think that's I think that sums up the main features of our of the remote , um I dunno if you guys have any questions or f whether that uh whether we need to worry about any uh other marketing areas or anything of that nature . 
UNKNOWN Brilliant . 
UNKNOWN Um , did we come in under budget ? 
UNKNOWN Uh we did , yeah . 
UNKNOWN This cost well to put this into um production , we're looking at about what was our goal ? 
UNKNOWN It was twelve fifty Euro um and this actually came in at about eleven ninety nine . 
UNKNOWN Um , so I was quite pleased with that . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN One thing that we didn't do um obviously we had a choice with the buttons whether to use scroll buttons or standard rubber buttons , but we just went for a classic rubber button and um since we did that we didn't have to use as many microchips which was quite nice and that's what helped keep the cost down . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Brilliant . 
UNKNOWN So even though it has a lot of modern technology , um for example the voice recognition , in a lot of ways it's just a simple remote and um I think if we shopped around for other manufacturers um we might be able to get even cheaper . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Did we talk about the voice recognition uh option ? 
UNKNOWN And Oh no , we haven't talked about that yet have we ? 
UNKNOWN So uh so uh yeah on the back here you all noticed this area here which is actually the voice recognition uh uh console and uh I think it's nicely designed into the into the overall look . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um , but basically the voice recognition uh incorporates um the latest designsthat our research team has been able to cufw uh come up with . 
UNKNOWN Basically uh quite similar to the coffee maker um design that we were talking about earlier and um , I think that uh has given a proven um ease of use and what not . 
UNKNOWN Mm 'kay . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And uh allows features like the remote actually talking back to the user um , so . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
CONFIRMATION Cool . 
UNKNOWN Any questions ? 
UNKNOWN No , no I think that's Right , yeah thanks guys that's very , very good work . 
UNKNOWN Do we have um other , for lack of a better word , skins ? 
UNKNOWN Covers ? 
UNKNOWN In play now or are those ones gonna be developed later once we see how the couple we have g go or ? 
UNKNOWN Um , do you wanna answer this one or do you want me to answer it ? 
UNKNOWN Do we know where we stand on that yet ? 
UNKNOWN Well we didn't quite have enough material uh . 
UNKNOWN Oh I wasn't expecting a prototype I just didn't know if you guys had any in mind yet . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Oh I see , right , um . 
UNKNOWN Um , well as you can see this is just a most superficial layer and um it'd be very easy to put another layer of something else like It's not it's not quite a a face plate , it's more like a pseudo-face plate because it's simple enough that in the factory it could we could very easily put a different one on it , it locks into place such that , you know , it's pretty permanent but at the same time , if we wanna go the other way it's just a matter of a couple of adjustments and we could go the face plate way if you know what I mean . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Just veneer really , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Actually this bottom red ring here just unclips and then you put a a new a new uh a new plate on top of that . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN And the whole thing Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN So I mean there are I we definitely priced out a spongy even spongier non-natural look um materials which I think worked out fine . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN There's Okay . 
UNKNOWN We also continued on with the ideas that f following uh Apple's colour schemes with the kind of the uh light orange and the green . 
UNKNOWN Mm 'kay . 
UNKNOWN Okay , very cool . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN It's still an option if we need it . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Very cool , nice job . 
UNKNOWN I like it , brilliant . 
UNKNOWN Um , what we need to discuss now is the finance of it , um I got me you've got you provided a number that actually sounds quite nice . 
UNKNOWN Um the trouble is I was just given this by finance . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN Um , it's a spreadsheetof the parts and I've just tentatively put in what it's going to look like um . 
UNKNOWN Ooh . 
UNKNOWN I'm just gonna clear this out real quickly , but it looks like So we'll just if we can just itemize what's in here , we've got this it's a solar cell thing right ? 
UNKNOWN Right uh we didn't really touch on that but it it's in there , yep . 
UNKNOWN With a back-up battery ? 
UNKNOWN With the ba okay . 
UNKNOWN Um and Clever , clever , well done . 
UNKNOWN The voice recognition area actually doubles as uh as the solar cell area . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um so I guess that would mean we've got a bit of a um It's a s a speaker and a sensor at the same time isn't it ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah . 
UNKNOWN It's just making use of the same space and the same materials , but Yeah , one big curve I guess you could say . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um and the case , it's more of a single-curved case , I guess would be that be the general Um and we've got a rubber skin material basically throughout . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Push button interface um with this other drop-down so maybe we've got two push button interfaces don't we ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , mm-hmm . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN And um a special I guess it's uh we've got a sort of a wood materi a rubbery type material that throughout , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , special . 
UNKNOWN And s I guess you have to mark special colour and special form as well , don't you ? 
UNKNOWN 'Cause it i it is very unconventional , I like to think of it as unconventional . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , it's it's quite unique . 
UNKNOWN I like it , yeah it's So it looks like a bit over budget , um . 
UNKNOWN M come in at sixteen ? 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN Huh , doesn't match up does it ? 
UNKNOWN So what we could do perhaps , a simple fix would maybe to switch away from the solar cells um or take out the back-up battery . 
UNKNOWN How do you feel about that ? 
UNKNOWN Uh Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN I mean I think that uh if we're talking about it being one of our main selling features , being environmental and without the batteries and what not , although it does still have a battery so I'm not sure that you know what the sell is on that . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I mean we could take we could take the battery out of it you see and it'd probably work ninety nine per cent of the time but you're gonna have to set up a call centre for that one per cent of the time when people are calling and saying oh look my remote isn't working what am I gonna do ? 
UNKNOWN Mm k . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN People'd be real upset . 
UNKNOWN I think in the long-run it's better to keep the battery , it's hard to scrap the whole cell battery idea 'cause that's so integral to the theme that we have . 
UNKNOWN True . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN What's difficult , we have all these things integral to the um to the design of it that we just can't back out of now , it would have to be seems like we'd have to go back to square one in a way . 
UNKNOWN Nah . 
UNKNOWN Um if we were gonna try to undo one bit we'd probably have to undo most of it , um It's either or . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Although we don't wanna get rid of the whole environmental I mean obviously the solar cell is a big piece of the way we're marketing this as like a natural , new thing , but honestly if we cut that one piece out we're actually coming in under budget if I've done my math correctly . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN I mean you might be able to sway me on the idea that we our main selling point could be already this voice recognition thing I mean that's what sets us apart right ? 
UNKNOWN I mean Which , it's yeah that's what setting us into this young market , I mean that's where we started from , so I don't know , and I mean you know perhaps when the cell technology comes down in price we can bring that back into the game but it looks like at this point that may be out of our league . 
UNKNOWN And the reality is you know , for me from an ideological stand point , I'd like to stick with the uh the solar cell , but I h kind of have to throw myself in the in the business structure model here and uh you know I think I think that I think that we need to come to a compromise here and maybe move ahead with the project , without the solar cell . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
CONFIRMATION Right .
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think unfortunately that's our best option . 
UNKNOWN I guess we might have to do that . 
UNKNOWN It's the only way we're gonna get below our uh goal isn't it ? 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Of twelve fifty . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause we can't remove the push buttons 'cause they're um and we can't get rid of the uh I mean removing the changing the case wouldn't be so much of a mm-mm , um , nor would changing the case materials . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , . 
UNKNOWN It kind of yeah . 
UNKNOWN Savings . 
UNKNOWN Mm-mm . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN So yeah that looks like to be the only thing . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So that would be the it's a major change but Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Gotta do what you gotta do . 
UNKNOWN Alright , so we're in agreement on that . 
UNKNOWN Unfortunately I think we are . 
UNKNOWN No , I think that was a good compromise you brought forward Sarah . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Moving along swiftly . 
UNKNOWN Um , so I guess now we just go to the project evaluation which I will allow Sarah to take over . 
UNKNOWN That would be me . 
UNKNOWN Um cord ? 
UNKNOWN Ah of course , sorry . 
UNKNOWN No problem . 
UNKNOWN Whoosh . 
UNKNOWN Can you reach , that would be great , thank you . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN That'd be great Brilliant . 
UNKNOWN I didn't even do that one on purpose either , damn . 
UNKNOWN Okay , um , basically I was just evaluating um from what we know of how our product's working right now with the criteria that we set at the beginning of these are the things we needed to do , these are the things that look like we feel they're important . 
UNKNOWN Um so I was looking at basic design things , does it fulfil its functions as a remote ? 
UNKNOWN Is the design what we wanted it to do ? 
UNKNOWN I are technologies up to where we hoped they would be and does it fulfil the aesthetic qualities that our original market research was looking for ? 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Basic questions like , you know , does it turn on ? 
UNKNOWN Does it respond to voice recognition ? 
UNKNOWN And overall , in general , it looks like it's coming up to par . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Um , the only thing is with with the pull-out panel , that is , can it take some adjusting because it's a new sort of interface , um that looked like it was coming up rough , but then , once you get used to it , it does make a lot of sense . 
UNKNOWN So I think overall we're headed in the right direction . 
UNKNOWN Really good . 
UNKNOWN So . 
UNKNOWN They like that spongy feel . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It looks like it's going over well , so we're we're good yeah . 
UNKNOWN And the paging function works well , that's good to hear , we worked hard on that one . 
UNKNOWN Six ? 
UNKNOWN We did . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It's I think eventually if we do um branch out with this product maybe we do have a higher budget options and if it goes over with this model we can look into um wider range voice recognition like from other rooms of the house and stuff , but for now , what we've got is working in the range we need it for , so it's all good . 
UNKNOWN I am bit disappointed about losing the solar panel but it's okay . 
UNKNOWN That's everything from me . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , it is a set-back , but Okay , do you need the cord back ? 
UNKNOWN W we might have uh we might have lost that granola market again that we're I guess that's true . 
UNKNOWN Um yeah , I was just go on . 
UNKNOWN I know . 
UNKNOWN Well they don't own tellys anyway do they ? 
UNKNOWN True . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN So , um , this one's a bit unclear to me to be perfectly fair , um . 
UNKNOWN I got this slidefrom the coach and I'm not sure what it's connected to . 
UNKNOWN Um so I guess we are going to discuss um our project process um and that is gonna go into my report. 
UNKNOWN So I guess this is the point where we go um uh out of role it looks like and talk about our satisfaction for room for creativity and so forth and how that all worked , I guess , um . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN As in within the team or ? 
UNKNOWN I think so yeah . 
UNKNOWN Right so it's just kind of a open mic kind of thing or 'Kay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN I think it's I mm-hmm , I think so . 
UNKNOWN I think hope I'm not screwing up an experiment . 
UNKNOWN It is now , you're in charge so there you go . 
UNKNOWN But I trust that she would jump in if I was so okay fair enough . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Whatever . 
UNKNOWN Um right , um so any thoughts ? 
UNKNOWN Are we considering these points here ? 
CONFUSION Um . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN I think they're starting blocks yeah . 
UNKNOWN What do you guys feel about the process ? 
UNKNOWN Um , you know I think in general , for a day's worth of work we actually were relatively productive , considering the little amount of input we had going in . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um , and the technology has definitely been a help , it's really been interesting to try out all this new stuff . 
UNKNOWN We didn't use the whiteboard at all . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN No , no whiteboard . 
UNKNOWN No , we didn't . 
UNKNOWN We could now if that'd make up for it but really and I feel like if you guys had been designing in here perhaps that would have changed but because of room constraints , doesn't really matter . 
UNKNOWN And Um , also had I not been intrigued about the pen , I don't think I woulda used it at all , I didn't write barely anything . 
UNKNOWN Yeah I think I was taking notesmore often than usual just 'cause I liked the pen , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , it's true . 
CONFUSION Uh . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Was pretty cool tack though . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Definitely . 
UNKNOWN I am disappointed I didn't get a note back from my personal coach . 
UNKNOWN As you write your personal coach . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but I didn't get a response so we'll see . 
UNKNOWN What if you get a response two or three months from now ? 
UNKNOWN Okay that would be kinda creepy . 
UNKNOWN That'd be weird . 
UNKNOWN Attempts to contact coach ineffective . 
UNKNOWN Well what kind of coaching is that really ? 
UNKNOWN What if I really needed something . 
UNKNOWN I so I don't n I think there was a lot of room for creativity , we could do whatever basically what we wanted until the budget came down on us , um . 
UNKNOWN I think so . 
UNKNOWN And even then we did get a decent product turned out although it's not everything we wanted it to be . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN With the natural look . 
UNKNOWN That's very natural . 
UNKNOWN Very natural look . 
UNKNOWN Organic , really . 
UNKNOWN That's the brilliance of they had a p they had a peeler in here . 
UNKNOWN And highly resourceful team mates might I add which is always a plus . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I think , yeah re I thought it was like really creative actually , I mean . 
UNKNOWN Mm yeah , I'm impressed . 
UNKNOWN I think the teamwork was good as well . 
UNKNOWN And to prove that we weren't wasteful we didn't waste a single bit of Play-Doh , we used every bit . 
UNKNOWN Nice . 
UNKNOWN All four of those little containers . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I guess My one my one criticism is that we didn't have enough colours to work with , we only had four , wasn't enough . 
UNKNOWN Including the s the multi-coloured wave pattern . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN You could have developed multiple skins really had you had more colours . 
UNKNOWN I know it could have been amazing . 
UNKNOWN Oh well . 
UNKNOWN What did you guys think about the the the roles ? 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN They were good . 
UNKNOWN Yeah it's f kind of fun , it was I think it was pretty clever 'cause we were never able to get too far off track because the information came in at the right time and kind of filled in the gaps enough . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN True . 
UNKNOWN At the same time you had enough room to kind of just make things up , which was kind of fun . 
UNKNOWN Do your own . 
UNKNOWN Though I did feel like th the level of information dropped off severely over the course of the day . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I mean maybe it's just me but I didn't actually get any information for the last presentationat all . 
UNKNOWN That's true , I I got this spreadsheet. 
UNKNOWN Nothing , I didn't even get an email, like that was it . 
UNKNOWN So , yeah , I feel like that was slightly lacking but then you know , fill in the blanks on your own , level of creativity upped . 
UNKNOWN Well I think that was I think that was an issue I kept finding with regard to well no but also yeah when I was reporting about what each of us was doing I was often confused as to what you were doing um and then I also felt like you know a lot of our discussion would centre around n specifically what my task was because that was kind of the interface portion which was what the whole project was about uh but and then in the end I think our jobs kind of melded together a little bit more , which was fine . 
UNKNOWN Whatever . 
UNKNOWN Of what to do . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Uh-huh , that wasn't very much . 
UNKNOWN You know Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN Mm , mm . 
UNKNOWN Hmm , very much so . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN That was fun . 
UNKNOWN I think the most helpful thing out of everything was getting the the PowerPointslidesalready put together for you 'cause if we didn't have that there's no way we could have got all that done in time . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , already having the formatted stuff helped a lot . 
UNKNOWN Very much so . 
CONFIRMATION Cool . 
UNKNOWN And I think your leadership was quite good . 
UNKNOWN It was really good yeah . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN She said I I I she actually made a comment off boy you're getting into this and I really I think it's true I did get I I felt like I got way too into it . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN That's kind of a good thing though , you know , give the rest of us some structure to work with so hey . 
UNKNOWN I felt like I slipped into it a lot . 
UNKNOWN It's kinda fun . 
UNKNOWN I dunno . 
UNKNOWN An so is that the first time you've taken on that kind of role ? 
UNKNOWN The first time I've ever done anything like yeah project project management . 
UNKNOWN I usually organise crap , it's one thing to do , you know set up a party with your friends , you know ? 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Little different . 
UNKNOWN But you guys felt that you could keep the , yeah , suspension of disbelief kind of like like the role and the okay ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I except for a couple moments where it just got out of hand and I knew we were all lying through our teeth , other than that I could only imagine . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I had to admit , as soon as w we started I mean as soon as we got the Play-Doh , th you know the whole concept of really trying to stick with reality went out the window . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Maybe in in Legos you know ? 
UNKNOWN Possibly . 
UNKNOWN Be fun with Legos too , like make a remote control or spaceship , we used to have spaceship Legos did you guys ever used to build spaceships with Legos everybody knows best spaceships ever . 
UNKNOWN Oh yeah , still have 'em . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Totally . 
UNKNOWN Um you guys felt like there was enough teamwork in all ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah ? 
UNKNOWN I think so . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN You don't . 
UNKNOWN No I , no I dunno , I d I I dunno , I don't I I was just I It's true huh ? 
UNKNOWN Though we didn't actually I mean other than minor discussion at meetings there wasn't except for the actual building , but I feel like if this was a team project there actually would have been much more of the collaborative like brainstorming , use the board well and this would have been six months' worth of work , not like three hours' worth of meetings . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I mean I think had the issue been more serious we probably woulda brainstormed more during our meetings as a team . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN That's true . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Course I'm I'm conscious of the idea of the Project Manager asking if you guys feel like there's a team you know it's like , kind of like , like hmm . 
UNKNOWN It d But yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah that is kind of Mine was the mics . 
UNKNOWN Interesting . 
UNKNOWN It's kind of fascinating wasn't it ? 
UNKNOWN I mean the whole process of I don't know . 
UNKNOWN Wonder why is there anything about the way that we got so much inform what was it that kept us from going to the the board ? 
UNKNOWN I I don't know if there was a ri I th Mm . 
UNKNOWN I didn't feel like getting up and down and dealing with all these wires , I was afraid I was gonna break something actually . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's it 'cause the mics are loose and each time you get up it's s a possibility of tripping over something or getting tangled or . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well I dunno what I woulda shown on that board . 
UNKNOWN True , but it didn't even occur to me as an option , I mean I don't know that I would have but I know that I consciously didn't . 
UNKNOWN Nor I . 
UNKNOWN I mean it's just like the paperI don't know what I really needed the paperfor . 
UNKNOWN True . 
UNKNOWN Um , because I've got this laptop . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Standard , I just used it 'cause it's literally right in front of me . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I wanna see the output files from these um , from the digital paper. 
UNKNOWN Well it looks really professional . 
UNKNOWN I wanna see wh wh what my my handwriting looks like digitized because my handwriting is crap . 
UNKNOWN I know . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's it . 
UNKNOWN I mean , just to see what it looks like in P_D_F_ format or something . 
UNKNOWN Usually I would do a lot more doodling too but I didn't because New ideas . 
UNKNOWN I know , I felt like I needed to be professional so I didn't like drawall over my paperand stuff . 
UNKNOWN Okay , well not entirely , but still , I doodled less than I usually do . 
UNKNOWN T I I'm curious about what the de-briefing is gonna be like . 
UNKNOWN You know , like what is the uh what exactly we're looking for here . 
UNKNOWN So is this all we need to get through ? 
UNKNOWN I dunno , I'm not sure what the new ideas found i is about . 
UNKNOWN I guess . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN It did it just say in an emailthat we need to discuss that ? 
UNKNOWN Is it Any new ideas with regard to remote control concepts ? 
UNKNOWN Well , that's the thing I got i in the emailI got this PowerPointfilebut this slidewas just there , mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN That slidewas like that ? 
UNKNOWN I didn't change this one at all . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Well . 
UNKNOWN Um ch Yeah well . 
UNKNOWN I guess we're on the right track . 
UNKNOWN W I kinda like th Yeah you can't Yeah . 
UNKNOWN No , none . 
UNKNOWN Uh I think they still do their job . 
UNKNOWN I think they're fine actually . 
UNKNOWN I am thinking outside the little square box though , with literally in like form I don't Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , maybe a s a circle would be alright , different . 
UNKNOWN Does kinda make you wonder , I mean , how much can you do with a remote control ? 
UNKNOWN It's like inventing a new car . 
UNKNOWN Yeah yeah , you can Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It's still gotta be technically car shaped or it won't fit on the road , you know ? 
UNKNOWN Don't know . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN What is that ? 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN Our limited ability to think outside the box ? 
UNKNOWN Kind of . 
UNKNOWN So this was other costs . 
UNKNOWN Are we back into project mood ? 
UNKNOWN I dunno . 
UNKNOWN I think this is forty ish I I I mm we should go on a bit yeah about the project eval , um . 
UNKNOWN Oh , how long was our meeting supposed to be ? 
UNKNOWN How much time do we have left ? 
UNKNOWN I dunno about you guys but I felt like a bit under-stimulated on the whole thing . 
UNKNOWN Like , what like you know what am I really doing , you know what is Yep . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , at the beginning it started out and I felt actually like under pressure like the first couple were taking a lot of work and I was like had like all this brainstorming I was doing and then suddenly I was like well it's just another two minute presentationthat you guys don't really care about anyway so type away . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Why ? 
UNKNOWN Hey . 
UNKNOWN Huh I think it was the real . 
UNKNOWN You know , you know what I mean like we all sort of knew where we were headed with it so it didn't feel like it mattered anymore . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Definitely when when I first filled out the questionnaire I was marking it probably higher in terms of how much I had to how much I stressed over it and then by the time I got to the last one I was like , you know , not very much . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Whatever . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Think it was also realisation of you basically just copyand paste what's given to you into your presentationwhich uh wasn't so clear to me at the beginning . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Very much , yeah . 
UNKNOWN I actually didn't do that at all though , every single one I a all the presentationsI either added slidesor edited 'em . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN I di Oh . 
UNKNOWN Oh I added like five slidestoo , but I Yeah , mine too . 
UNKNOWN See I only got blank ones . 
UNKNOWN Did you really ? 
UNKNOWN I just got blank ones and Me too . 
UNKNOWN What ? 
UNKNOWN Really ? 
UNKNOWN My slideswere all blank , they'd have a title maybe and they were just empty . 
UNKNOWN Did they not have they didn't like uh mine yeah they didn't come like this ? 
UNKNOWN Like with this was what it looks like . 
UNKNOWN Like with those words already on it ? 
UNKNOWN This is what that looked like , literally , just like that . 
NEGATION No . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN Interesting . 
UNKNOWN I wondered why yours always looked so more complicated . 
UNKNOWN Uh-huh huh huh . 
UNKNOWN I deleted slides. 
UNKNOWN I think I added a slideone time . 
UNKNOWN I added many slidesevery time Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Hey with the whole new background being innovative , yeah that was class . 
UNKNOWN That was pretty cool , it was a high moment of the whole experiment . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Interesting . 
UNKNOWN Any other thoughts come to mind ? 
UNKNOWN I wanna know how our product would fare . 
UNKNOWN I can't just leave it there . 
UNKNOWN I think it would fail , I think it'd be a huge disaster , especially if it looks like that . 
UNKNOWN I think it would take extensive marketing , okay , an apple with a red button on top , even I am sceptical . 
UNKNOWN But you know the whole Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Even you . 
UNKNOWN I don't we kind of designed it to look little bit like a face . 
UNKNOWN I know it is . 
UNKNOWN Yeah but Builds . 
UNKNOWN It's a happy face . 
UNKNOWN Actually that looked a lot more like a tongue from previous to uh fr some other design uh modifications . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN I hope you appreciate the uh incorporation of some tin foil from a uh random Kit-Kat bar that happened to be consumed . 
UNKNOWN I I noticed that . 
UNKNOWN By accident . 
UNKNOWN Interesting . 
UNKNOWN Well huh . 
UNKNOWN An interesting day all in all I would say . 
UNKNOWN Uh , yeah , I'd say so . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , it's uh I wanna see a Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So again I reiterate my question of how different we are comp compared to the other groups , especially between culture groups and what not . 
UNKNOWN I know . 
UNKNOWN Mm , I know . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN It seemed like everything flowed pretty logically . 
UNKNOWN I Yeah . 
UNKNOWN You know from the the the basics to the conce although the whole concepts thing , the whole concepts phase , I don't think I really understood like the concept . 
UNKNOWN Well the id okay the notion of yeah I mean i it's not like I have a concept of a mug's material , it's just it is what it is . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause it's such a functional item . 
UNKNOWN You know , maybe i rather than concepts i it should be th thought of we sh I I thought of I thought of rather than in terms of concepts I thought of it in terms of um like proposed idea . 
UNKNOWN And then the final would be like th the actual specified prototype or whatever , I dunno . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN But . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN All in all it's kinda interesting . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN So we have more slidesor ? 
UNKNOWN No just this closing one . 
UNKNOWN No we've established that the costs weren't really within budget , but we could s you know do it We did the project evaluation based on um Sarah's evaluation of on off switches and Mm . 
UNKNOWN We got it to be . 
UNKNOWN Like cutting corners . 
UNKNOWN Kind of , though it was really technically an evaluation of the product , not the project in general . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Which I'm not sure is the same thing , at the time that just i made more sense , but I could see if they were really asking about us . 
UNKNOWN True . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause we di we had a thu think about it . 
CONFUSION Um . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And it's all recorded , woo-hoo . 
UNKNOWN Yay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah what I'm gonna I'm gonna put um I'm supposed to do this final reportthing at the end so I'll put all that into the final reportas well , or as much as seems like maybe not like the articles and stuff , like because and if and so forth , but I'll put most of it in the reports . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN I It'd be so cool if we get a copyof the recording . 
UNKNOWN Make it sound eloquent . 
UNKNOWN Oh , I have to done I've I've done transcription before and it's really ridiculous how many words people say like just in the middle of their sentences like that that mean nothing . 
UNKNOWN Nice . 
UNKNOWN Oh yeah . 
UNKNOWN There's a whole branch of psychology that looks into that , psycholinguistics . 
UNKNOWN What the uhs and the Mm . 
UNKNOWN Really . 
UNKNOWN There's a guy studying it here , yeah , he's studying ums and ahs or something . 
UNKNOWN Filler words or ? 
UNKNOWN Yep , they're called um disfluencies . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Disfluencies . 
UNKNOWN That's a good word for it . 
UNKNOWN Yeah we like our fancy phrases and terminologies for things . 
UNKNOWN Just add some prefixes , sounds classier . 
UNKNOWN Exactly uh I will save this into the project documents. 
UNKNOWN I find myself hitting the send and receive button on the emaila lot , just out of boredom , like c come on gimme something . 
UNKNOWN I , yeah , pretty compulsively during meetings , like , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Oh yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah I know . 
UNKNOWN Come on give me some information . 
UNKNOWN Well to be fair we're we're hooked we're all hooked on the internet , so I mean I do the I know , imagine we went the first ten y fifteen years of our lives without the internet . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , we are addicts . 
UNKNOWN That's scary yeah ? 
UNKNOWN It is scary . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Well just around that eight or or nine people that are Dude , I think we've had internet for like eighteen years . 
UNKNOWN It's only in the last ten that we're like where's the internet ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I mean , you know , it just in the past five we've gone from twenty eight eight modems to broadband all the time . 
UNKNOWN I yeah . 
UNKNOWN True . 
UNKNOWN No we have but I not in the sense that it's so un you know uh ubiquitous Mm . 
UNKNOWN I yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But it's not regular I mean my grandparents had it in the eighties and I got it in ninety four , but still . 
UNKNOWN It's crazy . 
UNKNOWN Uh-huh . 
UNKNOWN So Should . 
UNKNOWN In the eighties ? 
UNKNOWN My um grammy does computer science back in the States and so they had um an E_D_U_ and gov network . 
UNKNOWN There's basically the fundamental structures , but it wasn't uh household to household yet because it hadn't been partitioned off and stuff , yeah that was him . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Yeah , it was to the like seven universities or something . 
UNKNOWN You guys ready to celebrate ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah that's our last step . 
UNKNOWN Apparently , does that include like champagne or something exciting ? 
UNKNOWN Celebration . 
UNKNOWN I think so . 
UNKNOWN 'Kay I guess we can probably call that meeting to an end for the most part . 
UNKNOWN I think that's a closer . 
CONFIRMATION Cool . 
UNKNOWN Has it been forty minutes or whatever ? 
UNKNOWN this has been long enough . 
UNKNOWN Celebrate . 
UNKNOWN Where do you find that ? 
UNKNOWN I have no idea . 
UNKNOWN Is that the only song you have ? 
UNKNOWN There is another one . 
UNKNOWN Is this one of those media player ? 
UNKNOWN Huh ? 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN W oh . 
UNKNOWN That's awesome . 
UNKNOWN The default track . 
UNKNOWN Maybe I have a different one . 
UNKNOWN I thought it was David Burns , look into the eyeball . 
UNKNOWN That's one that seems to be shipping with it uh shipped with for a while , maybe this is the new version . 
UNKNOWN So is that a close ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I guess we'll call that a a doner . 
UNKNOWN Okay , that's the end of the meeting . 
UNKNOWN Fab . 
THANKS Thank you gentlemen . 
UNKNOWN I feel like I'm signing off . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Hi everybody and welcome to our kick-off meeting um for our new product that we're gonna be designing . 
UNKNOWN Um I'm Mandy and I'm the Project Manager . 
UNKNOWN And I know all your names again , Courtney , Fenella and Amber . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so first let's go through this PowerPoint. 
UNKNOWN I wonder what button I press ? 
UNKNOWN Just do it on the arrow . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , or how about I just click ? 
UNKNOWN Okay , here is our agendafor this meeting . 
UNKNOWN Um we're gonna start with our opening which was our introductions . 
UNKNOWN We're gonna get to know each other a little bit better . 
UNKNOWN Um tool training , we're going to , I guess , figure out what to do on this project with our individual roles . 
UNKNOWN Um we're gonna make a project plan and then have some time for discussion and close up the meeting . 
UNKNOWN Okay , here is our project . 
UNKNOWN We're gonna make a new remote control that's um original , trendy and also user-friendly . 
UNKNOWN And how we are going to do it is each of us is going to um We're gonna have discuss the functional design first , how is it gonna be used , what's the actual goal here , it has to operate T_V_ , blah blah blah . 
UNKNOWN And we're going to do individual work on that and then meet . 
UNKNOWN Same thing with conceptual design . 
UNKNOWN Just the basic overview of the project and then we're going to do individual work , meet . 
UNKNOWN That's pretty much the the whole process for today . 
UNKNOWN And then the detailed design , just more in-depth , get the actual schematics of the remote . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
UNKNOWN First we're gonna start off by using our tools . 
UNKNOWN And the whiteboard thing , do you guys wanna give that a try even though the ink wasn't working or do you wanna do it on here . 
UNKNOWN I think we should forgo the whiteboard since we can't actually see what we're writing . 
UNKNOWN We could Yeah , we could on here . 
UNKNOWN Alright , let's go forward then . 
UNKNOWN Um right now so we're all gonna drawour favourite animal and then sum up our favourite characteristics of that animal . 
UNKNOWN Even if you are not a good drawer like me . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
UNKNOWN Artistic skills , nil . 
UNKNOWN Fine . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Bless you . 
UNKNOWN Oh , thanks . 
UNKNOWN I drawlike I'm in grade five . 
UNKNOWN Oh do I . 
UNKNOWN 'Kay , about one more minute. 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN And who would like to start us off ? 
UNKNOWN I'll go . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
UNKNOWN Um this is my picture . 
UNKNOWN I drew fish I like fish , because uh , you know , their whole water-vascular system thing . 
UNKNOWN It's pretty cool , and um they've got a pretty good habitat and they are pretty sometimes , sometimes vicious but that's okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Only if they're piranhas . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , they they're easy , you know . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
UNKNOWN Who wants to go next ? 
UNKNOWN I'll go . 
UNKNOWN I drew a kitty . 
UNKNOWN It's pretty much impossible to tell that's a cat , but I love cats . 
UNKNOWN No I I see it . 
UNKNOWN No , I kne I knew . 
UNKNOWN No , it looks like a cat . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , it does look like a cat . 
UNKNOWN I love cats because they're independent , uh they pretty much know what they want , they get it , they move on . 
UNKNOWN I love cats , too . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I'm a cat person . 
UNKNOWN I'm allergic to cats . 
UNKNOWN Ah . 
CONFUSION Uh . 
UNKNOWN I'm allergic to cats , too . 
CONFIRMATION Oh , okay . 
UNKNOWN If you're around one I had a roommate who was um allergic , but if she was around my cat forever she became used to it , you know , it's weird . 
UNKNOWN In my next life . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah , if you're around them for a long period of time Oh , yeah , this summer I , oh I had to live with cats . 
UNKNOWN I still can't sleep with them in my room . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN It was crazy . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay , Fenella ? 
UNKNOWN Um , I drew a badger . 
CONFIRMATION Cool . 
UNKNOWN Yay . 
UNKNOWN Badger . 
UNKNOWN Well , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Good choice . 
UNKNOWN Why a badger ? 
UNKNOWN Uh I dunno , they're grumpy and nocturnal and Well , a little bit like the Yes . 
UNKNOWN Are you trying to suggest something ? 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN And then , if you know Wind in the Willows badger . 
CONFIRMATION Oh , okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah and then uh I don't know if you know Brian . 
UNKNOWN He's Liverpudlian writer . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
UNKNOWN Um , that kind of books . 
UNKNOWN Badgers are cool in that one too . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN And I'm last . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN Look at my sad sad giraffe . 
UNKNOWN No , that's good . 
UNKNOWN No , no , no , it ends up looking like some kind of a dinosaur , but whatever . 
UNKNOWN I don't know even much about giraffes , but I just love the way they look . 
UNKNOWN They're just such odd creatures , you know . 
UNKNOWN I I like that they're so unique and individual , I guess . 
UNKNOWN I don't know much about their behaviour or anything , though . 
UNKNOWN Only seen a couple in zoos . 
UNKNOWN You don't really have to , I mean , if you like 'em Right . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but you can appreciate the way they look . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
UNKNOWN Guess we're getting straight back into business here . 
UNKNOWN Um the selling price for our remote is going to be twenty-five Euro , and our profit aim is fifty million Euro . 
UNKNOWN We're going to make this an international product marketed in the States , in Europe , in Asia . 
UNKNOWN And um our production cost to make that profit is gonna be a max of twelve fifty Euro per remote . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So we're gonna talk for a little while . 
UNKNOWN Um here are some topics that we might be able to discuss . 
UNKNOWN Expe our experiences with remote controls um , our first ideas about this new remote , anything that you can bring to the table for this project . 
UNKNOWN So . 
UNKNOWN Now ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN You wanna start us off ? 
UNKNOWN Anybody have anything to offer ? 
UNKNOWN Well , we wanna make a multifunctional remote , right ? 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN One remote for everything . 
UNKNOWN And everything being Wait , we have what , sound system , T_V_ , D_V_D_ , V_H_S_ , uh TiVo ? 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN I think they'll be phasing V_H_S_ out shortly . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , TiVo . 
UNKNOWN TiVo . 
UNKNOWN But it's still there , so if po if we're gonna do it Or if it's not like a Sony , if it's like a I don't know . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN It needs to be compatible 'cause universal remote controls are never universal . 
UNKNOWN They're never universal . 
UNKNOWN That's right . 
UNKNOWN Esp e especially if you buy a a not big product , D_V_D_ player , say , usually it doesn't work if it's not one of the Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Something from Sam's club . 
UNKNOWN So we'll have to figure it how to cover all the different variances in signals . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And what we need an insanely good instruction booklet , because you always have to reconfigure all your contraptions to go with the remote anyways . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN 'Kay , and um another thing that I think is important is the d the design of the product , how it feels in your hand . 
UNKNOWN If it's just flat and kind of boring th those don't Nobody wants to buy those any more . 
UNKNOWN They want the ergonomic ones . 
UNKNOWN They want like the flashy lights . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Oh like this came from Las Vegas . 
UNKNOWN Ones that ones that look high-tech , too . 
UNKNOWN But at the same time are simple . 
UNKNOWN Mm yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN So that people like my mother can use it . 
UNKNOWN What about something with the curvature like that matches the curvature of a hand ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN Anybody have any experiences with remote controls that they can remember that Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Just bad ones . 
UNKNOWN That's true . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN What kinda battery would we want to use ? 
UNKNOWN Because battery changing is usually Okay . 
UNKNOWN D Double A_ . 
UNKNOWN Double A_ . 
UNKNOWN Do some of them use triple A_s though ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah some use triple A_s . 
UNKNOWN Some but Yeah , I guess then it's If we need to do triple A_ we can , but most people usually have double A_s around . 
UNKNOWN So double or triple ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But that has to do with the size of it too . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well , w as long as we know that issue is Here we can Triple A . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , if we want it to be more thin , then we'd probably wanna go with a triple A_ . 
UNKNOWN Can you with a small lithium battery ? 
UNKNOWN But it's okay , we don't have to decide about it now , just as long as we remember battery type and size is important . 
UNKNOWN Hey . 
UNKNOWN Anything else ? 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
UNKNOWN Moving along . 
UNKNOWN Oh , we're closing the meeting . 
UNKNOWN Next meeting is gonna start in thirty minutes . 
UNKNOWN Here's what we're going to do . 
UNKNOWN Um the I_D_ , which is who ? 
UNKNOWN Okay , you're going to think about the working design . 
UNKNOWN What do you think that means ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN And U_I_D_ , the technical fun functions design , making sure it does everything that we need the remote to do , the functionality of it , operating all those different things . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN And the marketing person , that's Courtney , is going to do the user requirements specification . 
UNKNOWN I guess that means specifying um what exactly the user is going to be looking for . 
UNKNOWN Right ? 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN I would think so . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN And you're gonna get more specific instructions emailed to you in just a little while . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so does anybody have anything they wanna say before we close the meeting ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN This meeting is officially over . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um welcome to our second meeting . 
UNKNOWN This is the functional design meeting . 
UNKNOWN And I hope you all had a good individual working time . 
UNKNOWN Okay , let's get started . 
UNKNOWN Okay , here's the agendafor the meeting . 
UNKNOWN After the opening um I am going to fulfil the role of secretary , take the meeting minutes. 
UNKNOWN And we're gonna have three presentations, one from each of you . 
UNKNOWN Then we're gonna discuss some new project requirements . 
UNKNOWN Um gonna come to a decision on the functions of the remote control . 
UNKNOWN And then we're gonna close up the meeting . 
UNKNOWN And we're gonna do this all in about forty minutes . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN First I want to discuss the goals of this meeting . 
UNKNOWN First we need to determine the user requirements and the question that we can ask ourselves is what needs and desires are to be fulfilled by this remote control . 
UNKNOWN And then we're going to determine the technical functions , what is the effect of the apparatus , what actually is it supposed to do , what do people pick up the remote and use it for . 
UNKNOWN And then lastly we're going to determine its working design , how exactly will it perform its functions , that's the whole technical side of 'Kay I'll just give you a minute , 'cause it looks like you're making some notes. 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN Oh , well let's go ahead and , back , previous . 
UNKNOWN So what I wanna do right now is hear from all three of you , on your research that you just did . 
UNKNOWN Who would like to start us off ? 
UNKNOWN I don't mind going first . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um do you have a PowerPointor no ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , it's in the should be in the m Project . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Do you want us to do our PowerPoints now or I can go . 
UNKNOWN You know you could you could do it yourself actually . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN Did you send it ? 
UNKNOWN Save it in the project documents. 
UNKNOWN Put it in Project Documents, yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Mm-mm-mm . 
UNKNOWN This one ? 
CONFIRMATION Sure . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Great . 
UNKNOWN Um well , the function of a remote control , as what uh we've been informed , is basically to send messages to the television set , for example , switch it on , switch it off , go to this channel , go to channel nine , turn the volume up , etcetera . 
UNKNOWN Um some of the considerations is just um for example the what it needs to include it's the numbers , you know , zero to nine , so you can move to a channel , the power button on slash off , the channel going up and down , volume going up and down , and then mute , a mute function . 
UNKNOWN And then functions for V_H_S_ , D_V_D_ , for example , play , rewind , fast-forward , stop , pause , enter . 
UNKNOWN And enter would be for like , you know , the menus . 
UNKNOWN And then other menus for D_V_ as well as T_V_ , whether that means like um we can go and decide the brightness of the screen , things like that , all the more complicated functions of menus . 
UNKNOWN And we can decide if that's what we want , , um if we want to include that on the remote , if that's something that would stay on the T_V_ itself , for example . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN These are two examples . 
UNKNOWN Um and you can see on the left , it's got a lot more buttons , and I don't know if you can read it , but it says , step , go to , freeze , um slow , repeat , program , mute , and so those are some of the buttons and so it gives you an idea of s one example . 
UNKNOWN And then on the right , it's a lot more simpler , it's got volume , it's got the play the like circle set , which is play , rewind , but it's also what is fast-forward is also like next on a menu . 
UNKNOWN So you have functions that are d uh duplicating . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN And you have a mute button and then the numbers and the eject , and the power button . 
UNKNOWN So that gives you two different kinds , a more complex and more simple version . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Ready . 
UNKNOWN And then lastly , it's just the questions that we want to consider like what functions do we want it to include , and how simple , complex it should be ? 
UNKNOWN And what functions it needs to complete . 
UNKNOWN Uh , what are needed to complete insulation process , 'cause , you know , that's something that also has to be considered and it's gonna be hopefully a one-time thing , when you set it up it should be set to go , but we have to include the functions that can allow it to set up i in the first place . 
UNKNOWN So that's it . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
UNKNOWN Very good presentation. 
THANKS Thank you . 
UNKNOWN You speak with such authority on the matter . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Left . 
UNKNOWN Who would like to um follow that one up ? 
UNKNOWN Now , that we've discussed Okay . 
UNKNOWN Do you want me to run it or you wanna Okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , you should run it . 
UNKNOWN Functional requirements . 
UNKNOWN Mm yes . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
UNKNOWN Now we have Courtney with the functional requirements . 
UNKNOWN Yes , okay so we tested a hundred subjects in our lab , and we just we watched them and we also made them fill out a questionnaire , and we found that the users are not typically happy with current remote controls . 
UNKNOWN Seventy five percent think they're ugly . 
UNKNOWN Eighty percent want they've are willing to spend more , which is good news for us um if we make it look fancier , and basically w we just need something that really I mean there's some other points up there , but they it needs to be snazzy and it but yet simple . 
UNKNOWN So that's really what we need to do . 
CONFUSION Wait .
UNKNOWN And we need we need it to be simple , yet it needs to be high-tech looking . 
UNKNOWN So Like They like I guess use the buttons a lot . 
UNKNOWN And that meaning what ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I don't know . 
UNKNOWN It's from my uh research . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Okay , what do you m Oh , I'm sorry . 
UNKNOWN My team wasn't very clear . 
UNKNOWN Only use ten percent of the buttons . 
UNKNOWN That's okay . 
UNKNOWN What do you mean by um the current remote controls do not match well with the operating behaviour of the user , like they have to press the buttons . 
UNKNOWN I I think it's like the engineering versus user , whereas like the engineering she showed that the engineering ones are more complex and users don't really need all of the buttons that are contained on there , because they only use ten percent of the buttons really . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Oh , right . 
UNKNOWN The buttons . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN We only use ten per cent of our brains . 
UNKNOWN Good point . 
UNKNOWN It works . 
UNKNOWN It's a necessary evil . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Ready for the next slide? 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN And so people say that they typically lose it , as you yourself know , because you probably lose your remote control all the time , much like any small appliance like a cellphone , and they we need something simple , because most people , well thirty four percent say that it's just too much time to learn how to use a new one , and we don't want to go we don't want to vary too far from the normal standard remote , but I mean they do need to be able to identify it , and R_S_I_ , I'm not very sure what that is . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Lost . 
UNKNOWN S Wait , is that like your ergonomics like your hand movements or something ? 
UNKNOWN It's okay . 
UNKNOWN It's very important . 
UNKNOWN Yes , it is important for the remote control world . 
UNKNOWN Sh Uh possibly . 
UNKNOWN Could be , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Do we really need t to provide more information on what R_S_I_ is ? 
UNKNOWN Like Channel , volume , power . 
UNKNOWN Uh yeah , that's what my web site said , I don't know . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN I think that's a pretty good guess though . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I would assume so . 
UNKNOWN I think we're supposed to know it as remote control experts . 
UNKNOWN It's like if you're holding it to just say , where are you , and thing beeps , you know . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But also s so the channel , the volume and the power buttons are the most important on our company website you can find like the specific statistics concerning to how much each button is used , but those are the definitely the top ones . 
UNKNOWN It's okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Next slide? 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN And so personally I think that we need a modern eye-catching design , but it it really needs to be simple . 
UNKNOWN So saying from y your slide, your presentation, the engineering versus the user-specified remotes , I think that we should go with something that's more user-friendly . 
UNKNOWN User-friendly . 
UNKNOWN Where the engineering ones , the boxes , tend to make it look more complicated than it really is . 
UNKNOWN Um the functionality of the product really needs to be considered as to like what type of buttons do we really need on it . 
UNKNOWN And it needs to be open to a wide range of consumers , so even though we need a small number of buttons , we also need to take in like are most people going to be using it for a D_V_D_ player , a TiVo , what what exactly are we using it for , as well as the age range . 
UNKNOWN So we need a hip , but not a corny marketing scheme for promoting our product . 
UNKNOWN And also we found our team found that speech recognition is it's like an up-and-coming thing they really consumers are really interested in it , and since our findings found that people are willing to pay more money for a remote for it to be more high-class we could consider it . 
UNKNOWN And so just to just to clarify by speech recognition you mean they would say , channel five , and the thing would go to channel five ? 
UNKNOWN I guess so , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I guess we can interpret it like , we can just try out different types of speech recognition within our remote programme . 
UNKNOWN Oh , that'd be lovely . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Didn't they um didn't our rival companies manufacture a remote that you would press the button on the T_V_ and it would the remote would beep so if you have lost it Mm . 
UNKNOWN It's kinda like what the remote phone used to do . 
UNKNOWN Oh , yeah , that's true . 
UNKNOWN You know like go to the base . 
UNKNOWN We could definitely include that if we wanted to . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN If it's within our price . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Are we ready for our last presentation, Amber ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I'm just trying to move it . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN I think it should be there , working design . 
UNKNOWN Working design . 
UNKNOWN There we go . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN Uh I didn't get a chance to complete this one , 'cause some of the tools that I was given were frustrating . 
UNKNOWN Oh my bad . 
UNKNOWN Oh that's fine . 
UNKNOWN Uh okay , so method method of our design , I think I just start listing th some of the things that we actually need to put into this . 
UNKNOWN Help me . 
UNKNOWN We need a power source , we're gonna need a smart chip if we're gonna make it multi-functional . 
UNKNOWN Um extra functions will probably need an additional chip . 
UNKNOWN Either that or the smart chip will have to be extremely smart . 
UNKNOWN What exactly is a smart chip ? 
UNKNOWN Usually a smart chip is just a chip that's been programmed and designed so that it can complete a fair range of functions . 
UNKNOWN Well , how much extra would the additional chip be ? 
UNKNOWN Is that gonna push us over our production costs ? 
UNKNOWN I wouldn't think so , 'cause we could probably get it from like , in bulk , from a a newer company . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN And they tend to sell their chips pretty cheap . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Ready ? 
UNKNOWN Um yep , nothing here . 
UNKNOWN That's okay . 
UNKNOWN Um power source , I figured , batteries , 'cause they're easily available . 
UNKNOWN Typically a remote has either two double A_s or four triple A_s , sometimes three . 
UNKNOWN Uh it really kinda depends on the size of the actual remote itself . 
UNKNOWN Um a large on-off button , demographically we're moving towards an older generation of people , so a large on-off button would probably be good . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Selection button for various entertainment devices , so you want something that will permit you to select the D_V_D_ player or the T_V_ or the stereo system . 
UNKNOWN Um smart chip that perverts uh that permits , sorry , universal application again , something that'll allow us to skip over between devices , and that's kinda it . 
UNKNOWN Uh this is my fifty second design . 
UNKNOWN Power source over here . 
UNKNOWN We're gonna have a switch obviously between the power source and the rest of it , and you're gonna need the switch . 
UNKNOWN Um extra bulb could just be for flashiness , um subcomponent which would be like a way of diverting the power to different parts of the the device . 
UNKNOWN Um the chip and of course the infra-red bulb , so it can communicate with the various devices that it needs to talk to . 
UNKNOWN So what exactly we are looking at , is this like the front of the remote ? 
UNKNOWN This is just like a rough schematic . 
UNKNOWN So this is the internal workings . 
UNKNOWN So this would be the front ? 
UNKNOWN So the red would be the front of the remote though , right ? 
UNKNOWN Oh okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's gonna be what's communicating with the T_V_ , but the other bulb , I think , is good to just to indicate , I'm doing something , it's sort of like a reassurance . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN The l the light up kind of Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Like that we know the battery's working . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , so you don't have to stare at that infra-red , 'cause you know when the battery starts dying in your remote currently , you have to actually stare at that bulb and go , okay , when I push this button , is it working ? 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN It'd probably be lighting up the key too , right ? 
UNKNOWN We can skip that whole thing . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN So you can put it in the dark . 
UNKNOWN The buttons . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , and that's good . 
UNKNOWN We should make it glow in the dark . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , definitely . 
UNKNOWN 'Kay nex R Ready ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's it . 
UNKNOWN 'Kay , any p 'Kay ? 
UNKNOWN Mm 'kay . 
UNKNOWN Anything you wanna add for personal preferences though , you f you said already that we needed a large on-off button , you think . 
UNKNOWN I think that that's a good idea , because you know that's one of the most important buttons . 
UNKNOWN Anything else ? 
UNKNOWN Just Well , should it be larger buttons in general , you know like uh the examples that I had , they were swi quite small . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So should we try and go for something that has l larger buttons ? 
UNKNOWN I think we should . 
UNKNOWN Like I think that would be in a as in like in for the design , sorry , um . 
UNKNOWN I think we should definitely go with buttons that don't look like a normal remote , 'cause most remotes have small square buttons , I think we should do something like maybe bigger and round like bubbles . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Ovals . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Okay , let's talk about all of our We'll come to decision later about all the components that we need to include , let's um wrap up this one , and I'm gonna go back to my PowerPoint, 'cause we need to discuss the new project requirements which you might've already seen flashed up on the screen a bit earlier . 
UNKNOWN Wait , come back . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
UNKNOWN Sorry , let's go through this . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
UNKNOWN Here we go . 
UNKNOWN New product requirements . 
UNKNOWN First it's only going to be a T_V_ remote . 
UNKNOWN We're trying not to over-complicate things . 
UNKNOWN So no D_V_D_ , no TiVo , no stereo . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN It's not gonna be multi-functional . 
UNKNOWN Hey . 
UNKNOWN And we th need to promote our company more , so we need to somehow include our colour and our company slogan on the remote . 
UNKNOWN We're trying to get our name out there in the world . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN And you know what teletext is ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN in States we don't have it , but um it's like they just have this channel where just has news and weather , kind of sports , it's very um bland looking , it's just text on the screen , not even Yeah , just black with just text . 
UNKNOWN I know . 
UNKNOWN What is it ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , it's like black , black and white kind of It'll give you the sports . 
UNKNOWN Like running along the bottom ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN You can also get the kind of the T_V_ guide so It's the entire screen is just running information at random . 
UNKNOWN Wait , is it like the Weather Channel where it's got like the ticker running on the bottom or something ? 
UNKNOWN Kind of . 
UNKNOWN Except the entire screen . 
UNKNOWN Yeah it's the whole screen . 
UNKNOWN You can pick sports , you can pick the news , you entertainment , you know it's like Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So anyway Right . 
UNKNOWN Seemingly . 
UNKNOWN So it's like a separate channel from like what you're watching ? 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN But it's becoming out-dated now , because of the Internet . 
UNKNOWN Nobody needs to go to the teletext channel to check the news , and we have twenty four hour news channels now too , so Those are our new product requirements . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So , do we have to include the company colour within that ? 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN It's part of the logo . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Company colour being yellow . 
UNKNOWN What we're going to do right now is come to some decisions , definitive that we can all agree on , about um the target group and the functions and just definite things that we need to do and then we'll close up the meeting . 
UNKNOWN So . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
UNKNOWN Whatever . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So our target group is You mentioned um older people ? 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Would it just be universal for everyone , you think ? 
UNKNOWN Because I think even if something has large buttons , as long as they are not childishly large , like even technically non-technically challenged people are gonna use it . 
UNKNOWN It's gonna make it nicer . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I mean they want something user-friendly , so Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Mm well , even if we kept the regular standard size of remote , if we reduced the buttons down to the ones that people are saying that they use the most often and a couple extra , 'cause they're saying they only use ten per cent of them , then we should be able to accommodate fairly decent sized buttons . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so we want um for our target group would we say , I mean , young and old , all age ranges , all um , not kids obviously , right ? 
UNKNOWN Or kids ? 
UNKNOWN No , kids need to know how to use a remote , I would think . 
UNKNOWN Most of them will intuitively pick it up though . 
UNKNOWN They gotta change between Disney Channel , Cartoon Network . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so we're going to go anywhere from kids to adult in the age range Um what about technic technical um specifications , like how how technically literate are these people who are going to be using our remote ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I think we need it all . 
UNKNOWN Um I would say we should say dumber than the average person . 
UNKNOWN We should go for the lowest denominator . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Right , okay . 
UNKNOWN High school educated . 
UNKNOWN So so they need no technical experience to operate Okay . 
UNKNOWN how 'bout little to no , because there is no way that you are gonna be able to make it no . 
UNKNOWN And we also need to determine the specific functions of this , just to get it all out on paper. 
UNKNOWN So we said it needs to send messages to the T_V_ , needs to change the channel , turn on and off , just basic simple stuff like this . 
UNKNOWN So if you have something just say it and we'll add it to my meeting minutes. 
UNKNOWN Well it's channel , on-off button , volume , mute . 
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm , volume . 
UNKNOWN And channel . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Those are the most important ones . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN And we wanna keep um I'll make a note here that we wanna keep the number of buttons down . 
UNKNOWN Correct , because people only use ten percent . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN Hey , what else ? 
CONFUSION Um . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Do we want this thing to be able to be found easily ? 
UNKNOWN I think so . 
UNKNOWN What do you A finding kind of device or Yeah , ho homing device . 
UNKNOWN Sure , yeah . 
UNKNOWN And like if this is gonna get lost underneath the coach , how are we going to accommodate the quick ability to find it ? 
UNKNOWN I need we we need a like homing device . 
UNKNOWN Oh right yeah okay . 
UNKNOWN Mm 'kay . 
UNKNOWN Tracking . 
UNKNOWN Because people really are looking for a remote that's more high-tech . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN What if we gave it a charger ? 
UNKNOWN And on the charger , just like a phone , like you get a portable phone and it's got a charger , and if you d leave your phone somewhere , you push the button to find it , and it finds th the phone beeps for you . 
UNKNOWN But you got a base . 
UNKNOWN Do you think people'll really go for that though ? 
UNKNOWN Because Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It's useful for the remote phone . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Would that add to our costs at all , I wonder ? 
UNKNOWN I would think so , because you'd have to develop a base . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Well , if you have the base , you could start putting in a charger and then you have a different kind of battery . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Rechargeable batteries are cheaper usually . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN I I think we can make a decision about that later . 
UNKNOWN Uh we'll still put that as a point that we need to discuss . 
UNKNOWN So that would include battery source Power source rather . 
UNKNOWN Is it going to have a charger , or is it going to be run strictly off batteries ? 
UNKNOWN And we also need to deal with the issue you mentioned of speech recognition , if we want that . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Do w Well , th there's the people who desire speech recognition , there's the different demog demographics have different desires , I don't know if you guys ge It wouldn't copyonto the the thing 'cause it's black , but all the different age groups have different desires for speech recognition . 
UNKNOWN Well , then we could If we have the speech recognition then we can start aiming at a like another kind of more handicapped disabled uh demo demographic . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN You could um we could hook it up . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN So basically older people don't really care . 
UNKNOWN It's really the people twenty five to thirty five . 
UNKNOWN I feel those are the people that really watch a lot of T_V_ though . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN They're the ones that get addicted to soap operas and just sitcoms and stuff . 
UNKNOWN Well Well , then then do you put the voice recognition do you put the r like receiver on the actual television , in the base , or in the actual remote , 'cause then you've already got remote in your hand , why you just gonna speak to the remote , whereas if you just speak in general and you don't have to have the remote in your hand and like talk at it . 
UNKNOWN And if and if we introduced it when they're this age , they're going to probably always buy a remote that has Right . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN So Right . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN and the speech recognition could be part of the lost and found device , too . 
UNKNOWN If we said , find remote , locate remote , or something . 
UNKNOWN A certain phrase then it could beep . 
UNKNOWN I dunno . 
UNKNOWN Just throwing it out there . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well Okay , anything else we wanna discuss ? 
UNKNOWN Still fifteen minutes . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Well , do we wanna include the numbers like zero through nine ? 
UNKNOWN Can we conceive of leaving them out ? 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Wait , on the remote itself ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , like you have one , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight , nine , zero . 
UNKNOWN Well , we definitely need those . 
UNKNOWN How how , yeah , how would you leave those out ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well , I don't know , I mean , if you can like well I don't know , if there's just a way of leaving them out ? 
UNKNOWN Unless you could say the channel . 
UNKNOWN I think people would find that too foreign . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's true . 
UNKNOWN You definitely need Wait . 
UNKNOWN And also remember that in this day in age we need , you know , like a hundred button , too . 
UNKNOWN I used to have a remote that did not even go up past like fifty . 
UNKNOWN So I couldn't whenever I got cable , I had to get a new T_V_ . 
UNKNOWN It's when we get satellite . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN get your own remote , or digital cable . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN I guess , we're gonna discuss the project financing later , making sure that we can fit all of the stuff that we want to on our budget . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , 'cause I don't have any material pricing information available to me at the moment , so R_ the double R_ . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN And don't forget we need to include the colour of our company and the logo . 
UNKNOWN The colour being yellow ? 
UNKNOWN I'm guessing . 
UNKNOWN And how do we Can't make it entirely Well if you have like a Hang on . 
UNKNOWN I feel like a ye I feel like a yellow one would be too garish . 
UNKNOWN And the R_R_ . 
UNKNOWN We could just have the logo in yellow , or maybe a yellow light for the keys . 
UNKNOWN Or is the l Yeah , yellow could be and it could doesn't have to be huge . 
UNKNOWN Or put like stripes , oh yeah , yellow lights . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN If you have this sort of strip kind of down at the bottom the base of it , just like yellow with the R_R_ . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN So we've simplified , we don't need all those um play , fast-forward , rewind , or no menu buttons . 
UNKNOWN Right , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So we've pretty much pared it down to on-off , volume , mute , channel up and down , um the numbers Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um can we go back to I'm gonna look really quickly back at those examples and see if there is anything . 
UNKNOWN Two examples . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Which one is yours , technical functions or functional requirement ? 
UNKNOWN Oh , it's a Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , audi audio settings and screen settings , we need those like audio settings mono , stereo , pitch , screen settings like brightness , colour , or do we just want that accessed accessed from the television itself ? 
UNKNOWN The T_V_ . 
UNKNOWN I think that that's fine just for the T_V_ . 
UNKNOWN I mean how often does the average user need to do that kind of stuff ? 
UNKNOWN Well , the other option is sort of like down at the bottom , like farther away , you just have this sort of box inset where it's like the buttons that you don't use as much , but occasionally you will use . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , 'cause we need to we definitely need to have buttons for like sub-titles and things like that . 
UNKNOWN and so it's like I don't well , I don't know . 
UNKNOWN It's 'cause the foreign film market is expanding and stuff , and like on television like I know f k living in Los Angeles it's tons of Spanish network television if it has English sub-titles it's definitely helpful . 
UNKNOWN Couldn't we do that all through one button , something , a menu button , that pops up with a menu on the T_V_ that says , you know , audio , video , whatever , language , you know ? 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN So we need up , down , and side-to-side buttons . 
UNKNOWN Well , that could be No you could just double up with like the channel or the volume buttons . 
UNKNOWN For the menus . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN That's true . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , okay . 
UNKNOWN Channel is just up and down . 
CONFIRMATION Okay , yeah . 
UNKNOWN And then add a Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Something that looks mayb you know . 
UNKNOWN Such as , yeah , the one the one over there on the left the engineering centred one . 
UNKNOWN Y right , right right right . 
UNKNOWN That one ? 
UNKNOWN So we just have it like add a menu button then for the various things needed , including v voice recognition if we have any like settings for voice recognition now included in the menu . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN In the middle perhaps . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN Ooh , I just got an idea for a design . 
UNKNOWN good . 
UNKNOWN Anybody have anything else they'd like to bring up in this meeting ? 
UNKNOWN I had something , but I forgot . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN get out of here . 
UNKNOWN Let's go back to the meeting closure then and see what we need to do next . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
UNKNOWN After this meeting we're gonna be sent a questionnaire and summary again which we need to reply to that e-mail . 
UNKNOWN And then we're gonna have lunch break . 
UNKNOWN And after lunch thirty minutes of individual work time . 
UNKNOWN Um I'm gonna put the minutesI put the minutesfor the first meeting already in the project documentsfolder , if you'd like to review them . 
UNKNOWN And I'm gonna type up the minutesfor this one as well . 
UNKNOWN Um here's what we're each going to do . 
UNKNOWN The I_D_ is going to work on the components concept , um U_I_D_ the user interface concept , and you're going to do some trend watching . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN Specific instructions will be sent to you by your personal coach . 
UNKNOWN And if anybody has anything they would like to add ? 
UNKNOWN No ? 
UNKNOWN Okay , well , this meeting is officially over . 
THANKS Thank you all . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Hi Team . 
UNKNOWN Hope you had a good lunch . 
UNKNOWN Okay we're back for the conceptual design meeting . 
UNKNOWN Um let's get started . 
UNKNOWN 'Kay , here is the agendafor today's meeting . 
UNKNOWN Um we're gonna open it and I'm gonna keep the minutesas Project Manager . 
UNKNOWN We're gonna have three presentations, one from each of you again . 
UNKNOWN And then we are going to come to decision on the remote control concepts and then we're gonna close it up . 
UNKNOWN And we have forty minutes again . 
UNKNOWN 'Kay , and just to reiterate um after this meeting the team will reach a decision on the concepts of the remote control . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Let's go ahead and start off with your presentations. 
UNKNOWN Who would like to go first ? 
UNKNOWN Just trying to move mine right now . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um Courtney would you mind starting us off ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Trend watching ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so trend watching . 
UNKNOWN Uh since we do put the fashion in electronics , it is kind of important how our product looks . 
UNKNOWN So I guess we can go ahead and go to the next . 
UNKNOWN So what they want . 
UNKNOWN Right now customers want fancy versus functional . 
UNKNOWN Um basically about fifty eight percent of what they like of the product that they want , describing like the in order of how much they want , fifty eight per cent of the decision of what it should look like , fancy versus functional , and then it has to also be technologically innovative , and yet easy to use . 
UNKNOWN So the customer basically is confused . 
UNKNOWN They don't know exactly what they want . 
UNKNOWN They want us to tell them . 
UNKNOWN They want everything , but simply . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN Exactly . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So we can go to next . 
UNKNOWN Mm 'kay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So in Milan and Paris recently the trends have been showing that clothing , shoes and furniture are basically just covered with fruits and vegetable patterns . 
UNKNOWN So I don't know if we want to go with that um and also the spongy feel is in in contrast to last year . 
UNKNOWN I don't know really , I mean I guess the spongy could relate to the buttons if we want to rather than like a hard clicky button that you find on like some mobiles and stuff , you'd want like a softer touch . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN I mean do you guys know what I mean . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Yeah th I I can I can address some of that issue , I think , with uh my presentation. 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN But as for the fruits and vegetable patterns , I don't know if we really want to go with that , because it is just a trend , and our product we want to stay around for much longer than just a few months , because Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN People don't buy a new remote every so often . 
UNKNOWN I mean that could just be a Spring thing right now . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Awesome . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um so design preferences , um we need easy to read like large buttons , clearly labelled so that , I mean 'cause we talked about that being a problem . 
UNKNOWN Um and then also buttons illuminating upon touch , you said that in your design , with the bulb . 
UNKNOWN Um and that could also tie in with the colour scheme . 
UNKNOWN Uh we need the Real Reaction logo and colour scheme obviously . 
UNKNOWN That's one of our key goals , we wanna promote our product . 
UNKNOWN And I was thinking about different types of designsand I came up with something . 
UNKNOWN Actually right here . 
UNKNOWN So what we could do is something like an old-fashioned telephone like this , where we put the buttons around , like we'd put a big on-off button or something else in the middle , I mean it could be the arrows or whatever for channel up and down , and then put the numbers around in like an old-fashioned dial shape . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause then it'll appeal to older generation and like said retro's cool . 
UNKNOWN So it's classically retro . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN So I mean that's just an idea if you guys like it . 
CONFIRMATION Very good . 
UNKNOWN I like it . 
UNKNOWN Okay , ready for the next slide? 
UNKNOWN And , yep . 
UNKNOWN And that's it . 
UNKNOWN Op mm 'kay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Great . 
UNKNOWN Great presentation. 
UNKNOWN Ready ? 
UNKNOWN Okay hang on . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN See if it's there . 
UNKNOWN Which one is it ? 
UNKNOWN I don't know . 
UNKNOWN Hang on . 
UNKNOWN Interface concepts , no ? 
UNKNOWN Interface concepts new . 
UNKNOWN Either refresh it , or it sh Oh wait , maybe I didn't put it there . 
UNKNOWN Y 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN Hang on . 
UNKNOWN Mine will always read copyof something or other . 
CONFUSION Sorry ? 
UNKNOWN I I copied mine before I sent it over . 
UNKNOWN Oh okay . 
UNKNOWN Sorry , hang on . 
UNKNOWN Don't know . 
UNKNOWN Oh there we go . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Okay , um looking at the interface concept , it's gonna be mostly examples of possibilities of where we can go with this . 
UNKNOWN Uh if you wanna start the next slide. 
CONFIRMATION Sure . 
UNKNOWN Um uh can't really see , but there's two possible ways , on the r left , if you see on th on the sides of of the remote , you have the sort of scroll down , so you have that option right there . 
UNKNOWN And then also there's the idea of the base . 
UNKNOWN That's sort of like an idea there . 
UNKNOWN And then on the right , we have what's really big trend right now , it's the iPod . 
UNKNOWN It's becoming really and so you have this sort of very very simplistic menu section uh with the round buttons , and it's sort of like you have the both kind of trendy and hip , but also very sleek and um and very simple , but technologically advanced . 
UNKNOWN So if you wanted to do that th if we could find a way of sort of like using that idea in a remote control then sort of look into it , but Anyway , next . 
UNKNOWN Mm 'kay . 
UNKNOWN Um there's the idea of like being able to do it by feel as well as by um by sight . 
UNKNOWN You'd you know you're in the dark , you don't wanna be looking at the remote control . 
UNKNOWN And the picture particularly is pointing out if you look at the top volume button it's a V_ , and so yo you're kind of feeling a V_ like volume up . 
UNKNOWN What it really is is a V_ and what it you think it is is down , because the down arrow . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN And so it's like a sort of a criticism you'd probably turn that o the other way up . 
UNKNOWN Um but then you have you could either do it by raised type , which could be you know , iffy , um sort of old-fashioned in a way . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Either that or just have it by shape , for example you have a specific triangular shape that you know you're looking at the up and down arrow . 
UNKNOWN And then the round ones you sort of feel by , you know , that's the second one down , that sort of thing . 
UNKNOWN So it's sort of looking into how we wanted t to do it by feel . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um this is sort of an example of going for a s certain demographic . 
UNKNOWN Um this is particularly geared towards children . 
UNKNOWN That's cute . 
UNKNOWN Um it's very cute , and we could probably change it to yellow , bright yellow for like a the for the company logo . 
UNKNOWN Um and you have the shapes and it's very simplistic and friendly looking . 
UNKNOWN Um and then the other thing that it would be able to do is just to pro be ab you program certain channels that only these children would watch , so it's like they ch watch , you know , the C_ Beebies or something like that , uh keep them away from other channels . 
UNKNOWN So that's like another ar Um , I mean , these are three examples sort of looking at it . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN You have the wider section for the main controls there . 
UNKNOWN Uh you could see how many buttons there are . 
UNKNOWN And then on the left you have an example of the round buttons , and a simpler design . 
UNKNOWN On the bottom we probably wouldn't need that , because it's more for like a D_V_D_ function which we are not gonna be using . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN So again it's sort of like just give you ideas and then down at the bottom you have the logos and that's where you could put the R_R_ , Real Reaction . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN And then finally these are like the sort of same examples , but also some more , just possibilities that we could go with . 
UNKNOWN None of them I'm particularly keen on by the way . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN But it's sort of like just taking aspects out of that and saying , well out of this one we like , you know the round section of um , b or we'd like the the button size on this . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Or I like , you know , the black finish or the silver finish or whatever . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN I have four of those remotes . 
UNKNOWN Good lord . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Ready ? 
UNKNOWN That's it . 
UNKNOWN Oh , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Great job . 
UNKNOWN Okay , my turn . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Whoo . 
UNKNOWN What's the title ? 
UNKNOWN It'll be copyof component design . 
UNKNOWN Got it . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Th that looks like it . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN So basic remote operation runs as follows , press button makes connection with the power source and the rest of the circuit , chip senses the connection , chip produces a morse code infra-red signal , specific to that button . 
UNKNOWN So you press the button , it produces uh a signal that's encoded specifically for that button . 
UNKNOWN Transistors amplify that signal and it goes to the T_V_'s centre , which interprets the signal response accordingly , changes channel etcetera . 
UNKNOWN So that being said Next slide, please . 
UNKNOWN Findings oh which were the required materials for the basic internal construction , so all the really simplistic functions that we just discussed , we need rubber for buttons , aluminium for battery y contacts , integrated circuit which consists of a diode , transistor , resonator , resistors , and a capacitator , all those basic things that make a circuit function . 
UNKNOWN Um fibreglass and thin copper wire to create the actual circuit board itself . 
UNKNOWN An L_E_D_ , which is a light emitting diode , um contact discs for the buttons , plastic for the casing , and a power-source , whatever power-source we've actually determined we want . 
UNKNOWN Next slide, please . 
THANKS Thank you . 
UNKNOWN Uh personal preferences , uh to save money for the components , the remote should be mass-produced and basic materials should be bought en masse . 
UNKNOWN Um if we find another company who can produce the required chips , casing , L_E_D_ , any additional materials we decide we require at a less expensive rate than we ourselves are producing , we should go for it . 
UNKNOWN Next slide, please . 
UNKNOWN Um just talking to the um manufacturing division . 
UNKNOWN They suggested power options , solar cells , hand dynamo , and kinetic power , so you shake it and it increases the power . 
UNKNOWN Um I'm not sure how the hand dynamo works , they have yet to get back to me on that . 
UNKNOWN So next slide, please . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Interesting . 
UNKNOWN Suggested casing options . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN We can offer options for casing such as straight , curved , double-curved , you know , very specific to the customer . 
UNKNOWN Options for materials , plastic , rubber , titanium , wood . 
UNKNOWN I don't think anyone's gonna go for a wood one , because splinters Yeah . 
UNKNOWN That would be amazing , though , yeah . 
UNKNOWN No , splinters would What is that ? 
UNKNOWN Um certain restrictions do apply here though . 
UNKNOWN Uh latex , you can't do solar power with a latex one . 
UNKNOWN So , if they want some a soft squishy rubber , they can't have the solar powered option . 
UNKNOWN Double-curved , you can't do titanium . 
UNKNOWN Um that would be two curvatures , so it would actually , if you the shape of your hand , you curve here and you curve here , so you could have two curves that match the shape of your hand to make it more comfortable to hold . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Now if you wanted that , you can't do titanium . 
UNKNOWN And uh so you functions what for the buttons , scrolling function could be very beneficial to us instead of actual buttons themselves . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN I think I have one more slide. 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN No , I didn't . 
UNKNOWN No , okay . 
UNKNOWN Um the manufacturing division also has said that um they have several types of chips and they've just developed a sample sensor or sample speaker chip , which we could utilise . 
UNKNOWN Um push button requires a simple chip and scroll requires more complicated chip . 
UNKNOWN So depends on what we decide we wanna do . 
UNKNOWN In addition to that if we're offering all those different options to the customer for producing their remote , we're going to have to have multiples of each type , like a double-curved in rubber , um you know , each option should have a certain select number produced with all those options . 
UNKNOWN So we'll have to mix it up , make sure we produce enough of everyone . 
UNKNOWN But that could also drive up the price of the actual remote itself if they know that we only produced five thousand , you know , double-curved wooden remotes . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN And that's all I got . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Alright , well thank you for those informative presentations. 
UNKNOWN Let's go back to um Now we have to make some decisions . 
UNKNOWN Where were we ? 
UNKNOWN Let me just add one more thing that I couldn't say before , and that's just that there's the new technology that they've developed on the voice recognition . 
CONFIRMATION Sure . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Oh this the thing we were talking about earlier . 
UNKNOWN Right except that it's sort of odd , and I'm no not exactly sure why they are explaining it in the way they are , um there's a sample sensor and there's a sample speaker unit for So , you would say like , good morning , coffeemaker , and it would respond , good morning , Jill , but I'm not sure exactly how it's gonna work , 'cause do you programme do we program the responses and the questions . 
UNKNOWN So does that mean that the user then has to ask the specific question , and can't change it in order for it to be recognised , or can it be altered in a certain way , or does the actually user program it , to say a channel means this . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Yeah , like using the menu to be like , enter your name into the screen like on the menu options . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN So that way the remote reads it . 
UNKNOWN Right , so it's got like a limited memory and programme it . 
UNKNOWN So it's sort of iffy , but that's kind of what you'd say . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN I feel like voice recognition would be , I don't know , w it would be too hard to really I mean we could do it , but Technology . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Programme . 
UNKNOWN If it's within our price to get that kind of chip that would , you know , technology Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Well , we are making the chip . 
UNKNOWN So , I mean But , I guess , we have to look at w what our production cost is for the chip itself anyway . 
UNKNOWN And it is a growing trend , the higher technological , like the , I mean just like the more advanced it is , the better it'll sell . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I I thought offering some of those options for different materials that it could be made of different , you know I think we'd have to decide on the power options , maybe . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN So that we could reduce cost . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , 'cause we need to know how big it's gonna be and how heavy . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay , that kind of brings us to this , let's let's see if we can decide what kind of energy source we want to have first and foremost . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Do we wanna go for batteries or a stand like the one that we saw illustrated earlier ? 
UNKNOWN Oh the base , yeah . 
UNKNOWN The base , the charging base with rechargeable batteries ? 
UNKNOWN I think the p That's true . 
UNKNOWN I always feel like first I wanna know what it looks like , before 'Cause if it's something really really small , then it's sort of harder to imagine a base for it , that was p quite a s substantial size sort of standing up Right . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , and we don't have multiple things that it has to control , it just has to control the T_V_ . 
UNKNOWN W We need to decide , well so we can figure how big it's gonna be , like exactly what buttons we want and exactly It could be like this . 
UNKNOWN It's not gonna be a huge universal remote . 
UNKNOWN What size battery and Right . 
UNKNOWN Well , the other thing is like even if it's got a few buttons , so we want it to be bigger than this , 'cause it still fits in your hand , so you still wanted something that's comfortable and substantial , but not necessarily full of buttons . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN I'd , well uh This one is really comfortable , like I like the sides whatever , because But if we have the um , the locator , then we don't have to worry about that . 
UNKNOWN Are you gonna lose it easier ? 
UNKNOWN So we can make it small if we have a l locating device . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN If we do a voice-activated locator , though , we're gonna be looking at a more substantial chip . 
UNKNOWN So Honestly , I think the customer would be kind of irritated by the fact that it has a base if we did do a nice small , compact Mm yeah . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN So i That's the other thing , it's like You know Are we gonna have certain chips that are gonna require bigger size period ? 
UNKNOWN Two double A_s , for this size . 
UNKNOWN But like , you know , if we get more complicated then it's gonna v be have to be bigger to just accommodate the chip size . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN I agree , it's either gonna be bigger with a base or smaller with just A battery like this guy . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So we sh Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Smaller , without Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Alright , so what direction do you want to go in ? 
UNKNOWN You wanna vote ? 
UNKNOWN I think if we had a a locating device with the small one , I think that seems way more advanced . 
UNKNOWN I'm kind of I'm kind of leaning in the direction of this kind of bigger and the base . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I'm a away from the base . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN 'Kay so The only problem with that is if you forget to take it out of your pocket and it goes in wash . 
UNKNOWN That just seems so clunky and Okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , because I mean if even looking at cellphones right now , those trends the smaller the hotter it is , yeah Oh . 
UNKNOWN Smaller and smaller , yeah , yeah , yeah . 
UNKNOWN You're kidding . 
UNKNOWN You know it happens . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I've had three watches go that way too . 
UNKNOWN Oh watches I've but I've never washed a cell phone . 
UNKNOWN Ouch . 
UNKNOWN A phone , whoa , that would wow , that would hurt . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so what kind of material do we want to be made out of ? 
UNKNOWN Pieces everywhere . 
UNKNOWN Well , we have lots of options . 
UNKNOWN I don't think wood is a viable option . 
UNKNOWN Yeah wood . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN Well , titanium s I was saying that titanium , if we're being restricted then I would probably lean away from that . 
UNKNOWN Oh what did you Oh sorry , go ahead . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , 'cause if it's gonna cost us more to produce a chip , titanium will be more expensive . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN However , well , we only wanna sell it for twenty five Euro right ? 
UNKNOWN What would you recommend ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause I was thinking if we wanted to get the high in market then you could produce a few in titanium , make them a rarity so to speak . 
UNKNOWN That'll Yeah , exactly . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN The selling point , yeah . 
UNKNOWN We could do that , because all our research shows that people are definitely willing to spend more if Good plan . 
UNKNOWN Are we restricted by this ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well the original Okay . 
UNKNOWN I I think we should just focus on one design and one concept right now.I'm not sure that we'll have the time and money to produce a whole array of remotes . 
UNKNOWN Twenty five Euros So you're talking about like when it leaves our salesroom then it's all gonna be cherry-coloured or is it gonna be the kinda thing where people come back and swap it ? 
UNKNOWN If this was a successful remote , we might then produce a higher end version of it , I think . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Good plan . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so we wanna go for plastic , or what would you recommend for materials ? 
UNKNOWN Honestly I'd recommend like um uh since we're going with batteries instead of solar power , I'd recommend maybe a uh soft like latex , because we could produce , you know how cellphones have those overlays that you can change the colour . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN We could do uh one that fits in with the trends of the year so , because this year is all fruit , God only knows why , um we could do f a cherry cover for this year and then i if next year is stripes or solids , you know They could come back . 
SURPRISE Oh .
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , who knows . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN O or we could like take off this . 
UNKNOWN They could buy cases , maybe , if they wanted . 
UNKNOWN And buy the extra case . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN I think it's good to sell a basic thing and then sell options . 
UNKNOWN So we could do like a b a hard base plastic , and then we could give two latex covers to start . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN The what the top face , right ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , because the soft latex definitely is squishy . 
UNKNOWN That's in . 
UNKNOWN Well I mean squishier than like , yeah , just a hard plastic . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Okay , and what kind of chip would we need for this guy ? 
UNKNOWN How complicated Are we gonna go with the voice activated Well , we could give it a specific code , you know , remote missing . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I don't think we should do voice , I think we should just do um the recognition for when it's lost , you know . 
UNKNOWN A tracker , yeah . 
UNKNOWN could we Yeah . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause that uh what it type of , yeah , for voice activation would it be like a certain term what we would say like , because people could just be talking and we don't want it going off all the time . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN So uh Ooh . 
UNKNOWN Uh see I'm uh I'm strangely attracted to it , because I know that's it's definitely gonna be big , because it's , I don't know , it's just so high-tech . 
UNKNOWN Well , my little sister got for Christmas she got one of those key finders that's like a key-ring , and you have to whistle in a certain frequency for it to work . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , see that would just irritate me . 
UNKNOWN And then she would laugh and it would start going off in her purse , and you couldn't turn it off . 
UNKNOWN Oh dear . 
UNKNOWN Oh , then maybe voice maybe voice activation won't be good . 
UNKNOWN So it became highly irritating . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So I think having a key-phrase is much better . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
UNKNOWN But it's not gonna be voice activated in the fact that you would say , channel up , and it would work , right ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , n n no , we just want it to be a finder . 
UNKNOWN But then it Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Just a Okay , alright . 
NEGATION No . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN But do can your can the department make Oh , brilliant then . 
UNKNOWN That would be like a mid-class um Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So we don't actually have to go for Well , if they've just developed the sample sensor , sample speaker , it's a brand new chip . 
UNKNOWN Why not introduce it in this way ? 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , good point . 
UNKNOWN Mm 'kay . 
UNKNOWN Uh and what size batteries , double A_ , triple A_ ? 
UNKNOWN I think triple A_ , it'll be lighter . 
UNKNOWN Two ? 
UNKNOWN Could it run off of two They're more expensive though , too . 
UNKNOWN I mean more more come in a package . 
UNKNOWN Well , that depends on what the energy is needed . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think , well , we could d r do two or we could do one small lithium , 'cause you know the lithium batteries are doing quite well in most other electronic products , right ? 
UNKNOWN So they're more widely available now . 
UNKNOWN And they also have a longer battery life than most batteries . 
UNKNOWN But if you only have to replace it every five years . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN That's a good point . 
UNKNOWN Thoughts anybody ? 
UNKNOWN As long as we sell it with it . 
UNKNOWN Well , how about a initial , you get one battery when you buy it , 'cause I'm pretty sure we can get them pretty cheap on bulk . 
UNKNOWN Right , that's what I meant . 
UNKNOWN We could think about it and come back to it next meeting . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN We still have one more meeting . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So we've covered that first category , User Interface Concept , meaning design . 
UNKNOWN What's it gonna Yeah , what's it gonna look like . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN I ki I kind of like your idea about the retro phone dial , and that the central button could have , maybe our logo on it ? 
UNKNOWN It might be the four way scroll , too . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , it could be whatever , as long as there's something big in the middle , because like the old phones , there's like that just like piece of metal or like a picture or something in the middle . 
UNKNOWN I mean if Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Well , my issue with that is if it got too big though , 'cause if you have the circle and the button in the middle , then is it gonna get wider than your your hands are , because w And then would the buttons be too small if it was enough to fit on it ? 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Oh , that's true . 
UNKNOWN Good point . 
UNKNOWN In the sample ones that you showed us there was one that had the scroll buttons on the side , which I think if we make it curved like a hand like a hand-shape like if we put the the scroll-button on the side , that could be particularly useful . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Oh , I see what you mean . 
UNKNOWN I think so . 
UNKNOWN So scroll buttons on the side and then buttons on top ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I like that . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN But we definitely If we have scroll things on the side , we definitely have to have 'em labelled . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , like on the side of it . 
UNKNOWN Well , if it's just up and down Volume or channel . 
UNKNOWN Oh if it's just up and down . 
UNKNOWN But is that for Which ? 
UNKNOWN I don't know . 
UNKNOWN Well , you could do some on both sides . 
UNKNOWN Do we have both sides ? 
UNKNOWN Can we ? 
UNKNOWN Mm yeah . 
UNKNOWN We should probably make it that you have to depress it to activate it then , 'cause oth otherwise you're not just holding it and going like this , you know . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So that you're just not holding it and it changes the chan Mm . 
UNKNOWN That's squishy . 
UNKNOWN That's squishy . 
UNKNOWN Well , the other option is in instead of a scroll you just have the buttons up on the side which are on the side . 
UNKNOWN have buttons . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN 'Kay any other ideas ? 
UNKNOWN Um what colour ? 
UNKNOWN Oh , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Latex covers . 
UNKNOWN We have to make sure that logo always sticks out when we put the latex covers on , so we'll have to like have a little square or something , so that the our logo's available . 
UNKNOWN W I think maybe we should do it on a b button itself though , because if people are able to change the covers , I don't know , maybe the on-off button , something , some the menu button , I don't know , but you know if we're gonna put our company logo on there and somebody could just get another one . 
UNKNOWN Well I sort of like having the a yellow strip at the bottom with the R_R_ like that . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And that's at the bottom of it . 
UNKNOWN Which button ? 
UNKNOWN Are they all gonna have our company logo on them ? 
UNKNOWN Every cover ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I don't think we should do that , because that would just be icky . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So I think maybe putting it on a button is probably a good idea . 
UNKNOWN If we want it to be visible and Um are all those those one that you showed where they were um s met silver-metallic looking ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But those are plastic , right ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN They're not titanium . 
UNKNOWN I kind of like that look . 
UNKNOWN Uh but , or if it was really Yeah , for the base or if we're going for the retro look , I think , like a really shiny black would be cool . 
UNKNOWN For our base one ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , or like a gun-metal grey , 'cause then it combines the silver and the black . 
UNKNOWN What are your thoughts ? 
UNKNOWN Gun-metal gray . 
UNKNOWN There you go , gun-metal gray . 
UNKNOWN I'm just really wary of the putting anything on a button . 
UNKNOWN Why ? 
UNKNOWN It'll wear off . 
UNKNOWN What's the button Well , w w then what's the button do , and how do you know that that is what the button does ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , buttons wear off . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN I guess . 
UNKNOWN Just looking at examples , y you just don't ever see the logo on a button , it's always on the actual casing . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN There's nothing saying that we have to put the logo on the front of the actual The only problem is we're using a latex overlay so it actually would go over top of everything and have holes for the buttons , so I was thinking maybe instead of doing that what we could do is leave a space for where the logo should be . 
UNKNOWN But we want it to be seen . 
UNKNOWN On the back ? 
UNKNOWN But you don't But uh , yeah , you don't see it . 
UNKNOWN It d visible Visibility though 'Cause if it was only on the back really the only time you're gonna see it is when you drop it or when you're changing the battery . 
UNKNOWN We need it to be seen . 
UNKNOWN Well , hang on . 
UNKNOWN The other option is , I don't know if you can see it but it's like if Yeah , it's like the second to last slide. 
UNKNOWN I can find it again . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN And yours was called Interface Concept ? 
UNKNOWN Interface , yeah . 
UNKNOWN This one ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well , for some reason I can't get it to just go to that slidedirectly . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Okay , it's the very right one . 
UNKNOWN You see at the bottom , it's kind of difficult to see , but you have like a d sort of s division between the bottom like , where the logo is , and if we have the replaceable section , it's like the top . 
UNKNOWN It doesn't necessarily replace the entire top . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN And so you have that one piece that stays and the rest just sort of clips in . 
UNKNOWN Okay , yes yes . 
UNKNOWN If c you envisioning it ? 
UNKNOWN And so that stays the same when you have the logo , and then you have this s slip that kinda clips in and that's the bit that changes . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Like a little cut-out kind of Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN That's like , you know , a a cellphone it's like the the screen is always just left opened . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN And so , what we are gonna do it like bright yellow with the R_R_ ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Some of tho Well , some of those buttons though are blue-based . 
UNKNOWN Anybody see anything that they liked in these ones ? 
UNKNOWN Um well , a lot of those buttons are blue-based . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Well , kind of . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Um and then if v we do have them illuminate upon contact , they could illuminate yellow . 
UNKNOWN Yellow . 
UNKNOWN Yellow , I like that idea . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Like if we like the one all the way on the left , uh you ca you can see it on your computer better . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Um where the button is actually blue , but the number itself is clear or white or whatever so if you pressed it would illuminate yellow . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN So we'd have blue and yellow for the touch buttons . 
UNKNOWN Oh , that one . 
UNKNOWN I like the yellow illumination idea , very good . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Any other ideas or thoughts ? 
UNKNOWN We all seem to be fairly in agreement about what we wanna do with this project so 'Kay . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Ha hang on Let me catch up . 
UNKNOWN Mm yeah . 
UNKNOWN Did we finalise what buttons we're including or we just everything that we said before ? 
UNKNOWN I think there will be time for that later . 
UNKNOWN I'm guessing . 
UNKNOWN 'Kay , well we're gonna wrap this up . 
UNKNOWN Um next meeting is gonna start in thirty minutes , and here's what we're each of us going to do . 
UNKNOWN The I_D_ is going to do the look and feel design , the U_I_D_ the user interface design . 
UNKNOWN I think you're going to get a lot of , I mean , the final say on what buttons get put We'll all talk about it , but I think , that's pretty much what you're gonna do , right ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I guess . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN And you're gonna do some product evaluation . 
UNKNOWN Okay , and right now , the I_D_ and U_I_D_ , you two are going to work together on a prototype using modelling clay . 
CONFIRMATION Great . 
UNKNOWN Fun . 
UNKNOWN Play Doh . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay , and you should all be getting an emailpretty soon . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
UNKNOWN Well , thank you for a very productive meeting . 
UNKNOWN Wonderful Ooh . 
UNKNOWN I wanna find our if our remote works . 
UNKNOWN Me too . 
SURPRISE Oh .
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Whoohoo . 
UNKNOWN Um here's the agendafor our last meeting . 
UNKNOWN Um after the opening we're going to have a prototype presentation, then we're going to discuss the evaluation criteria and the financing of our remote . 
UNKNOWN Then we're going to evaluate the product and I think the whole production process , and then we're gonna close it up , and we have forty minutes , so let's get started . 
UNKNOWN Oh , no , let's have the prototype presentation. 
UNKNOWN Mm 'kay , you ready ? 
UNKNOWN You or me ? 
UNKNOWN Y you read that stuff , since you wrote it . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Well , since our materials aren't exactly what we were going for , I'm just gonna translate what this all means for you . 
UNKNOWN I'll be the Vanna . 
UNKNOWN The base is gonna be gunmetal gray , which is what we had decided , and it's gonna be plastic . 
UNKNOWN Um then there's the latex cover , which is what you see as red . 
UNKNOWN Um because it can be replaceable , we just kinda went with the colour . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Um and then the buttons are actually kind of poking through rather than on top . 
UNKNOWN Um and the buttons will be a l much lighter blue , almost see-through . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN It's just sort of a very pale blue and a light-up yellow . 
UNKNOWN That's nice . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN The whole thing lights up if you press any button , rather than it just that one button will light up . 
UNKNOWN Good . 
UNKNOWN Um and then at the bottom we have our logo . 
UNKNOWN Um bright yellow sort of design with the R_R_ which will actually look like our logo . 
CONFIRMATION Great . 
UNKNOWN And then on the side you have the buttons . 
UNKNOWN They're one button , but they kind of push up and down . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN I don't think they're scrolling . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN They're just buttons . 
UNKNOWN Right , yeah . 
UNKNOWN And then yeah , the buttons . 
UNKNOWN On off switch will be here and as you've noticed on our prototype um they've ended up with a curvature kind of , by concave sort of thing , except for , you know , can't see underneath . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So I'm hoping that when we get to production we can actually make them like that , because they're very nice to stock you know , stick your finger in . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um the two squared buttons are are two probably least used , menu , mute , and then these are the numbers , so our channel and our volume will be on either side . 
UNKNOWN Thumb-shaped . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And then the last thing is just that it'll be black labelling on top , just which we didn't do . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN And did you determine um the curvature of the bottom part of it for the hand , is it gonna be a single or a double ? 
UNKNOWN I'd say a single . 
UNKNOWN Single . 
UNKNOWN Single . 
UNKNOWN Single sounds good , 'cause it's not big enough to really constitute a double . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Yeah , it's only actually the size of my hand . 
CONFIRMATION Great . 
CONFIRMATION Great . 
UNKNOWN I think you did an awesome job . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I think it's a beautiful Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It is beautiful , and it's everything that we discussed . 
UNKNOWN Good job , you guys . 
UNKNOWN Good job . 
UNKNOWN Oh thank you . 
UNKNOWN Whoohoo . 
UNKNOWN Those are really good . 
UNKNOWN Alright what's next in our agenda? 
UNKNOWN Um we're gonna discuss the evaluation criteria , and that's with Courtney . 
UNKNOWN Okay , it's a PowerPointpresentation. 
UNKNOWN I don't really know exactly what we should uh talk about . 
UNKNOWN It's under evaluation . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
UNKNOWN Um so these are the criteria we're gonna ask , is it easy to use , is it fashionable uh yeah , I guess we should write these down so we can reference them . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Feel good meaning what ? 
UNKNOWN Like does it feel good , like yeah , physically . 
UNKNOWN Physically , okay . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Sqi Right . 
UNKNOWN That's just for current trend . 
UNKNOWN It doesn't really count , you guys . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , it was a little difficult to incorporate the cover with the cherry fruit on it . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But it's so we do have removable covers , right ? 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Yeah , well then that's covered . 
UNKNOWN And so we n k everybody have that ? 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN I'll wait . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , she's got it . 
UNKNOWN It's good . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay so , we're using the criteria uh for a seven point scale , and so we need to discuss how we feel . 
UNKNOWN It falls within this range , so for easy to use , do we feel it's very easy to use ? 
UNKNOWN Are we going to indi I say we individually rate what do you say ? 
UNKNOWN True or false , easy to use . 
UNKNOWN You guys Okay . 
UNKNOWN Just orally . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Why not ? 
UNKNOWN We have okay . 
UNKNOWN Um easy to use . 
UNKNOWN I vote six . 
UNKNOWN Oh wait , that's false . 
UNKNOWN Oh , two . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN I'd say two as well . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , two . 
UNKNOWN Two . 
UNKNOWN Uh hello , we're great . 
UNKNOWN That's what I say . 
UNKNOWN Okay , fashionable ? 
UNKNOWN Um one . 
UNKNOWN At the moment , no . 
NEGATION No . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN I mean like no , I think it's very fashionable . 
UNKNOWN Me too , very chic . 
UNKNOWN I thi I would give it a one . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN One , I give it a one . 
UNKNOWN I'll give it a two , because at the moment it's not looking that way . 
UNKNOWN Well , that's that's just like that's a clay , it's a prototype . 
UNKNOWN Oh , and ma it's a prototype , right . 
UNKNOWN What do you think ? 
UNKNOWN Mm I don't think it's that fashionable . 
UNKNOWN I'd give it like three or four . 
UNKNOWN Well , now I'm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So , the average is about a two . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , it's a two . 
UNKNOWN But then I'm not fashionable , so don't use my opinion . 
UNKNOWN Two or three . 
UNKNOWN Two point five . 
UNKNOWN That's okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Neither are all o all the customers we have , either . 
UNKNOWN Um does it feel good ? 
UNKNOWN Imagine , since we obviously don't have that . 
UNKNOWN I feel like I think it feels good . 
UNKNOWN Does it feel good ? 
UNKNOWN Uh the shape of it actually does uh . 
UNKNOWN And it's i it is very ergonomically designed . 
UNKNOWN It's gonna be curved . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , it's gonna be thicker . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Depth . 
UNKNOWN I think so too . 
UNKNOWN I'll give it a two . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN Two . 
UNKNOWN I'll give it a one . 
UNKNOWN What do you say ? 
UNKNOWN I'd say a two . 
UNKNOWN Alright , average is two . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Is it technologically innovative ? 
UNKNOWN Oh sorry I'm taking over your job here . 
UNKNOWN Oh no , it's fine , you're I mean you're Project Manager . 
UNKNOWN Go right ahead . 
UNKNOWN Um yeah , I mean and it does it have voice I mean the phrase recognition on it ? 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN Right ? 
UNKNOWN We were able to do it with that kind of chip . 
UNKNOWN Oh right , the Right . 
UNKNOWN We could do it with the chip , yes . 
UNKNOWN It wasn't we have no reflection of it on the prototype , but that's because it's only two dimensions , really . 
UNKNOWN And there's no way you can represent it on here . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , right . 
UNKNOWN Y Yeah , so . 
UNKNOWN That was 'kay . 
UNKNOWN And we discussed that being included . 
UNKNOWN Then yes , then I would well it isn't what else would it need for it to be technologically innovative ? 
UNKNOWN It Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well we don' have the you know , we can't say channel , and it changes the channel , channel eight . 
UNKNOWN And it doesn't cover anything other then T_V_ , so I'd probably give it a three . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Even though it is for just a T_V_ remote it's uh very advanced . 
UNKNOWN But it is just a T_V_ remote . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I'd go for a three or four on that one , so okay , let's go for a three point five . 
UNKNOWN Yeah I go four . 
UNKNOWN Three and an half . 
UNKNOWN Alright , and the last criteria is it is it um Well , we've covered that with the trendy . 
UNKNOWN Squishy and fruity . 
UNKNOWN Well yeah , so I'd give it a two . 
UNKNOWN It's just trendy , basically . 
UNKNOWN It's capable of being squishy and fruity . 
CONFIRMATION Sure . 
UNKNOWN Capable . 
UNKNOWN Oh , it's very capable of being squishy and fruity . 
UNKNOWN Very capable . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN And it's very important . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN 'Kay , there we go . 
UNKNOWN Okay , next . 
UNKNOWN So . 
UNKNOWN Next . 
UNKNOWN So um our re model slightly resembling a giant delicious cookie appears to be a winner , and uh hopefully we'll sell millions . 
UNKNOWN Good job , team . 
UNKNOWN How did you get that in there ? 
UNKNOWN What ? 
UNKNOWN The slightly resembling a giant delicious cookie . 
UNKNOWN It it does . 
UNKNOWN It does . 
UNKNOWN That was good . 
CONFIRMATION Thanks . 
CONFIRMATION Very good . 
UNKNOWN Alright , let's go back to this No , that's it . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Oops . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so now uh we're moving on to finance , okay . 
UNKNOWN I'm gonna show you an Excel spreadsheetand we're going to fill it in together based on what components we're including in our remote and see if it's under twelve fifty Euro . 
UNKNOWN If so , we can proceed , if not , we need to go back to the drawingboard a little bit . 
UNKNOWN 'Kay ? 
UNKNOWN So let me bring that up . 
UNKNOWN Here we go . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
UNKNOWN Um it's not hand dynamo , it's powered by battery , so we give it a Number of components you plan to use . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN Two . 
UNKNOWN Do I just put quantity being one battery , or Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Mm 'kay . 
UNKNOWN But if it's a do you wanna go for this is where we need to make a final call on if it's a lithium or do we wanna go triple A_s , 'cause triple A_s we're gonna have t do more than one battery . 
UNKNOWN Oh , let's just go for a lithium . 
UNKNOWN What do you say ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , let's let's do a lithium . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , it's . 
UNKNOWN I think uh I think the people who purchase this are gonna be technologically right . 
UNKNOWN We're gon that's gon Nologically advanced , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay , down to the electronics um section . 
UNKNOWN We're gonna need this kind , correct , if we do the voice sensor , so one of those . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN It is a single-curved , so one of those . 
CONFUSION Uh . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN What's that ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's correct . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN 'Kay , down here , case material . 
UNKNOWN It's plastic . 
UNKNOWN We plastic . 
UNKNOWN Plastic . 
UNKNOWN And special colour . 
UNKNOWN And special colour . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN Down here , interface type . 
UNKNOWN We're gonna have the integrated scroll scroll wheel . 
UNKNOWN No , we don't have the scroll . 
UNKNOWN Isn't oh those are just regular buttons . 
UNKNOWN But it's Yeah , but i so i But will we w actually we'll need two , won't we ? 
UNKNOWN Well , that's the push-button too , right there . 
UNKNOWN Buttons . 
UNKNOWN This ? 
UNKNOWN Integrated scroll-wheel or push-button . 
UNKNOWN We're really having just push-button interface . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so we can just go um . 
UNKNOWN One for the top and then one for the s one e for each side . 
UNKNOWN But it that just covers the type of button we're having . 
UNKNOWN Because we're not doing a scroll on the side , it's still push-button . 
UNKNOWN Oh like the twenty nine means like you have both scrolls and push-buttons . 
UNKNOWN Push-button . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Right I think she's I think what Courtney's talking about is do we need to put two here ? 
UNKNOWN But we just have push Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But we don't have any scrolls . 
UNKNOWN Like because there's like one interface right here and then because it's not gonna be on the same plane when you press the button . 
UNKNOWN There's gonna have to be additional signals on the sides . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN So is that gonna be an extra one on each side ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN I don't know , they might put us well , let's just . 
UNKNOWN Two interfaces , is that what w should we s say ? 
UNKNOWN Let's call it th Okay . 
UNKNOWN Two or would it be three ? 
UNKNOWN Or three , because of one on each side and one on top . 
UNKNOWN Okay , fine . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I mean it's fine 'cause it comes out the same as twenty nine . 
UNKNOWN Well less than twenty nine even . 
UNKNOWN Okay and we're gonna button supplements the buttons are no uh okay . 
UNKNOWN They're a special colour . 
UNKNOWN Um they're uh they're a special form , 'cause they're indented . 
UNKNOWN Are they ? 
UNKNOWN Oh , right . 
UNKNOWN And then s yeah . 
UNKNOWN And , they're a special material . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Well , we're under cost then . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
UNKNOWN We're over ? 
UNKNOWN No , we're under . 
UNKNOWN Grand . 
UNKNOWN We're under . 
UNKNOWN Twelve point five is our limit . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Oh , I see . 
UNKNOWN We've got eleven point two . 
UNKNOWN So we can go to production . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
UNKNOWN We can go to I dunno what I just did . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Now we're gonna talk about the project process um and whether or not we're satisfied with the whole process and the result . 
UNKNOWN Um did we have a lot of room for creativity ? 
UNKNOWN Did we have a lot of room for individual leadership , um teamwork , and the means , meaning the technology that we used to produce our little guy there , and if we found any new ideas . 
UNKNOWN Now , question is , how do we do this ? 
UNKNOWN Go back . 
UNKNOWN I think we just discuss it . 
UNKNOWN Discuss , sure . 
UNKNOWN Previous . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
UNKNOWN Who want who would like to go first ? 
UNKNOWN We think we got stifled for cri creativity by the company itself , in restricting us only to using a T_V_ remote , initially . 
UNKNOWN We didn't have a whiteboard . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Oh that's true . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN And no internet . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN No , yeah , that's a good point . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause I'd forgotten that that wasn't our decision , yeah . 
UNKNOWN And how did you feel about the whole the whole process though ? 
UNKNOWN Oh , overall I mean I thought we did a good job like We got to choose basically we had control over minus it being just merely a T_V_ remote we got to choose what we wanted to do with it . 
UNKNOWN Right , and we got say over what how technologically advanced it should be and also how fashionable , which I kind of like we yep . 
UNKNOWN And we're a fashion forward technology company . 
UNKNOWN You know it . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Um what about um the teamwork aspect ? 
UNKNOWN How did you guys enjoy making the model , the prototype ? 
UNKNOWN I think we did well . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think ya' did . 
UNKNOWN Did you work well together in there , and 'kay . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN Well , no , there was there was scratching and fighting , but no . 
UNKNOWN Minus that one fight . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Oh my God , and we've all been a pretty congenial team here , I think . 
UNKNOWN Gouges . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN We hadn't had any ma fallings out . 
UNKNOWN I mean minus you guys being wha what is it , the survey , annoying or what is it ? 
UNKNOWN Irritating . 
UNKNOWN Irritating . 
UNKNOWN Irritating , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Irritating . 
UNKNOWN Wow that's a it's definitely a strong one . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN The means , the whiteboard didn't work . 
UNKNOWN And no internet . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I have to knock that one down a couple notches . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , and no internet . 
UNKNOWN A and our friend here really feels strongly about the internet . 
UNKNOWN Misses . 
UNKNOWN I do . 
UNKNOWN And the digital the digital pens were they were pretty cool . 
UNKNOWN There's so much available . 
UNKNOWN Like it's information Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , digital pens . 
UNKNOWN I really appreciated those , yeah . 
UNKNOWN They were fine . 
UNKNOWN Yeah they were fun , even though I'm not really sure what I could do with them , but they are awesome . 
UNKNOWN The use of the laptops for receiving everything . 
UNKNOWN It was wireless too , so . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Right , laptops are extremely handy , wireless . 
UNKNOWN And these things whoa . 
UNKNOWN And that we have a shared network where we can put all of the Big brother . 
UNKNOWN And let's not forget the sexy dual microphones everyone gets to wear . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And Big Brother . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN 'Kay , have we found any new ideas through this process ? 
UNKNOWN Um we are really gonna sell this . 
UNKNOWN Ta-da . 
UNKNOWN For something that looks cool and also has what I want it to b do technologically . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And that's your right brain taking over , w wanting the artistic , the fashionable , the hip , you know . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN If we all just went out and bought useful things , I don't think I mean that's not what technology . 
UNKNOWN Well , that's why I don't like uh Macs or Apples , just 'cause I look at it , and I know it's probably a very good computer , but I look at it , and I'm taken back to elementary school , 'cause they look the same . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN They look like they did when I was in elementary school , and that's so old-fashioned to me . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , 'cause they're pretty and just like Uh yeah . 
UNKNOWN The Toronto district school would only use his Macs with their kids . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Exactly , so I associate them with like really low-tech , really cheap , bad Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Just the Mac font bothers me even . 
UNKNOWN But I do like iPods , go figure . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , no , iPods They want all those words for presentation, even the plugs . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well , i iPods are now quite trendy , and they come in different colours . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Colours . 
UNKNOWN Exactly . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I mean how many people went out and bough a Nokia phone , back when we were like in high school , just so they could get the changeable face plates . 
UNKNOWN Oh yeah , everybody . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Anyway , so that is definitely at work . 
UNKNOWN Not me . 
UNKNOWN Mine is amber . 
UNKNOWN But the my but my one issue is just like the whole it's for T_V_ only . 
UNKNOWN I didn't have a phone 'til university . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN I was like who's gonna buy a remote just for the T_V_ unless they've lost theirs . 
UNKNOWN Look at it . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN That is a piece of work . 
UNKNOWN Fashionable chic people will . 
UNKNOWN You're kidding . 
UNKNOWN Wow . 
UNKNOWN No , no . 
UNKNOWN Marketing Director says yeah . 
UNKNOWN Fashionable people will buy it . 
UNKNOWN No , marketing has to actually create the desire for it . 
UNKNOWN Oh , I will create desire . 
UNKNOWN That's okay . 
UNKNOWN We can create a commercial where they think that all their needs will be met . 
UNKNOWN This will help them find the one . 
UNKNOWN Ri They'll be sexy with it . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN We could have like an Adam and Eve type commercial , and that's the fig-leaf . 
UNKNOWN That's right . 
UNKNOWN Oh right . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN That'll sell . 
UNKNOWN There you go , marketing . 
UNKNOWN Let you loose . 
UNKNOWN And so the serpent says , use our remote . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , no . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay , we're gonna wrap this up now . 
UNKNOWN Um the costs are within the budget , we evaluated the project , and now we're gonna complete the final questionnaire and meeting summary , and then we're going to have a big giant party , apparently , according to this , so . 
UNKNOWN Whoohoo . 
UNKNOWN Alright , thank you team , you did a great job , it was lovely working with you . 
UNKNOWN Margaritas for everyone . 
UNKNOWN Good . 
UNKNOWN You too . 
UNKNOWN Yay . 
UNKNOWN Thanks to the Project Leader . 
UNKNOWN Now we know w Um sure . 
UNKNOWN Here we go . 
UNKNOWN Welcome everybody . 
UNKNOWN Um , I'm Abigail Claflin . 
UNKNOWN You can call me Abbie . 
UNKNOWN 'S see . 
UNKNOWN PowerPoint, that's not it .

UNKNOWN I think we'll get around to that , yeah . 
UNKNOWN We'll get round to that later . 
UNKNOWN So this is just introductions yeah . 
UNKNOWN My name is Chiara and I'm the Marketing Expert . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN I forgot to s say I'm the Project Manager but I figured you all knew that already , um so . 
UNKNOWN I'm Stephanie and I am the User Interface Designer . 
UNKNOWN I'm Krista and I'm the Industrial Designer . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um so f here's our agendafor today . 
UNKNOWN Um we're gonna do some tool training , project plan and discuss then close . 
UNKNOWN Um so . 
UNKNOWN So our aim is to produce a remote control that is original , trendy and user friendly . 
UNKNOWN And to do this , we have to um there's certain things we have to consider about functional aspects and conceptual design of the thing . 
UNKNOWN So . 
UNKNOWN We'll get to that . 
UNKNOWN Oh there it is . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Functional design , conceptual design and detailed design . 
UNKNOWN So throughout our next couple of meetings we'll we'll be covering these things . 
UNKNOWN Um so we're gonna try out our white board . 
UNKNOWN If we'll all drawour favourite animal , to sum up the characteristics of that animal . 
UNKNOWN So you want us to drawit and then talk about it ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Or just drawit ? 
UNKNOWN I think both . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Why don't we do both . 
UNKNOWN Both . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Who starts ? 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN We ought to decide who starts and all that . 
UNKNOWN No ? 
UNKNOWN Any volunteers ? 
UNKNOWN Uh-huh . 
UNKNOWN Does anyone know what they wanna draw? 
UNKNOWN Mm , I gotta think about it for a second like . 
UNKNOWN Uh Does it have to be functional , trendy and user friendly ? 
UNKNOWN I don't think so . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Okay , I'll draw. 
UNKNOWN I'll drawone . 
UNKNOWN Make sure my things here . 
SURPRISE Uh-oh . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Okay , my favourite animal is see . 
UNKNOWN Oops . 
UNKNOWN A dolphin . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , it's Yeah , I guess it has a fin on top too , yeah . 
UNKNOWN 'S like playing Pictionary . 
UNKNOWN It's my dolphin . 
UNKNOWN So what characteristics do you like about your animal ? 
UNKNOWN I like its tail . 
UNKNOWN Um , no , I think dolphins are really uh I dunno , they're smart and they they're cute and they like swimming and that's cool , like they're graceful yeah , and they're so Yeah they're sleek and they look intelligent and I don't know , they're I guess it's the whole like binocular vision thing . 
UNKNOWN They're graceful . 
UNKNOWN Sleek . 
UNKNOWN I don't know how intelligent that one looks . 
UNKNOWN Yeah he he doesn't look that smart . 
UNKNOWN He's a I dunno um they're I think it's cool the the um the interaction that or the th things that the reasons people seem to like you know you get ex you know people are sitting on the beach and p they're like oh look there's dolphins and it's kinda like but they're you know they jump around in the water and they're happy and they're mammals , but they swim . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN Does anybody else wanna drawtheir animal ? 
UNKNOWN Suppose I can drawan animal , yeah . 
UNKNOWN . 
UNKNOWN Uh-oh there goes the ten . 
UNKNOWN It's a cat . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I don't know . 
UNKNOWN They sleep all day , they're easy to draw. 
UNKNOWN Do you wanna anything ? 
UNKNOWN Uh yeah . 
UNKNOWN I dunno if the the ah . 
UNKNOWN Well I had the cat as well , but uh I've got a spare one . 
UNKNOWN I think the pen is running out of Two million . 
UNKNOWN So I'll use the spare one . 
UNKNOWN Um but it's harder to drawum . 
UNKNOWN And the pen's dying . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN A horse . 
CONFUSION Uh . 
UNKNOWN Horse . 
UNKNOWN Um I don't really know how the legs go , but anyway I will do that . 
UNKNOWN That's very good . 
UNKNOWN Um , and the main reason is they're pretty . 
UNKNOWN I think they're very pretty and they go well with the environment , and I like the way they run and I used to do horse riding and they're just very sort of sturdy and nice animals . 
UNKNOWN And I like the way um they feel , sort of under under the hand , I think that's pretty much it . 
UNKNOWN Um How many should we sell then ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN This cord's Uh . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Actually I haven't thought of anything yet . 
UNKNOWN Uh It's a pig . 
UNKNOWN So I'm thinking we should design a remote control that's water resistant , strong and furry . 
UNKNOWN What do you think , yeah ? 
UNKNOWN And furry . 
UNKNOWN This is yeah , well like a cat , you know , soft yeah . 
UNKNOWN Textile tactile , tactile remote control . 
UNKNOWN Although uh I'll just put there . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN You're dragging a you have a tail . 
UNKNOWN Oh my gosh , this is disastrous . 
UNKNOWN Sorry about that . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So moving on . 
UNKNOWN Our selling price goal is twenty five Euro and profit aim is fifty million Euro . 
UNKNOWN So I'm guessing that we're not actually in Scotland , we're in some European country . 
UNKNOWN Um , and we will hope to sell this internationally . 
UNKNOWN Sorry can you just say that what's the what are our price goals again ? 
UNKNOWN Um selling price is twenty five Euro . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Profit aim fifty million Euro . 
UNKNOWN Um , a lot , two two two million , two mi no , more f four million . 
UNKNOWN Anyone a mathematician ? 
UNKNOWN Four million . 
UNKNOWN And it well it's the profit so if a profit for each is twelve fifty , that'll do four million . 
UNKNOWN Oh , yeah . 
UNKNOWN It is a lot . 
CONFUSION Uh . 
UNKNOWN So f that's a fifty percent um uh . 
UNKNOWN Um , I don't know what these mean because I didn't actually make the slide-show . 
UNKNOWN Experience with remote control . 
UNKNOWN So I guess we have to reflect on our experiences with remote controls to decide what um we would like to see in a convenient , practical , nice remote control . 
UNKNOWN Um so do we have any initial ideas for uh how this remote control should be designed or formatted or the the buttons it should have . 
UNKNOWN Um , I think one thing is that it should be easy to find bec yeah bec Yeah , yeah yeah yeah yeah . 
UNKNOWN I was thinking that too . 
UNKNOWN I think we should design something that has like a so you can like somehow like you I mean you always know where your T_V_ is , so just have a call button , I've always wanted that , so like you can push a button on your T_V_ Yeah , yeah yeah yeah , so you should have a call button on your television to be able to find your remote control . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I mean you have it for the portable phone , so why not yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And even I think a little light . 
UNKNOWN Um or even a maybe a vib a vibrating thing . 
UNKNOWN I dunno but someth because it's usually under the sofa . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN In which case you're going to be l but if it has a sort of signal which isn't any sound I don't know if it's expensive maybe to Maybe call is enough . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I don't yeah I mean it but like I mean just I mean like your phone even just has so like it can vibrate , it can light up and make noise and I dunno . 
UNKNOWN But yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah yeah yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN What if it had something like um just like a magnet on the back of it and you could I mean j just to have some place to put it besides like a base . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN You know like a portable phone has a base , like just to have a home for it . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , or if it had a yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah yeah yeah yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I mean Yeah . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause people just stick it on top of their T_V_ , but the point of having a remote is not to have to walk over to the T_V_ , so Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well that's why it's always in the couch . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , in in the couch . 
UNKNOWN I dunno , it seems like though that that would be hard , 'cause you not you're not gonna be lazy anyway and Yeah so we the project is now couches and remote controls . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Maybe we should design couches that have the remote control in the side arm . 
UNKNOWN But even just a thing to attach it to the w you know if you had a thing , a pretty object attached to the wall . 
UNKNOWN But that would really make it more expensive . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But it's only a plastic thing , r really , the thing on the wall . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Something like that . 
UNKNOWN And the other thing is Not well it needs to be sort of Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Do you think it needs to be bigger to not lose , or does that not factor in ? 
UNKNOWN Bigger . 
UNKNOWN Like Hand hand held size , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Hand-sized . 
UNKNOWN I don't think you need a But definitely not well I don't know . 
UNKNOWN Not not huge , but Huh . 
UNKNOWN It can't be that hard to put some kind of a noise on it . 
UNKNOWN No , it can't be , uh-uh . 
UNKNOWN No it really wouldn't be . 
UNKNOWN Or like or like a light thing . 
UNKNOWN You know . 
UNKNOWN I dunno . 
UNKNOWN Like spaceship . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Um Oh dear . 
UNKNOWN Or make it mobile so it runs around and comes come find you yeah . 
UNKNOWN That would be really I'm sure we could do that for twenty five Euros a pop . 
UNKNOWN Little homing device . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Uh . 
CONFUSION Um . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So what do we think this remote control should Five minutes . 
UNKNOWN Till the meeting oh right . 
UNKNOWN This is what we have left . 
UNKNOWN I also think though that it shouldn't have too many buttons , 'cause I hate that when they have too many buttons and I mean I know it has to have enough functions but like , I don't know you , just have like eight thousand buttons and you're like , no , you never use half of them . 
UNKNOWN Um , oh we just Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I agree . 
UNKNOWN B_ button and the F_ button , they don't do anything . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah yeah . 
UNKNOWN You what if um may be a little fancy but what if it had like a little screen , so it has less buttons but it still has all the functions . 
UNKNOWN So . 
UNKNOWN That would be cool . 
UNKNOWN Like the way a mobile phone does . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I mean it just seems like yeah . 
UNKNOWN So you could like um like if you have I dunno if you have satellite if you have a hundred channels , you can the way you do it on your radio is that you uh what do you call it s y yeah but you can programme , so you can programme like your favourite channels , so like if you had a s That's something we could decide . 
UNKNOWN Select . 
CONFUSION Uh . 
UNKNOWN But , would you have the screen on the thing , or would you have it on the telly transmitting the screen . 
UNKNOWN I guess they would go together somehow ? 
UNKNOWN Because Because , I don't know if it's I think it's e expensive , if you have if you use the telly screen , 'cause the telly's already a screen , then you can pro sort of have a programming function , really easy sort of arrow up and down , on the remote , and then use the telly as a screen . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN I dunno . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN But um But yeah for sure . 
UNKNOWN I'm thinking kind of Or like you h you see those you know people I'm thinking of like celebrity cribs kind of things when like they have all those these things that at their house you know their their entire house is so electronic , and they have like this one master control that and it's like a hand held like turns on everything sort of control and it has like a screen and like so I think it should be possible to have some kind of a screen , I don't know if it must be it would probably must be ex too expensive though t like I dunno . 
UNKNOWN Something like not it's not on the button but it's telling you what to do , is that what you mean ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But like mobile phones have screens and they're cheap . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah that's true . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I mean , we have to remember our budget is twelve point twelve fifty for to actually make the device . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Um but it's something to think about , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well , I guess we have to get to that later , yeah . 
UNKNOWN I mean we'll have to see how much that would be . 
UNKNOWN Or some it i we can find out probably on the internet how much it's Um . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , and the other thing you said that thing about robust and water um What was the word ? 
UNKNOWN Furry . 
UNKNOWN Water resistant . 
UNKNOWN Oh I was just Yeah . 
UNKNOWN No but it's I thought , ah , spot on . 
UNKNOWN Good feel , tact tactile , good tactile feel , maybe something didn doesn't make your hands sweat lot . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Mm , mm . 
UNKNOWN That's quite annoying . 
UNKNOWN Maybe um just like a simple thing to have a clip on it , like so you can clip it to your like that's another Um . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , clip . 
UNKNOWN Ooh . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN We should probably start wrapping up , um we've got some initial ideas that we can all look into . 
UNKNOWN Um , and come up with some new ones for the next meeting , which will be in another thirty minutes . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN So . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN The Industrial Designer , what does that stand for , I_D_ , yeah um is going to be looking more into the working design . 
UNKNOWN Yeah I think so . 
UNKNOWN So I guess you'd be looking at lots of the things we discussed about screen and um that sort of thing . 
UNKNOWN The something , what is the U_I_ ? 
UNKNOWN User . 
UNKNOWN That's me . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , what does it stand for again ? 
UNKNOWN Uh , User Interface design . 
UNKNOWN User Interface Designer . 
UNKNOWN So that's gonna be more technical . 
UNKNOWN I guess that maybe the working design has also to do with like the physical feat like just the way it looks and the way it w Yeah , yeah . 
UNKNOWN So technical function . 
UNKNOWN The working design is the structure . 
UNKNOWN What is technical functions exactl I I don't really know what It does but it I just don't really Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um , I guess you'd have to find out . 
UNKNOWN It says on that emailbut it It said um It said Yeah like Be a medium between you and the telly I think , that's uh Marketing . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN It was in the email. 
UNKNOWN I wrote down what mine were . 
UNKNOWN What effect should the thing ha should it have , okay . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
UNKNOWN And working design . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
UNKNOWN And how it works , okay . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN I'm I'm on task . 
UNKNOWN And the M_E_ , what does that stand for ? 
UNKNOWN M Marketing , right . 
UNKNOWN Marketing . 
UNKNOWN Oh it's written here , but um . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN So we'll be working on the user requirements , um Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So I guess that wraps it up . 
UNKNOWN I'll see you all in thirty minutes . 
UNKNOWN I just did . 
UNKNOWN 'Kay so we'll try to zip through this , since we're short on time . 
UNKNOWN Welcome everybody . 
UNKNOWN Um hope your sessions went well . 
UNKNOWN Um so this is our functional design meeting , we're going to consider um user needs , technical effects , and the working design of our remote control . 
UNKNOWN Um I've been taking meetings on the minuteminuteson the meetings , and I'll be putting them in the shared documentsfolder so if there's anything you need to refer to you can find them in there . 
UNKNOWN Um I I'll get the ones up for next time , um they're not finished yet . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Um so can we have updates from everyone from what you've worked on just kind of a quick summary of anything interesting that you'd like to share or discuss in this sure . 
UNKNOWN And I can start if you want . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Is there an order ? 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN We haven't decided on an order . 
UNKNOWN Hm ? 
UNKNOWN No , any any order's fine . 
UNKNOWN First . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um , how do I put this I'll just put the cable in . 
UNKNOWN Just uh You may need to But sometimes you have to do it it's like a three set setting cycle , so press it a couple times , hold down function and then press F_ eight . 
UNKNOWN Oh yeah , sorry . 
UNKNOWN Is that it ? 
UNKNOWN Can you see ? 
UNKNOWN Oh , here . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So what happens it doesn't work ? 
UNKNOWN It sh it takes a few seconds I think . 
UNKNOWN Who's that ? 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN Is it in the right thing ? 
UNKNOWN Oh wait , um . 
CONFUSION Uh . 
UNKNOWN You need to help me . 
UNKNOWN Uh-huh , and then press function . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN and F_ eight . 
UNKNOWN . 
UNKNOWN Could you just plug it back into hers because she had oh . 
UNKNOWN Oh , wait . 
UNKNOWN That's is that it ? 
UNKNOWN Adjusting . 
UNKNOWN Here we are . 
UNKNOWN The cable might be a little loose or something . 
UNKNOWN Right here we are . 
UNKNOWN Oh , you got it . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN Is it on ? 
UNKNOWN We're here . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Okay , um . 
UNKNOWN In order to see what the functional requirements were to be found , um a hundred people were tested in a usability laboratory through just their habits to n know their habits were observed and questionnaires were given out . 
UNKNOWN Um , the findings in in some cases matched what we were talking about . 
UNKNOWN Custome Customers and users don't like the way remote controls look , they don't like the way they feel , they don't think they match their operating behaviour , and an example is what we were talking about , the buttons , they only use ten per cent of the buttons , so later on there's a study of the buttons that they use most and I think we should design according to these buttons . 
UNKNOWN Easy to lose , and R_S_I_ . 
UNKNOWN I don't know what R_S_I_ means . 
UNKNOWN Um the person that did the questionnaire obviously did , I don't have a clue . 
UNKNOWN Hm . 
UNKNOWN Um , according to the frequency of use and the relevance of each buttons , I have made a list of the buttons that we should focus on in order of importance . 
UNKNOWN So the most important buttons are those to do with channel selection . 
UNKNOWN They're used about a hundred and sixty times per hour . 
UNKNOWN And um yeah so and and people like to zap a lot apparently , so this is the order . 
UNKNOWN Channel selection , teletext , volume , and power . 
UNKNOWN The other ones are the settings , and they're used less than you know zero point eight to zero point five times per hour , and this means that I think we can we could have like a a button for all the settings , and then , just one , and then from there go on to the audio on the screen , either on the remote or on the television . 
UNKNOWN Um , about the screen , and speech recognition , some people are more willing than others to actually pay for that . 
UNKNOWN And if we look at the market , f people from well from fifteen to thirty five year old year olds , I don't really know how to describe this , um ninety one to seventy six percent of people in that age range are willing to pay more for this sort of product , while people that are above thirty five years ol um years old go from thirty five percent to eight percent , so people that are sixty five for example wouldn't actually pay for this sort of thing . 
UNKNOWN Um I don't I don't know um what the decision to be made is , but I think that the people that actually do buy remotes m more are those like teenagers and young professionals and um , most likely , but we should discuss this together . 
UNKNOWN And that's all I have to say about the matter , um . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN Shall I what do I do ? 
UNKNOWN Do I give this to someone else ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Just move right on . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN So get this . 
UNKNOWN Okay so now I need to press F_ eight , what is it ? 
UNKNOWN Uh function F_ eight . 
UNKNOWN Function F_ eight . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN What's function ? 
UNKNOWN It's the little blue w it's the one th yeah . 
UNKNOWN Oh function , I see it . 
UNKNOWN There we go . 
UNKNOWN Yeah should be It should be yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN This my presentationabout the uh technical functions design and I basically just tried to focus on um just what what functions we need and how to make that the best function for the user . 
UNKNOWN So uh and I just sort of like thought about it myself and looked on the internet . 
UNKNOWN And okay so basically um I think i uh like it is really important that we sort of get this done in a user friendly and fashionable way . 
UNKNOWN Um so I think things like uh you know keeping buttons together that like close together that um are used in the same way , uh or um maybe that making 'em the same colour , keeping the number of buttons the uh leas you know to a minimum , and also things like is it is it um is it uh can you c y small enough large enough I'm not sure we c I guess we would need to do some research about , I would , about what size is appropriate and that sort of thing , um but basically we need to make sure that it turns on and off the T_V_ . 
UNKNOWN Does it have like capacity to change the channels ? 
UNKNOWN Um does it do or do we need to have like functions for cable or V_C_R_ ? 
UNKNOWN And then , is it findable , and uh how do we wanna do that ? 
UNKNOWN And um I just thought that these two remotes were pretty boring , um I dunno if this will work but And I think we can find something that's more fun to look at and use than either of those . 
UNKNOWN Just I mean I like the one on the right better , just because it does have fewer buttons , uh but I mean I think we sh can sort of think about things like um like colour and you know size , shapes , that sort of thing , to best fit the user . 
UNKNOWN That concludes my presentation. 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN You need the little thingy . 
UNKNOWN Ooh . 
UNKNOWN How do I um Right . 
UNKNOWN S That's on view . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN Okay so this is on the working design , which is sort of the uh mechanical functions of the remote , um and the method I used was to basically look at existing designsand incorporate ideas from our last meeting . 
UNKNOWN Um so I think we need two basic functions which is just the basic remote functions , the user can input a channel or volume setting and it will be output to the T_V_ . 
UNKNOWN And also we talked about um a location function where maybe you could press a button on the T_V_ and it would send sort of signal to the remote where it would beep or flash or vibrate or whatever to tell you where the remote is . 
UNKNOWN So the components we need are an energy source to power the remote , um input which would probably be buttons , although um we just talked about voice recognition , processor to take the information , um something to transmit it to the T_V_ , and we also need something on the remote that would receive the location signal and have an output , like possibly a beep or a vibration . 
UNKNOWN And also you need a sender for location signal , which would probably be a separate um thing that we'd have to sell with the remote and people could stick it on their T_V_ or stick it on their wall . 
UNKNOWN And this is just sort of an overview of how the remote works . 
UNKNOWN Power comes from the battery , goes to the chip , um and then it is sent from there to an infrared bulb which is probably the easiest way to send to the T_V_ . 
UNKNOWN And then for the location function , you would have a sender on the T_V_ which would output some sort of signal , um we could use I_R_ but we'd probably wanna use radio instead . 
UNKNOWN That signal would go to a receiver which it would process it , and it would be output in the form of a buzzer or a light lighting up . 
UNKNOWN Um so my personal preferences for how to build the remote would probably be uh , battery for the energy source , that way you wouldn't have to plug it in , um a button pad for input , um we can purchase a pre-made chip which will handle all the processing stuff , I_R_ transmitter to communicate to the T_V_ , that's just sort of standard , um so most T_V_s have an I_R_ receiver . 
UNKNOWN Probably a radio receiver to send out location function and to receive it and I'd probably say a buzzer for the location function on the remote itself . 
UNKNOWN So that concludes my presentation. 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN Do you know about like I dunno , you seem like you know about Okay . 
UNKNOWN Mm ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , uh I d I was an engineer before I came here . 
CONFIRMATION Cool . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Well thank you everybody . 
UNKNOWN Um we have we'll discuss that and then I just wanna mention some new project requirements that came in . 
UNKNOWN Um , teletext is apparently outdated , so due to internet popularity , so that's off the list . 
UNKNOWN Um , also our remote should be used only for television , um , no extra internet kinda fancy things , just the remote and the television . 
UNKNOWN Um and also we need to incorporate our corporate image onto this , so um the phrase is , we put fashion in electronics , so let's be fashionable I guess . 
UNKNOWN Um if we have something I mean silver and and gold or yellow are our colours , so if we had a like a kind of silver one like you saw , and yellow writing , something like that . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN So we need to make some decisions on the remote control functions . 
UNKNOWN Um , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Do Let's I guess we should yeah make some kind of brainstorming , see what we can wha what um well probably our target group and how it's gonna going to appeal to our target group and I dunno the the s the buttons and what it does and that sort of thing . 
UNKNOWN Like in terms of how it looks , or like what it does ? 
UNKNOWN How it looks or the the buzzer you mean , yeah , for sure , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So . 
UNKNOWN So Is our target group then people so do we wanna go ahead and design this thing with the finder button ? 
UNKNOWN So Okay . 
UNKNOWN I think that seems to yeah . 
UNKNOWN It's easy to implement . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN So the yeah , yeah , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Locator . 
UNKNOWN So then our target age group would be the nineteen to thirty five range , what was it ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , teenagers and young professionals . 
UNKNOWN Well that's for speech recognition . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN Well I was thinking about that but uh I mean speech recognition is really hard to programme , and also , if the T_V_ is on it's making sound and the people on the T_V_ are talking , and if somebody says like one , then the T_V_'s gonna switch itself to channel one , or it seems like a silly , I'm not sure how you would implement it . 
UNKNOWN Oh , uh . 
UNKNOWN And screen . 
UNKNOWN That's only for speech recognition and screen . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah yeah yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN I mean I just put the values in . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And if if you consider our budget , it probably if you consider our budget , to h have speech recognition programmed in every single remote might be a little pricey . 
UNKNOWN But um the screen is the same as what , Yeah , I'm happy with that . 
UNKNOWN It's a cool idea but Well you would have to have a button on a T_V_ or on your wall or some place since the T_V_ already has power . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Completely . 
UNKNOWN Hu yeah . 
UNKNOWN Right so um yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay so are we gonna have just some kind of a like we'll have the buzzer on the som like on the T_V_ itself . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah you click the button , it's gonna send out a signal , and I was thinking , I_R_ is line of sight , so unless the remote is like actually in front of the T_V_ it's not gonna work , um so probably like a radio signal like on a on a cell phone . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Sends out a signal and then the the remote hears the signal and so it beeps probably . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So you you'd need like a separate base for that or like something you can right . 
UNKNOWN It would have to be sold separately because if the sender's on the remote then you'd have to find the remote first to click the button to find the remote . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah . 
UNKNOWN So do you plug it in the T_ you plug it in T_V_ , this thing ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , it'd probably just stick it on your T_V_ so if you need to find the remote , click the button . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So it's now like a two-part thing . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , so it would be a two part package . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So we get to design that too . 
UNKNOWN Make it fashionable . 
UNKNOWN Um , okay . 
UNKNOWN So do you think even though we're not talking about speek speech recognition our target group should still be teenagers and young professionals . 
UNKNOWN Yeah I think so . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Huh . 
UNKNOWN Just there . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Are we um should that thing be on the thing to put the you s you talking about a home for it . 
UNKNOWN Do you still want to build a little thing next to the telly or to p hang on the wall or shall we leave that for now ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN We probably leave that . 
UNKNOWN I mean I guess one takes care of the other , like um if you can yeah if you can call it then it's Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Then it can live anywhere . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN For the so you have that button , that so there's is there a light or shall we leave just have a radio ? 
UNKNOWN Um on the T_V_ or on the phone ? 
UNKNOWN Are we just having a radio ? 
UNKNOWN On the phone . 
UNKNOWN Um it seemed like a a beep seemed the most reasonable to me , I think that's what the phone has , I mean when you need to find your phone , you just have someone call it and it starts ringing somewhere and then you can figure out that it's in the couch or wherever . 
UNKNOWN T So i Yeah . 
UNKNOWN You don't need a light . 
UNKNOWN Yeah yeah yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And like if the if the phone's under the couch , you might not see the light , so yeah . 
UNKNOWN You can hear it's under the couch yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um , So need the other buttons . 
UNKNOWN So we have this mm . 
UNKNOWN So I mean the two remotes that you had shown r I don't remember who showed them , yeah you you did um , they're I mean one looked like it was for V_C_R_ type thing , and the other looked like just television . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN That was that was me . 
UNKNOWN I think w I think they're both sort of just like general remo they're both general remotes . 
UNKNOWN Oh really . 
UNKNOWN And uh Yeah . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause that that is something we have to decide , is whether we want to have V_C_R_ capabilities . 
UNKNOWN Does anyone know if V_C_R_s are the same across international ? 
UNKNOWN They're not no . 
UNKNOWN They're not , no . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so you'd need like a whole different set of buttons for everybody's V_C_R_s . 
UNKNOWN S Um Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's right , yeah . 
UNKNOWN It not V_H_S_ here ? 
UNKNOWN But D_V_D_ probably is . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , other than that region and coding thing . 
UNKNOWN But V_C_R_s Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And and if we're if we're targeting young professionals and teenagers , I mean it's gonna be D_V_D_ type , that's the the technology these days . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , for sure . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So . 
UNKNOWN Okay , let's see if I can I think still though , it shouldn't be that hard to take like just reduce the number of buttons you know , like 'cause if you just have like one menu button , that works like with a you know , or you can just kind of scroll through the options u that come up on the T_V_ . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well for sure we need the um I think we can just design the channels ? 
UNKNOWN I mean power's just a button , and it's not used that much , s and it's usually that red and I think it's quite nice to keep it like red . 
UNKNOWN S Huh . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN You know , I've seen some remotes that where you just hold one , like if you hold one down it's it's a different colour than the other buttons but that turns it on . 
UNKNOWN So you don't actually have a separate power button , it's just But It might be confusing . 
UNKNOWN Oh okay , yeah . 
UNKNOWN It seems like that would be hard though . 
UNKNOWN I mean , like because unless you know yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Just 'cause I wouldn't I would probably pick it up and just be like uh why is there no on button . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Besides you like to be able to go power . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I never think to hold something down . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I have the power I guess . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN B Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So we definitely want a power button and numbers . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Well even um iPod thing , like um , I don't know if people like this but if you want to reduce the number , of buttons , instead of having like one to nine , have a sort of scrolling I don't know . 
UNKNOWN That sort of like joystick flat touch thing , yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Because people li seem now the iPod's out people seem to like this thing that there's no Know you don't have one two three four five Yeah yeah , it's just and it's one thing which has everything . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think that's an interesting idea , 'cause it's cool , it's it's funny like you f like I just I don't have an iPod but like I , you know , I just like started messing around with one of my friend's the other day , and you just sort of and it's funny how you pick it up and you just figure out how to use it quite easily , like it's not that hard , you know . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , and it is yeah . 
UNKNOWN It is really but do you need a screen then , do you have to have a screen then ? 
UNKNOWN Well can't it tell the like can't you if you you can have the number on the telly going like one two three four five once you scroll and then It's like l this like that , and then you do that . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , you can have the number going around in the corner . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay so we have this like scrolling sort of button . 
UNKNOWN Oh that's gonna Is that like on on a mouse pad where like kind of okay . 
UNKNOWN Like a disc . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It's like it's just like the same technology as a mouse pad . 
UNKNOWN I've never used one . 
NEGATION No . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah and then . 
UNKNOWN And then you can have um if you actually just want to zap , you can have like a thing like that , and that , and then it can just be plus and minus . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So like it's like a little part of the circle that Or it oh so it's just a region of the circle that you can zap . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , you can Yeah , click o actually click on to have Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well i We could we could even have four buttons , like , if that's the if that's the mouse , you could have the volume and the channel changers just like on that as well . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So volume could be like the top it and the bottom So do you need to okay . 
UNKNOWN Doesn't it rotate though , so it'll be moving around . 
UNKNOWN Well y you have to you have to like be able to change the function of it to like I mean like okay , 'cause so I dunno , I guess Okay so when you g scroll your thumb like around it , it'll s like say you're go you're going clockwise . 
UNKNOWN What do you mean the function ? 
UNKNOWN That that means you're gonna go up the channels , and then you scroll the other way and it'll go down . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN But then so if you wanna switch to the to u do you have to switch to a function where like y so you're either in that mode or you're in the mode where like it just has like the four like you know this is channel that way , that's that way and volume is up and down . 
UNKNOWN Yeah but it knows for some reason . 
UNKNOWN It just It just kno the iPod knows . 
UNKNOWN The iPod knows . 
UNKNOWN S Yeah . 
UNKNOWN If it works on an iPod then it works . 
UNKNOWN Huh . 
UNKNOWN So you just you just can either do this or like you can just touch it if you want . 
UNKNOWN I don't have one . 
UNKNOWN Well for the volume you have to press the middle , and then go up . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN That's what I mean . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Okay so you have to like press this middle region and then you can scroll up , go up and down . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN And then well if you do that it goes , but if you like that makes more sense 'cause there's already ones with up and down here , that I've seen . 
UNKNOWN So it's like holding You can o And you you is there an extra actual button ? 
UNKNOWN Or are you actually you're just using the mouse to go up and down . 
UNKNOWN Well what you for the iPod you press an w right if you're on the channel let's say , then you press on the middle and then if you do that again the volume goes up , and if you do that it goes down . 
UNKNOWN Like Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN It's like a b Like I think we can go on the fact that it does just work with the iPod . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN But if you wanna keep it with volume here and here , I'm pretty sure Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well I mean if if you're gonna this for channels , right , then y wouldn't the volume need to be separate somehow ? 
UNKNOWN Like you could just have Oh , like Oh you could actually Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I don't know , you could click and then have it up and down , but I think Yeah yeah yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But the only thing is like , iPods are so expensive , like , it has to be is that part of yeah , I dunno , I dunno . 
UNKNOWN Is that what makes them expensi I think it's all of they have so much memory though , that's it's Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I don't think so . 
UNKNOWN You don't think so ? 
UNKNOWN I don't think it's the wheel dealy . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN I think it Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think it's the uh h it's their capabili I mean they it can hold what like five thousand songs or something . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN . 
UNKNOWN I'm thinking we could if if we're hav So ba I mean but an iPod just has that circle thing you know . 
UNKNOWN And they're re-programmable aren't they ? 
UNKNOWN You can put on your songs and then put on a different set , that's probably why they're expensive , they're like little computers . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN S Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well like since it just has the circle thing , you could make it a qui a kind of cool shape , like it could be a cool sort of you know , because it could be circular , you know , or something weird like that , just Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah yeah yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well it could just be simple instead of being a l mass . 
UNKNOWN Because , the other thing , I didn't tell you all my presentation, is that people find it find that it's a big waste of time to have to learn how to use your remote and that's another thing they complained about . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um , what other buttons were there ? 
UNKNOWN Volume oh we've ts just said that . 
UNKNOWN So okay . 
UNKNOWN Channel selection . 
UNKNOWN This is just for T_V_ , it's not for or it is does need to be compatible with Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I A D_V_D_ is simple , you just have play , pause , eject , and menu maybe . 
UNKNOWN Um You know actually our our new project requirements , I'm not sure if they meant o onl use only for television as in not for D_V_D_ or just not internet type things . 
UNKNOWN So how do you switch Okay . 
UNKNOWN Menu . 
UNKNOWN Oh yeah . 
UNKNOWN So I'll I'll check that and update you on the next But we'll hold off on that 'cause But s yeah uh . 
UNKNOWN So like if we had that Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But D_V_D_ players usually have their own remote . 
UNKNOWN That's true , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So , I know I'm not c really clear on what Yeah , yeah . 
UNKNOWN But it's cool to have it all on one , because you wanna turn it on then you wanna turn up the volume , and then you wanna go to the menu , so you don't wanna switch . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah , yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So you'd have to have like I think you would have to have like a function switch button , you know somewhere so like you can you're either on T_V_ , you're on D_V_D_ or you're on V_C_R_ , or you're like . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well but D_V_D_ is only like four buttons . 
UNKNOWN So Yeah , but I mean like to switch the fun so like to switch the function of the little circle disc , the touch pad . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , it is only fun Okay . 
UNKNOWN But i Yeah . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN But I think the circle only does channel isn't applicable to D_V_D_ really 'cause you don't wanna but volume is and volume is actually controlled on the T_V_ so you don't have to switch . 
UNKNOWN Yeah but it it would be So but I'm saying like , does it make sense to have like some kind of a button , so like you're if you're on T_V_ , like you can switch channels , but then if uh if you're on D_V_D_ then like the channel bu like the the region of the disc that was for channels is for like switching to different tracks or s you know , to different I mean do we need to think about that , that like Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um , yeah , let's think about it 'cause we need to wrap up . 
UNKNOWN Yes we can try that . 
UNKNOWN Um let's see . 
UNKNOWN Um so everyone's gonna go finish their questionnaire , uh then when we come back after lunch we'll have thirty minutes of individual work , um yeah , so think about the things we've discussed and bring some new ideas to our next meeting . 
UNKNOWN See you soon . 
GREETING Hi everyone , hope you had a nice lunch . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Alright we're moving on to conceptual design . 
UNKNOWN 'Scuse me . 
UNKNOWN Bless you . 
UNKNOWN Um , I'll just review what we did in our last meeting . 
UNKNOWN Um , under marketing we targeted our audience , and Um , yeah . 
UNKNOWN That was generally how helpful that was . 
UNKNOWN Um , then we considered some design options with how it should look , um , we discussed an iPod-like button system which , uh , we haven't concluded but we're Right , um So , if you all have presentationsto do , we can see what where you've come from our last time . 
UNKNOWN Does everyone have presentations? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN Would anybody like to go first ? 
CONFIRMATION Sure . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So I've been looking at the components design . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Mostly by consulting remote control diagrams from the internet and also by incorporating design ideas from the last project meeting . 
UNKNOWN Um , so we need some custom design parts , and other parts we'll just use standard . 
UNKNOWN Um , I assume we'll be custom designing our case , probably a hard plastic or some other material case , to protect the remote and the locator . 
UNKNOWN And we'll need to custom desi design a circuit board , because the circuit board has to take the button input and send it to the output so you have to design that each time . 
UNKNOWN But once we come up with a design we'll send it to the circuit people and they'll just printit out . 
UNKNOWN Um , standard parts include the buttons and the wheels , um the iPod-style wheel . 
UNKNOWN The infrared L_E_D_ is actually gonna be included in the circuit board that comes with it . 
UNKNOWN Um , we need a radio sender and receiver , those are standard . 
UNKNOWN And al we also need a beeper or buzzer or other sort of noise thing for locating the remote . 
UNKNOWN So we have some material options . 
UNKNOWN Um , we can use rubber , plastic , wood or titanium . 
UNKNOWN Um , I'd recommend against titanium because it can only be used in the flat cases and it's really heavy . 
UNKNOWN Um , and the rubber case requires rubber buttons , so if we definitely want plastic buttons , we shouldn't have a rubber case . 
UNKNOWN And why not wood ? 
UNKNOWN And , hmm ? 
UNKNOWN And why not wood ? 
UNKNOWN Uh , well we can use wood . 
UNKNOWN I don't know why we'd want to . 
UNKNOWN Um and also we should note that if we want an iPod-style wheel button , it's gonna require a m qu slightly more expensive chip . 
UNKNOWN We can't use the minimal chip , we need the next higher grade , which is called regular . 
UNKNOWN I don't think it's much more expensive , but it is more expensive . 
UNKNOWN So that's what I've got on design . 
UNKNOWN 'S good . 
UNKNOWN Um , can I do next ? 
UNKNOWN 'Cause I have to say something about the material which is quite shocking . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Ha . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Right , um , I have been searching the current trends , um , both on the web and via fashion-watchers , and the findings are that the first thing to aim for is a fashion uh , fancy look and feel . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Next comes technologic technology and the innovations to do with that . 
UNKNOWN And th last thing is the easy to use um factor . 
UNKNOWN Um , fancy look and feel goes far beyond the functionality of the thing , but I suppose that is included in in the ease of use . 
UNKNOWN Um , our fashion-watchers in Milan and Paris have decided , well noticed , that f the fruit and vegetable theme is the is the current trend and and therefore um we need to go for that if we want , you know , wh whatever our motto is . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN For fashion , we go for fashion . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN The fashion in electronics . 
UNKNOWN So we want to put the fashion electronics , we need to go fruit and vegetables . 
UNKNOWN And also go for a spongy feel , so the the question of our technology whate is Industrial Designer . 
UNKNOWN As to the material should be limited to I don't know how spongy it can be , should discuss this together , I don't know how spongy can be achieved but apparently that's the way to go . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN I I have been thinking about this fruit and vegetable thing and I prefer fruits to vegetables , but that's just a personal opinion . 
UNKNOWN I think I think people like to have a fruit instead of a vegetables in their sitting room . 
UNKNOWN Uh those are just suggestions and also we need to decide whether this should be printed , so that still has to do with the material discuss should we printthe fruit stuff , or should the actual remote look like a fruit ? 
UNKNOWN Um , and finally again with the spongy . 
UNKNOWN It has to be technologically innovative so maybe again our Industrial Designer should look into that or find come up with a solution that's better than mine . 
UNKNOWN Um , yeah , to summarise these are the points that need to be um , touched in order to get a good decision , and hopefully our User Interface has more to say about the matter . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
THANKS Thank you for your attention . 
UNKNOWN So . 
UNKNOWN I think it's the next it's the blue one , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Oh , uh , there we go . 
CONFUSION Uh . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Well so that fruit and vegetables thing huh . 
UNKNOWN I actually wasn't aware of the new trends in electronics and and uh So so okay , let me get this right . 
UNKNOWN Neither was I . 
UNKNOWN Well it's a trend in fashion , in clothing and um fabrics . 
UNKNOWN Yeah but you're not gonna wear your remote control . 
UNKNOWN Okay , uh Okay , alright anyway . 
UNKNOWN Um here we go . 
UNKNOWN Conceptual User Interface . 
UNKNOWN Trying we're gonna try to talk about , um what kind of uh how people are actually going to be using this iPod-ish remote control , based on fruit vegetable design . 
UNKNOWN And , um , basically , so , this is a touched ba a touch-based graphical interface system . 
UNKNOWN Uh , so people are going to be looking at this little screen . 
UNKNOWN Um , kind of I mean I assume , are we still on the screen idea ? 
UNKNOWN Oh we s hadn't discussed it last time . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause if we're gonna have to ha if we have this it just seems like in order to have someone going around and using the um the wheel you it seems like you would need a screen . 
UNKNOWN You need a screen for it ? 
UNKNOWN You need a screen with music because you're looking for a specific song , like you know that band or whatever . 
UNKNOWN But like if you think about it yeah but if so is it just okay . 
UNKNOWN With T_V_ channels it's , you know , one two three . 
UNKNOWN So Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So , b you you're gonna have to switch to like D_V_D_ and like other things like that , aren't you ? 
UNKNOWN We're , um , we're actually not having D_V_D_ , that was one of th I I was sorry , I I meant to update you on that . 
UNKNOWN Are we Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN But the screen can come up on the telly , the she said . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN That correct ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So anyway if well we just we need to Okay so if we're not gonna have a screen I think I was thinking okay . 
UNKNOWN So basically it's just gonna be a wheel then ? 
UNKNOWN And you're just gonna I mean I think you're gonna have to have some kind of a right . 
UNKNOWN Graphical interface ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah like you're g yeah like you're gonna have to be able to switch to like a mode where you can okay we're not choosing that , I guess . 
UNKNOWN Uh on the you can have it on the telly though . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But like choose channel control , like if you wa Because people aren't gonna be able to have like , um , you know , channels one two three four five six seven eight nine . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So that people seems to be well You know . 
UNKNOWN You've Yeah , I know what you're saying , you have to But but imagine someone with s But i what if you have satellite and you have like two hundred channels . 
UNKNOWN But you're gonna have to scroll to get channels . 
UNKNOWN So um I guess that's wh why I was thinking you may need to have some kind of a screen because So that people can go arou go back and forth and choose if or or then again if you just I guess I c I can see like some kind of a thing where like you sort of have like the number come up on the T_V_ like what channel you're on . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah , yeah . 
UNKNOWN You can just scroll and you can just get to like five or like twelve or I oh yeah ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah . 
UNKNOWN My flatmates actually had one with a wheel , and it it did show up on the T_V_ . 
UNKNOWN Then to get to channel one eighty nine you have to Yeah . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause you'll have to like but you can quickly s you can Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN They have to r wheel really fast . 
UNKNOWN But I think the wheel goes through like a hundred channels , at least on theirs . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah if you do , it w so it would have to be you I mean so you basically just kinda need to figure out like what kind of , you know , range we need to have on the wheel , and um So you're either you're you know , th you're either doing this motion to like control the channels or like once once you stop that , you know , you can like tap for , um , different uh , whatchamacallits , different um , you know , functions like volume or , like you can tap just to get to different channels . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Like if you just wanted to go to like from five to six you could tap or someth And then there's also the concern about you know um how do you get to the menu if you wanna change the brightness of your television , or if you want to um you know switch around , I don't know , like , these different modes like turn on the timer or like something something like that , like I would think so too , like So I mean and it seems it w it does seem a little silly to have this screen if you hardly are ever using it , you know , because but then again it would it does make kind of if the screen's sort of just like an option that , like , is just there and you're not really using it , that's kind of m yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Yeah I mean with that many options , you'd uh I'd think that the screen would be better , because you could have that menu option , sort of Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It's more expensive according to the design people . 
CONFUSION Uh . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's the only thing though . 
UNKNOWN You have to get a an advanced chip if you wanna have a screen in , which is more expensive than the regular chip , which is more expensive than the minimal . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So then basically it has to have some way to get to get to a mode on the television where you're doing , um You can get to you know , you can Like maybe it'll be that central button that , like , then you hit that and then you can it brings up like the menu on the T_V_ and you can just scroll around , like , to do the timer , to do the yeah , yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So the T_V_ is the screen , that yeah So it would have all these different options of changing to Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But the remote itself isn't really cluttered up . 
UNKNOWN Look it even has settings . 
UNKNOWN Hmm ? 
UNKNOWN On the you can just take theirs and just Yeah but should be comfortable . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , well we don't want the screen I guess , but um 'cause that just it does seem like , it that would be , like , incredibly expensive , but I dunno , and then so , it just im really all you need is , like , this little wheel then , and you can control everything . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um , right . 
UNKNOWN What if I mean , if you're thinking of the design of it now , like the a you know , physical attributes , um , and you just have this , it's like just a long silver thing , or whatever we're thinking . 
UNKNOWN I mean are you you gonna have any buttons on that besides power and this thing ? 
UNKNOWN Or Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It doesn't seem that you would need anything besides pow I mean and the power button could even be like hold down the menu button for like longer than one second and it turns on the T_V_ . 
UNKNOWN So can we imagine that this would be smaller than the remote controls that you showed us before . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I mean okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah definitely . 
UNKNOWN Like , I think we're looking at something that could be , like like even maybe like a cir I'm f I'm seeing almost like a circular sort of like handheld like thing . 
UNKNOWN I mean it it needs to be easy to somehow it needs to be easy to like manipulate and use your I mean how do how do I'm not really Like when I use an iPod , I end up just kind of using my index finger to like control it . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I've seen some people just going like that with their thumb , yeah . 
UNKNOWN So Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah I use it like that . 
UNKNOWN Or your thumb or something . 
UNKNOWN W when we had the wheely remote control , we it was on the top I think , if you held it like that . 
UNKNOWN So Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , so Mm yeah . 
UNKNOWN But , were there buttons on there as well ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah well it had the wheely thing and then it had those eighteen different buttons that I don't know what they do . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So we just used the top part . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , so but I mean I think it could be pretty small . 
CONFUSION Uh . 
UNKNOWN Like , I d I mean , you you want it to be large enough that you can But can't you just get K Yeah , But , I mean , do you need that ? 
UNKNOWN What if , um , you had like a b a cover that went over buttons that you don't use very much ? 
UNKNOWN Like you so you could slideit up if you needed to like change the contrast or something like that ? 
UNKNOWN So the options are there but they're not in interfering with the design and the practicality of it . 
UNKNOWN Do do you know what I'm talking about though ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Like , uh , yeah just something Yeah , that you can flip over , yeah , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah like maybe something on the side where you slip a panel down and it's got a whole bunch of Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well you can have it on the settings , no ? 
UNKNOWN If if you can get to , you know if so long as you're able to bring up the menu on the T_V_ screen . 
UNKNOWN Yeah I mean I guess that's the thing is is if w I if we can do this , that'd probably be Yeah , yeah . 
UNKNOWN That keeps it really Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh you wouldn't I don't I just don't think you would even need it . 
UNKNOWN So Mean I mean you can do it , you it's it doesn't seem that hard . 
UNKNOWN So I guess we have to look into the , um , like , the programming , how this how they actually programme these things , and if that's yeah . 
UNKNOWN Oh how they make the menu show up on the T_V_ ? 
UNKNOWN I don't know . 
UNKNOWN I mean it would y would that would be Huh . 
UNKNOWN They already do it . 
UNKNOWN I believe it's ins it's gotta be inside the T_V_ , not inside the remote . 
UNKNOWN I mean I've never bought a remote . 
UNKNOWN I'm not sure . 
UNKNOWN It sounds like this remote's going to be purchased separately from the television , which is a little My I've never bought just a remote , like , so I don't I don't really know . 
UNKNOWN Well they usually are . 
UNKNOWN Well I guess that's right . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN But um So , um but I mean it's I've never had a hard time with like my remotes , like bringing up the menu screen if you need to like change the date or whatever , you know . 
UNKNOWN It always comes with the T_V_ . 
UNKNOWN And I don't think that should uh that should be too hard . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , it most of the ones we've had have had the menu button , 'cause it's not like you need to have a button access to like change the contrast or something . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause it just doesn't come up every day or something . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well so So , do we need I dunno . 
UNKNOWN Well I guess we have to you know think about But I mean you just basically need the output signal you know to be able to bring it up . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN That's what it does anyway . 
UNKNOWN But also if you have it on the screen you can actually write everything out , because the problem with buttons is you like , they have these sort of abbreviations and codes that you're supposed to understand , and I never get it . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , you don't know they mean , yeah , it's like yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Never ever . 
UNKNOWN So Well on the telly . 
UNKNOWN So , but oh , you mean if we have this screen like the iPod screen ? 
UNKNOWN Or on the T_V_ too . 
UNKNOWN On the telly , okay , yeah . 
UNKNOWN So yeah I think , I mean , I think I think the touch-based graphical interface is a really uh cool idea because you know it is so obnoxious to like have to push those like okay now I hit this you know , you have your little guide out and you're like , hit this button twice , like to activate the date . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN And it is technologically innovative in a way , so that fits with the B Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I guess . 
UNKNOWN And it is trendy , the iPods are really hot right now , so Um , yeah , by web research , yeah , so Oh . 
UNKNOWN Did you did you get that pc picture on did they provide you with that picture on the web ? 
UNKNOWN That's quite interesting . 
UNKNOWN What are we going to do about this vegetable thing that I'm dreading ? 
UNKNOWN Oh god . 
UNKNOWN Oh , I was gonna say . 
UNKNOWN You said uh people want spongy . 
UNKNOWN Um , one of your one of the material options is a sort of rubber that's in like those stress ball things . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So , that would be spongy . 
CONFIRMATION Oh , okay , that would be cool . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Ah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Just nice feel , but I hate spongy . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , c that's e that would be kind of oh , you know , usually like the touch pad things are kind of a hard plastic typ mouse type , you know , thing . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But what if we ha what if we had like a spongy sort of like stress balley kinda so you're like Or what if we integrated the the uh the f what if the whole thing about the fruit and vegetables we somehow made it tactilely fash you know , we c tapped into that , so like it feels like a vegetable . 
UNKNOWN I mean definitely the area round it . 
UNKNOWN Yeah I think it could work . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well it could be like mobiles that just you just put a cover . 
UNKNOWN An orange . 
UNKNOWN Don't think I'd want it to feel like a banana . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN If it's a small thing , you c instead of creating an object for it that looks like a banana , which frankly I'm not particularly fond of , um you could just have covers and then your mobile f it's like a mobile phone thing . 
UNKNOWN You know you had there was a time when they had all these different covers for mobiles . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN You could do like the computers where they have like the grapefruit , apple machine and they have like the blueberry , like all the colours are named after fruits . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN You could name it after fruits and vegetables , or Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And it could the colour can fit your sitting room , so if you have red sitting room you can have strawberry , and then if you have a green one you can have well I don't know . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN So what if what this is I'm just forming this idea in my head of how this thing is looking . 
UNKNOWN So I think yeah , colours . 
UNKNOWN If you have like that stress ball material kind of as what you're actually holding in your hand , so like what you're feeling is comfortable , and then there's more of a hard plastic thing where that thing is . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And on that hard plastic thing you can change either the colour or the fruit or vegetable that's on there . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Is that kind of I 'cause I I'm thinking of silver because those are our company colours . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um I mean how are you how are you all envisioning by what we've just the feedback we've just got about the A ball ? 
UNKNOWN Unfortunately they don't have silver fruits and vegetables . 
UNKNOWN I do I dunno . 
UNKNOWN Um That's in the shape of a fruit , like a Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Maybe a ball . 
UNKNOWN Know , a squashy ball . 
UNKNOWN A relaxing squashy ball . 
UNKNOWN That you can p well I see you're thinking , it's weird , you're thinking the opposite of me 'cause you're thinking you change the the hard bit and I'm thinking how do you change the hard would you put a um sticker sort of ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Because I was thinking if you have a cover for the squashy bit , like a Oh , okay , yeah . 
UNKNOWN This is just Okay . 
UNKNOWN Say that's the s say that's the squashy bit . 
UNKNOWN Squashy . 
UNKNOWN Yeah I was thinking of getting a cover for Which is cheaper . 
UNKNOWN That see I was thinking this s sorry I was thinking this bit here would be the cover and like that's your actual thing . 
UNKNOWN Well I don't know if it's cheaper actually . 
SURPRISE Oh .
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN And like this you could have like you could have like cherries and things around there . 
UNKNOWN Oh I like that shape . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um but I was thinking if it was like this 'cause the way you were describing the the iPod and the thi the roll thingy It's almost like your thumb is farther up , so if if you could squish it lower then Yeah , I know what you meant , yeah . 
UNKNOWN I was thinking sort of a single ball shape . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So you're holding a squishy ball and then it has a Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN It's like it has to be s yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah I guess so . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So it wouldn't be very big in either like how big ? 
UNKNOWN This big , and then you just do that , I suppose . 
UNKNOWN What if , yeah , what if the squishy , oh so so you're saying the squishy part's like detachable , and you can so so maybe one you know you can have like the broccoli squishy thing , and then you could have like the banana squishy thing and you could get you could have your choice , you know ? 
UNKNOWN Well just a li I can't des like condom thingy , like a a cover . 
UNKNOWN But well the question is , which one's easiest to change and we can just contact our relevant department for that , and just see what the cost is for covering that or covering that , and for now we can do two prototypes maybe and then hi try and ask users what the best is , and No . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
SURPRISE Oh .
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN That's nicer . 
UNKNOWN I think it's nicer to have a drawing'cause it's neater . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Well that's not very neat , but Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I mean I think uh and I think the handhe I think the handheld part is definitely So you could make that into the fruit and vegetable part . 
UNKNOWN If it's a bit like those juggling balls , you can change shape according to your to the way you hold it . 
UNKNOWN Yeah you could squish it . 
UNKNOWN If it's got sand in it maybe , or something , you it it just moulds to your hand . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So where are the fruit and vegetables now ? 
UNKNOWN We we don't know . 
UNKNOWN Fruits and veg . 
UNKNOWN I guess they would be either in the colour of that plastic face on the front , or in the colour of the squishy thing underneath . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And the rest is the company the company colour's silver ? 
UNKNOWN It was , yeah , silver and yellow . 
UNKNOWN It l it looks like I don't Yeah . 
UNKNOWN We could promote the banana one . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Like mm . 
UNKNOWN I mean that's another question , where are we gonna we we should have the logo somewhere on it . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Should also fit the batteries , which we haven't Okay . 
UNKNOWN Oh yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think the batteries would have to go right under the plastic case . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , th and that would that Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Especially if you're switching out the squishy part . 
UNKNOWN Then you need to have the other part just be sort of a single unit that you can snap off . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I think , um it'd be interesting to have the b the squishy bit . 
UNKNOWN The part that you , yeah , can change into the different , you know , trendy vegetables and fruits . 
UNKNOWN But uh it Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well I dunno . 
UNKNOWN You'd spend so much time like squishing it to your own personal hand . 
UNKNOWN Then you'd get a new one and you'd have to do it all over again . 
UNKNOWN No but it does it automatically . 
UNKNOWN Does it automatically ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I don't know . 
UNKNOWN I don't know what the rest of my notesmean because they were made for me . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN But if someone components concept . 
UNKNOWN Question mark . 
UNKNOWN Energy . 
UNKNOWN Question mark . 
UNKNOWN That was me . 
UNKNOWN Was that you ? 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Oh right right . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um , so what d but what do we know about energy ? 
UNKNOWN I mean we're gonna use batteries right ? 
UNKNOWN Uh we actually had an option of batteries , solar power , and um a dynamo , which is something I don't know what it is . 
UNKNOWN And I think batteries sound good . 
UNKNOWN Something to do with torches . 
UNKNOWN Oh , a dynamo is ah , it's a bicycle . 
UNKNOWN It's a bicycle mechanism . 
UNKNOWN It's the en it's like if if something moves , when it moves , it stores energy . 
UNKNOWN Oh okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , the other one was the other one was a kinetic thing where you'd basically have to wind it yourself . 
UNKNOWN So I sort of picked battery . 
UNKNOWN It's quite sweet . 
UNKNOWN We could have talked about doing a wind-up or a dynamo or a solar power . 
UNKNOWN Um but I think solar power's not available with the rubber case anyways . 
UNKNOWN It it seems a little weird for a living room anyways . 
UNKNOWN What does everyone else think ? 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN The dynamo would be interesting . 
UNKNOWN But dynamo the the fact with dynamo is , the moment you move it , it c it creates energy on its own . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN What about Kryptonite ? 
UNKNOWN Which is quite cool . 
UNKNOWN So if you throw it , it's gonna store loads of energy , and you don't need to buy a battery 'cause they're quite f I find them annoying . 
UNKNOWN But we need to find cost . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Don't know the cost . 
UNKNOWN Didn't have enough data to actually All it said was it gave sort of relative , some chips are more expensive than others , sort of things . 
UNKNOWN Does anyone have costs on the on the web ? 
UNKNOWN It didn't give me any actual cost . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
CONFUSION Hmm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Most of the stuff is pretty cheap though bought in bulk . 
UNKNOWN So I don't think it's that much of a problem . 
UNKNOWN Like the chip is probably the most expensive part . 
UNKNOWN What does chip on printmean ? 
UNKNOWN Um , for things like remote controls , um , they stamp out a chip , calculators too I think . 
UNKNOWN Uh-huh . 
UNKNOWN Um , so you can mass produce 'em pretty cheap . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN But it's not like a computer , you can't like reprogramme your remo remote controls , it's like stamped onto the chip . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN So , chip on printis just means like that they're mass-produced . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN And case ? 
UNKNOWN Uh I guess that's what we've been talking about , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Case is what we were discussing yeah . 
UNKNOWN Casing . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN thinking of like syntactic case and thi um let's see . 
UNKNOWN Is there anything else we need to talk about ? 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Oh when we move on , you two are going to be playing with play-dough . 
UNKNOWN Um , and working on the look and feel of the design and user interface design . 
UNKNOWN And you're gonna be doing protu product evaluation . 
UNKNOWN So you'll get mm m more instructions from your personal coach . 
UNKNOWN Oh , thank you . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Cool . 
UNKNOWN See you soon . 
UNKNOWN Does it matter that I end early ? 
UNKNOWN I it's strange because 
UNKNOWN How how early is it ? 
UNKNOWN I didn't get a pop-up thing that said Hmm . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Okay everybody . 
UNKNOWN Welcome to the detailed design meeting . 
UNKNOWN Um Let's see . 
UNKNOWN Our agenda. 
UNKNOWN Last time we discussed the squishy fruitiness of our remote controls and how we might pursue that . 
UNKNOWN Um and I think looks like we've come up with some ideas . 
UNKNOWN Um and we also talked about materials we'd use and what kind of chip would be necessary . 
UNKNOWN Um so for later in the meeting I've done a a spreadsheetof production costs so we'll take a look at that . 
UNKNOWN Um and see if it's changed at all from when we last discussed it . 
UNKNOWN Um so actually I think Yeah um f you guys wanna give a prototype presentationof Oh is that broccoli ? 
UNKNOWN Okay well um . 
UNKNOWN So our design looks something like this . 
UNKNOWN This being the wheel that you use to uh change channels or volume or whatever . 
UNKNOWN This is a button , serves as the power button if you hold it down , and if you just tap on it I think it brings up the menu . 
UNKNOWN And uh the base of the remote control , which has a squishy spongy rubbery feel , is interchangeable . 
UNKNOWN So you can change the colour , according to your to suit your living room or whatever . 
UNKNOWN And it comes yeah , I can change the vegetable . 
UNKNOWN You could change the vegetable , or fruit . 
UNKNOWN This one's broccoli . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So this snaps off and you can put on whichever one you want . 
UNKNOWN This is not to scale 'cause it would have the battery inside it . 
UNKNOWN This is a mango . 
UNKNOWN The it's trendy fruit , it's not just ordinary fruits . 
UNKNOWN You don't have orange , you have mango . 
UNKNOWN Um I guess strawberry's not as trendy , but So we'll come up with a variety of trendy and exciting fruit designsfor the remote control . 
UNKNOWN 'S a very bright strawberry . 
UNKNOWN It's been a l It's been a little bit difficult to um make sure that it's hand-holdable , and that the user can use it , you know , it's not too big . 
UNKNOWN And then people will be encouraged to buy three or five of them , because they'll need to switch 'em out . 
UNKNOWN Uh but we think that this you know , this size will be okay and we will have to fit the battery case in there somehow . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Oh yeah . 
UNKNOWN And I guess the only other thing that we really didn't talk about was or design yet actually , would be the um thing the locator . 
UNKNOWN How how so Okay so that's just So you have to have a button on your on your you have to attach the button to the Yeah we have that that has yes yet to be designed . 
UNKNOWN Well the locator is just chip that's inside there . 
UNKNOWN And the beeper's also inside there too somewhere . 
UNKNOWN Yeah we didn't design that . 
UNKNOWN But it would be coordinating with that of course . 
UNKNOWN Yeah that c hey that that could you know match the handset . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN You could have a broccoli , or you could have a mango . 
UNKNOWN So . 
UNKNOWN Tada . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN Um if you wanna look in your project documentsfolder , there's an Excel spreadsheet. 
UNKNOWN Um the only one that's in there , production costs . 
UNKNOWN And if you open it up . 
UNKNOWN Um I've just stuck the numbers in , it was a real challenge there . 
UNKNOWN But if I missed anything that we've gone over , or if you see something that has changed I mean , we decided on batteries , and the regular chip would be necessary for the more advanced iPod-like button . 
UNKNOWN Um I said uncurved or flat . 
UNKNOWN I think that's what you have there , is that right ? 
UNKNOWN For the for the plastic part would be Oh . 
UNKNOWN My impression was that flat meant like like one of those square remotes . 
UNKNOWN But it's really not very clear , because you got single curve and double curve and d I dunno what that means . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN One side is curved and then the other side is curved . 
UNKNOWN Well yeah . 
UNKNOWN If we're talking about the area just oh I d I dunno . 
UNKNOWN I guess we'd have to contact the company that makes them and see . 
UNKNOWN Um so what else ? 
UNKNOWN There's plastic for that area around the button . 
UNKNOWN Um and then rubber would be the squishy like thing right ? 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um and lots of special colours actually . 
UNKNOWN Uh scroll wheel . 
UNKNOWN Do you see anything that I've missed ? 
UNKNOWN No I think that's alright . 
UNKNOWN Okay so that would make our total of eleven point nine , which is even less than twelve point five , which means we'd be making even more of a profit . 
UNKNOWN And if we sold a lot of squishy things . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Boo yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN S So Mm . 
UNKNOWN Did y what did you work on ? 
UNKNOWN The Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um evaluation criteria . 
UNKNOWN Do you wanna Okay . 
UNKNOWN I've got a presentation. 
UNKNOWN I think that's Huh , the PowerPointone ? 
UNKNOWN So I need where's the cable ? 
UNKNOWN Right what happens is we have to um decide whether this this whole this whole project we've been working on actually um meets the standards we were set at the start . 
CONFUSION Um . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN This doesn't okay . 
UNKNOWN Um the method is we well I've analysed the user requirements and integrated them to the trends found in marketing reports and in our company strategy marketing . 
UNKNOWN And um the findings were that we need it to look in a certain way , feel in a certain way , and this is everything's listed down . 
UNKNOWN Um , look in a certain way , feel in a certain way , it has to be technologically innovative and it has to be easy to use . 
UNKNOWN These are all things we looked at at the start , um and criteria that have to be met . 
UNKNOWN We have to use a table , I'll show you that later , together to decide whether it meets the standards . 
UNKNOWN And we we have therefore in total um We have five we have eleven points according to which this should be evaluated . 
UNKNOWN And um the cri well basically the findings are the same as the evaluation criteria . 
UNKNOWN I would like to show you the table we have to use . 
CONFUSION Um . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN This is the table . 
UNKNOWN Can you see this here ? 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um so the que the questions I've given you c could you write that down ? 
UNKNOWN True is one and and false is seven . 
UNKNOWN And we'll just go through each point together , hopefully . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN I think if each of us gives an opinion then they can be mixed somehow . 
UNKNOWN I dunno how it works exactly , I haven't been told . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Is it possible that we can bring this up on our own Is it meeting three minutes? 
UNKNOWN Yeah it's in the um it's in the project documents. 
UNKNOWN No it's not minutes. 
UNKNOWN It's called evaluation criteria . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN And it's under evaluation . 
UNKNOWN Hmm ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Cool . 
UNKNOWN You've found it all ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So it was um Yeah true's one . 
UNKNOWN True's one and false is seven . 
UNKNOWN Do you want us to discuss this together or do you want us to do it singly ? 
UNKNOWN Um we can do it separately and then discuss it if if that's what people wanna do . 
UNKNOWN Yeah okay . 
UNKNOWN So it's actually a scale . 
UNKNOWN Wait , one is true and so these are the questions we're answering . 
UNKNOWN Um , yes it's if it's fancy you put one , if it's really unfancy it's seven . 
UNKNOWN And one is One , right okay . 
UNKNOWN If it's somewhere in between you put four . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , something . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Does it feel fancy ? 
UNKNOWN Feels like play-dough . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN They shouldn't really be questions . 
UNKNOWN Should be more like Are the batteries easy to insert ? 
UNKNOWN I'm gonna say yes . 
UNKNOWN Yes ? 
UNKNOWN Very very true . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN I imagine they're somewhere on the front . 
UNKNOWN We have a little case that you slip 'em in . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Are we just about ready ? 
UNKNOWN Apparently I'm supposed to use the whiteboard . 
UNKNOWN Do we um is it necessary ? 
UNKNOWN I don't think so . 
UNKNOWN It's yeah the the marker thing kinda stopped working last time we Our animals will forever be there . 
UNKNOWN We'll just do um Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Un unless you feel you need it t to okay okay . 
UNKNOWN I don't feel any right um Right so one point one ? 
UNKNOWN We'll Five . 
UNKNOWN We'll just go in a circle . 
UNKNOWN One . 
UNKNOWN 'Kay Five . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Ooh I don't know . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN One ? 
UNKNOWN Five . 
UNKNOWN Five . 
UNKNOWN Two . 
UNKNOWN Okay so do we just add it up and divide it by four ? 
UNKNOWN Is that what the company does ? 
UNKNOWN I I think we should Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It's four if you wanna do that . 
UNKNOWN Yeah ? 
UNKNOWN It adds to sixteen , so that's four . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Oh no . 
UNKNOWN It adds to thirteen . 
UNKNOWN One five five two . 
UNKNOWN Oh I thought she said five . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN One five five two is thirteen , over four for now . 
UNKNOWN I think that's um next ? 
UNKNOWN Um three . 
UNKNOWN Six . 
UNKNOWN Six . 
UNKNOWN Really ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Two . 
UNKNOWN I wasn't cheating I swear . 
SURPRISE Uh-oh . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN One point three is Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So it's a one was true and seven was false ? 
UNKNOWN Huh ? 
CONFUSION Uh . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so you guys really didn't like it ? 
UNKNOWN I really Well uh Yeah yeah . 
UNKNOWN Oh I thought it was the other way round . 
UNKNOWN Wait a minute. 
UNKNOWN I thought it was the other way round too . 
UNKNOWN So we do have about the same thing , we just have it the other way Oh gosh . 
UNKNOWN Sh Yeah I I was thinking one means no points , you know , all the way up to the top . 
UNKNOWN It was one is true and false is seven . 
UNKNOWN I should've kept the table up . 
UNKNOWN I'll just I'll just reverse them all . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Well Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It's no problem . 
UNKNOWN Right , well I'm glad this came out . 
UNKNOWN I was like , why did you guys design it that way if you hated it ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I thought you guys hated it . 
NEGATION No . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Oh that's quite funny . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So , starting again , one point one ? 
UNKNOWN One . 
UNKNOWN Say two . 
UNKNOWN Three . 
UNKNOWN Two . 
UNKNOWN Okay , one point two ? 
UNKNOWN Uh three . 
UNKNOWN Two . 
UNKNOWN Two . 
UNKNOWN Two . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um , one point three ? 
UNKNOWN One . 
UNKNOWN One . 
UNKNOWN One . 
UNKNOWN Ha . 
UNKNOWN Two point one ? 
UNKNOWN Uh two . 
UNKNOWN Two . 
UNKNOWN Uh two . 
UNKNOWN Two point I think I missed two . 
UNKNOWN Wait , is that two point one ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah I put it down as one point four for some reason . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN One point four , one point five . 
UNKNOWN Oh dear , okay . 
UNKNOWN Okay right that's I have two of them . 
UNKNOWN Sorry . 
UNKNOWN Mine has all kinds of problems . 
UNKNOWN Two and one . 
UNKNOWN Sorry about that . 
UNKNOWN T two point two , which is one point five . 
UNKNOWN One . 
UNKNOWN Uh three . 
UNKNOWN Wait why did I put three ? 
UNKNOWN Uh one . 
UNKNOWN I meant one on mine too . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Three point one . 
UNKNOWN Is that correct on my slide? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah ? 
UNKNOWN Uh one . 
UNKNOWN Three point one . 
UNKNOWN I have four . 
UNKNOWN Three . 
UNKNOWN One , four , three , three , three point two ? 
UNKNOWN Three . 
UNKNOWN Three . 
CONFUSION Uh . 
UNKNOWN One . 
UNKNOWN Three point three . 
UNKNOWN One . 
UNKNOWN One . 
UNKNOWN Two . 
UNKNOWN Four point one ? 
UNKNOWN One . 
UNKNOWN Two . 
UNKNOWN Five . 
UNKNOWN Two . 
UNKNOWN Four point two . 
UNKNOWN Two . 
UNKNOWN Three . 
UNKNOWN Four . 
UNKNOWN Two and four point three . 
UNKNOWN Two . 
UNKNOWN One , two . 
UNKNOWN One . 
UNKNOWN Two . 
UNKNOWN Right so I put one on that . 
UNKNOWN Okay I'll um I'll just do the calculations now if you want to continue . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Or is it tedious ? 
UNKNOWN Um No no that's um I think we should look at the ones that like where s where people said four , where um it looks like we might wanna discuss changing an aspect of the remote . 
UNKNOWN I'm I'm sorry this was so tedious for everyone . 
UNKNOWN I didn't know how else to do it . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Well the worst ones were three point one . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Do does every ones have the slide? 
UNKNOWN Three point one . 
UNKNOWN The that was material . 
UNKNOWN Slideshow . 
UNKNOWN Material technologically innovative , okay . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Um , do you want to change it ? 
UNKNOWN What are the suggestions ? 
UNKNOWN I don't know , anyone ? 
UNKNOWN Um Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Which one is that again sorry ? 
UNKNOWN Three point one ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah that it's three point one was not that good . 
UNKNOWN Four point one . 
UNKNOWN Does the shape See I'm having I'm having trouble imagining the is it uh gonna be the size , like the the controller ? 
UNKNOWN The shape . 
UNKNOWN I think What if we just smash all the vegetables down flat ? 
UNKNOWN Four point two ? 
UNKNOWN It or bigger ? 
UNKNOWN I think the wheel would probably be mm . 
UNKNOWN Because Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And like then it you could hold it in your hand better . 
UNKNOWN I think the base would definitely be larger , 'cause some of these are not as easy to hold . 
UNKNOWN They're kinda smallish . 
UNKNOWN No but I imagine even if it was bigger , like if it's round and it's big then you you can't get that's why remote controls are long because you have that thumb kind of so c they could all be bananas and cucumbers . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN The flat one . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um but I don't s I I personally don't think this is comfortable to to sit there , like it's an awkward position . 
UNKNOWN I didn't yeah . 
UNKNOWN But like if if you just squash them flat like and you made it flat But it's still too big I think , in your hand . 
UNKNOWN Well if they're that s uh stress ball stuff they would be pretty squishable . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And would it even resemble fruit that way ? 
UNKNOWN I mean Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah like certain ones you'd have to limit the fruit selection , like you could probably do a strawberry still . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think the broccoli would be out . 
UNKNOWN You could do , although the broccoli is quite comfortable , I have to say , like sorta like a joystick . 
UNKNOWN Yeah that I I when you were holding that before , it actually looked yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN That looked really good . 
UNKNOWN I don't know . 
UNKNOWN So Uh . 
UNKNOWN Are there any fruits that look like broccoli , no ? 
UNKNOWN Not that I can think of . 
UNKNOWN Rhubarb . 
UNKNOWN Rhubarb . 
UNKNOWN These obscure fruits . 
UNKNOWN I think that broccoli is my favourite actually . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh despite the Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think we needn't Huh ? 
UNKNOWN What if um the it was just patterns on like we we chose the shape or the sh shape could be whatever we wanted and then it would just be like a design on the rubber . 
UNKNOWN You know like like just a printed yeah or coloured yeah . 
UNKNOWN Oh okay . 
UNKNOWN So it's just colour , and not necessarily the shape of a strawberry . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN That could work . 
UNKNOWN Or I mean we could even have fruit like around I mean But if we if we need yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I dunno . 
UNKNOWN Yeah and just have the colour match or something . 
UNKNOWN And if we wanna incorporate the fruit thing somehow , there might be I mean if it if it in if it uh conflicts with the comfort of actually holdi holding the Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause yeah no-one wants to hold a remote that's uncomfortable obviously . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Or like I dunno , some of 'em you can kind of think see as like like you could if it was only this you know , if it was shaped like that , and it just had that . 
UNKNOWN But you see the problem is you have to attach that , and this has to be detachable . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So like maybe that's just too big because Yeah it's sorta like a joystick . 
UNKNOWN Well see th the reason the broccoli works is you can kinda hold it like that , which is a nice kind of yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But I mean is there some way we could make it this kind of shape ? 
UNKNOWN I dunno . 
UNKNOWN I guess Yeah . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause like kind of Yeah , yeah . 
UNKNOWN We could make it that shape but just have different colours , and call 'em the different fruits . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Or like even Or even like Yeah like you said , like a joystick like that . 
UNKNOWN Dif Yeah . 
UNKNOWN We went with shape because we were having fun with the play-dough . 
UNKNOWN You know ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Like uh we could do I'm trying to think of other sha like fruits that are oddly shaped . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause that , I think I mean that fits the whole round iPod idea . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN And you still have the comfort of holding it like that . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN And you could like if it's like this , you could put fruit designsand stuff on that part . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
UNKNOWN But I mean it do we have any other ideas about that ? 
UNKNOWN Um Think the critical ones came out to be yeah that one . 
UNKNOWN We could tr I don't know . 
UNKNOWN . 
UNKNOWN Batteries easy to insert for some reason , which can be easily I think that's not a problem any more . 
UNKNOWN The batteries are going in the back ? 
UNKNOWN That everyone gave that a one or a two . 
UNKNOWN Yeah they'd probably be either on the front or the side of the remote . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN The reason I I ga I didn't give it a one I think I gave it a three because I thought you'd have to like unc clip no you could Just like any other one . 
UNKNOWN No I imagine there'd be sort of a hatch door , yeah um like on a normal remote . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN So it would probably either in the f no it can't be in the front 'cause the I_R_'s right there , but it'd be on one of the sides probably . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN I think everyone's under three anyway . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN So I think it's yeah those are the only two points . 
CONFIRMATION Cool . 
UNKNOWN Well Yeah the broccoli I guess wins . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah I'd agree with changing the shape . 
UNKNOWN Um , I was just having fun making strawberries and stuff . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN We were a bit off task . 
UNKNOWN Um so uh I can't think of any So we'll have to like Mm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah I dunno . 
UNKNOWN You could make the touch pad in th in different shapes , but then that kind of re-designs the whole project like , but you could do like Yeah that's true . 
UNKNOWN It might also sort of annoy people if we get used to having the buttons in one shape . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And it would probably cost more to produce , 'cause they're irregular . 
UNKNOWN Yeah that's true . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN I bet having different colours is a lot cheaper than having different shapes too . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Which is why printing might be like just printing the fruit on fruit . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Not really Well we've done finance evaluation criteria , production evaluation . 
UNKNOWN Um so project evaluation . 
UNKNOWN Do you want this and we can all No . 
UNKNOWN I guess we're supposed to discuss um the prod the process of the project and how satisfied oh , oh it's alright . 
CONFUSION Uh . 
UNKNOWN It's alright yeah ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um Did you feel there was a lot of room for creativity in the sort of Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Sure . 
UNKNOWN I did . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I mean fruit and squishiness . 
UNKNOWN How c more creative can you get ? 
UNKNOWN Sponginess . 
UNKNOWN The prototype making was very creatively stimulating and I think we've come up with a product that's fun and meets all the criteria . 
UNKNOWN And how was our leadership and teamwork ? 
UNKNOWN I think it was good . 
UNKNOWN We knew what we were doing . 
UNKNOWN It was a very democratic process and everyone got to contribute . 
UNKNOWN Well I thought my leadership was crap personally . 
UNKNOWN Excuse me , am I allowed to say that ? 
UNKNOWN Well you told us when to start and when to end , and that's all that matters . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN I think you were fine . 
UNKNOWN You did a good job leading . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , well I'm never gonna do a management position , I know that now . 
UNKNOWN Um yeah , I thought we all worked very well together . 
UNKNOWN Yeah we didn't we uh it all c sort of blended quite well . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah I think it more than anything we didn't really have our set roles so much , as we just would be like I don't know , all had ideas about it but yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Very democratic . 
UNKNOWN No spats , that was good . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN Um and the means for like the materials we used , how convenient were they ? 
UNKNOWN Like the the pens , the whiteboard , I mean we used Are you a Mac person ? 
UNKNOWN Well I'm not a big fan of any Microsoft , PowerPointor any of this stuff . 
UNKNOWN No no I never touch Macs either . 
UNKNOWN I just use the Unix or the off market , sort of WordPerfect and all these other things . 
UNKNOWN Huh . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Which isn't very user-friendly though . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well the problem is if you don't like my new computer never has WordPerfect so I have to go track someone down who has an old disk and then I have to reinstall it . 
UNKNOWN So I have all these documentsI can't use now . 
UNKNOWN But yeah I mean I guess it's okay . 
UNKNOWN I felt like my I dunno if it was just my role , but l but uh I di I thought that my the information that was available to me was kind of just like or maybe it was just the idea that we had . 
UNKNOWN But there's kinda it was kinda like okay , I don't really think I dunno what I'm doing here . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN So I didn't really think it was helpful . 
UNKNOWN So I kind of just made up my own stuff and I didn't really like the PowerPointpresentations, so I kind of wrote a lot of notesinstead . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But yeah I d I don't really like PowerPointpersonally , think it's kinda stupid . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I never use it . 
UNKNOWN Yeah but uh Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I can't say I found everything particularly helpful . 
UNKNOWN Like I It Really ? 
UNKNOWN It didn't really yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I though it was brilliant no ? 
UNKNOWN My first bit of information was like this child's drawn picture of how a remote works . 
UNKNOWN No mine was really helpful as in my stuff was quite helpful I think . 
UNKNOWN So like a f Yeah I think so . 
UNKNOWN I mean m my problem yeah , yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think it depends on the role no ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah it probably does . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause my problem was , you guys had access to like they'd put send you to sites and stuff right ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN See I couldn't do that , so I didn't really know what you guys were doing . 
UNKNOWN And when you were talking about it I was just like you know that's wh that's why I seemed so ignorant when when you were j explaining things , 'cause I Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah well mine was mostly made up except when they told me like you know titanium costs more than wood to make a remote control . 
UNKNOWN As if you'd wanted to . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But it must have been quite difficult for them to build a whole um a whole system , 'cause of course they can't give you uh uh anything comparable to the internet for the Yeah , yeah . 
UNKNOWN System . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah I mean , it Yeah I kinda thought that um I felt like I would go and like try to use my information , or like I'd make this stupid little presentationand then like I just would end up talking about something completely unrelated because I dunno I felt like I was off-task all the time . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well I think it's interesting how it all went together , like I had the stuff about how me how rubber's cheap , and you have how people want it to be spongy , and It seems planned you know . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , huh . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But um Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well I mean we really got into talking about like personal practicalit like it wasn't necessarily what was like we would never have thought of fruit or sponginess you know ? 
NEGATION No . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So it's Oh right . 
UNKNOWN If I hadn't been told that fruit was They're pretty cool . 
UNKNOWN But I think that it it might be to see whether people actually all come up with the same thing . 
UNKNOWN given certain information or Just yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , like if everyone's given the same input I don't have a clue , anyway . 
UNKNOWN Mm , mm . 
UNKNOWN Um what's next ? 
UNKNOWN Looks like oh no that's not um It's quite Yeah . 
UNKNOWN What do you guys think of the pens ? 
UNKNOWN It asks about that . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN They're kinda hard to write with though . 
UNKNOWN I wanna s I I'd like to see what what it looks like on the Yeah I think I'd like to um I dunno . 
UNKNOWN Yeah and I I've f forgotten once or twice to check the box . 
UNKNOWN They're nicer than the pen that I'm using , because like your stuff actually shows up here , rather than having to look at the screen and write . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN But even so , I dunno . 
UNKNOWN And new ideas found ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah it's all very new , no ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It's all very new . 
UNKNOWN Like it was the I think the microphones are okay when you're sitting down , but like they're kinda clumsy I guess when you're like when you're s going up to the whiteboard like . 
UNKNOWN Sorry . 
UNKNOWN Oh yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well they drop off if you like move too much . 
UNKNOWN Yeah I dunno . 
UNKNOWN But they're they're okay . 
UNKNOWN But I don't think we're supposed to be testing these microphones . 
UNKNOWN Maybe we are . 
UNKNOWN I don't know . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Uh I think , and I think that uh all this technology like I guess some people must be interested in using it but I can't imagine finding it any more useful than like looking at someone's notes, or like I dunno . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well the thing is , like I actually worked in a company , and I had a role and I had to go to meetings . 
UNKNOWN And like the last thing I would have wanted would be to have to watch a video 'cause I missed a meeting . 
UNKNOWN Like usually I missed meetings deliberately . 
UNKNOWN There's just there's really not that much information that actually goes through a real meeting , like when you're actually at a real meeting in a real company . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Hm . 
UNKNOWN It's mostly like rehashing old stuff . 
UNKNOWN And you're sort of going over general stuff that anybody who's sort of on task should already know . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It's like the there's just really not a lot of information that goes through . 
UNKNOWN Seems kind of like an excessive reiteration . 
UNKNOWN It seems like way overkill . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Like if I missed a meeting I could probably get it summed up in like one sentence . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I wouldn't need to have to watch like a t two hour video with the sound and the transcript and I think I've learned not to bring play-dough to meetings . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I guess it would be it's gotta be worth it to I 'cause I'm just mostly curious about like what kind of person or like company would would really find it useful , 'cause can't really imagine , dunno . 
UNKNOWN How about a p a ? 
CONFUSION Um I dunno . 
UNKNOWN Well does anyone wanna talk about fruit more while we still have time ? 
UNKNOWN Any other ideas for Um we still have time if there's any other input . 
UNKNOWN What what's the end ? 
UNKNOWN Are we are we supposed to um you supposed to write a report? 
UNKNOWN Or we ending ? 
UNKNOWN Is that the end ? 
UNKNOWN I mean the I think we did really well personally , which is why we've you know , gone through this so quickly . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause I mean we've all we all kind of agreed our product is satisfactory , it fits the budget , and it's trendy . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN End of meeting . 
UNKNOWN You have to tell her , she Okay we have to fill in all this stuff . 
UNKNOWN So I think that's all for today . 
UNKNOWN Stuff stuff stuff . 
UNKNOWN M meeting adjourned . 
UNKNOWN Meeting adjourned . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think it would be a good idea , I like it . 
UNKNOWN It's hard enough to get people actually paying attention . 
UNKNOWN Especially if you have food . 
UNKNOWN So I guess we're supposed to write final reports . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause I don't know . 
UNKNOWN All of us ? 
UNKNOWN Well there's al eight , nine . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Ooh . 
UNKNOWN Oh ooh . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Or is that just me ? 
UNKNOWN Right w welcome to the the first meeting of uh Real Reaction's uh um development meetings for our our new television remote control . 
UNKNOWN Uh this follows our very successful entry into the the consumer market over the last year or so um which we want to to build on , taking advantage of the uh the the latest developments in in technology and the uh the latest uh uh feelings in in consumer design and and demand and uh we want to make this the the very best product th that's possible for everybody , uh one that everybody wants , uh at a good price for the consumer and at a good price for the company . 
UNKNOWN Uh and to that end we need all to work together uh to do that . 
UNKNOWN Um and uh b in no particular order because ev everybody is uh just as vital to this project um I'll just go round th the table , Andrew , marketing , um m Kendra with the uh um designing the the the User Interface uh uh and Kate with the the industrial design . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN What's uh the the th th project is is here to do , is is to to get this this project up and moving , ev everybody is is free to uh say wh whatever they want , uh everybody has a contribution to make and uh everybody feel free to interrupt me at any time to to say what you want to say . 
UNKNOWN Um in in terms of the immediate meeting the uh um everybody knows everybody else , everybody's worked for the the company for a while , if if an anybody feels that they need to say more about themselves please do , if if if anybody wants to b briefly give their their background so that everybody's quite clear what everybody uh uh everybody's experience is please do so . 
UNKNOWN Uh in fact I'd I'd I'd welcome anybody to uh say something briefly about themselves , in fact we will do that by by going round the table quickly and and saying what what contribution you you're looking to make . 
UNKNOWN So we'll start with Andrew . 
UNKNOWN Oh my name's Andrew I'm a I'm the Market Research person for this uh for this meeting and this uh project for creating this new remote control and uh yeah I'll be uh presenting information statistics on what people want to want to uh get from this new design , what people want to like and from a fashion point of view and the practicality point of view . 
UNKNOWN Right Kendra . 
UNKNOWN I'm Kendra and I'm the Us User Interface Designer and um I haven't had a whole lot of experience in this kind of thing before but I'm m so I'll be working on the design . 
UNKNOWN Right at least means you haven't got any preconceived ideas so . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Yep , I'm just open to being creative . 
UNKNOWN Yep , good . 
UNKNOWN Uh I'm Katie , I'm the Industrial Designer and I'll just be I guess presenting about the the inter workings of our little remote control and uh yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay , very very quickly , um this I don't want to make this meeting too structured because the the whole idea is that it's a um you know a think tank . 
UNKNOWN Everybody says what they what they want to say , uh and we don't want to be constrained by uh kind of convention or uh uh slideson screens or or anything else um but um briefly um th th this is what we want to do . 
UNKNOWN The the remote control needs to be original , there has to be something about it that uh other remote controls don't have so that as soon as people see it they think um yes that's different , uh I want one , um and that goes along with being trendy , uh uh you know the I want it uh scenario . 
UNKNOWN User-friendly as as we all know , remote controls can be uh uh very user-unfriendly so we want to make ours one that people can pick up and think oh yes that's it's obvious how that works , uh and they also want to look at the price and think oh yeah that's something that I may not need another remote control but uh it's such a nice one I'm gonna have one . 
UNKNOWN And last but not least , or indeed first of all , it it must make the company money , and we make the company money by producing what the consumer wants . 
UNKNOWN The uh the further work to be done is i the um the functional design , uh what it uh what it must actually do , the uh conceptual design , uh how we actually present that to the consumer and th the the detailed design i is uh how we get that into production . 
UNKNOWN Uh now th the main design tool that we have available to us at the moment is is the white board and uh uh let us very quickly do what i what it says in the in the in the prompt slidehere , um In fact I suggest to avoid everybody untangling themselves from the uh the the wires , that we don't do that , um So I I everybody knows what whiteboard is so we'll um uh we'll do a virtual drawingon the on on the whiteboard of of your your own uh uh favourite animal , but le let's go round the table , your favourite animal . 
UNKNOWN Um , badger . 
UNKNOWN Mm and why ? 
UNKNOWN Uh it's it's got nice contrast with black and white and uh I feel they're underdog kind of status and they're , the Make mobile phones and T_V_ remotes to make T_V_ remotes . 
UNKNOWN Uh-huh . 
UNKNOWN Oh right uh my my wife says my beard looks like a badger's arse 'cause of the the white streaks in it . 
UNKNOWN Kendra . 
UNKNOWN Um probably a duck I just I li I like the way they look and they're just nice animals and I like how they can fly or swim or walk around or whatever . 
UNKNOWN Uh-huh . 
UNKNOWN Right , okay . 
UNKNOWN Uh 's horses , no particular reason why . 
UNKNOWN Uh-huh , fair enough yeah . 
UNKNOWN I'm not sure that I've got any favourite animal to be quite honest , I think homo sapien because of their their uh overall ability to uh uh Sorry ? 
UNKNOWN Indeed absolutely yes , tha that's um Okay and uh w we need to keep in mind here that the uh we want to sell this for for twenty five Euro um , we want to m make an overall profit for the the company of fifty million Euros so we're we're looking at selling a lot of these um ag across the the entire planet and and we're looking at a gross profit of fifty percent . 
UNKNOWN It needs to cost twelve Euros fifty to make . 
UNKNOWN Um so we're not only looking at a a very trendy original product , we're looking at making it at a very good price . 
UNKNOWN Um , okay , um would anybody like t like to to start by giving their o um sort of quick views of of current remote controls . 
UNKNOWN Well I think I find a lot of them really complicated to use with all the different buttons and uh it's handiest when you have one that works both the D_V_D_ player or whatever and the T_V_ as well . 
UNKNOWN Um , but that it's easy to if you can switch back and forth instead of having to press a bunch of different buttons and so I think it's is best when they're clearly labelled and you can see which buttons you're supposed to use , you know . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN Any any thoughts about buttons or any oth other way of approaching the p the uh the problem ? 
UNKNOWN Or anybody else , strong feelings about remote controls ? 
UNKNOWN Are there you know , bad ones they've used or good ones they've used or ones that they've lost and never found again ? 
UNKNOWN Um I think it's important that you should be able to when you when you press the buttons it'll actually pick up the signals from kind of anywhere and you shouldn't have to like contort yourself and twist your remote control to get it the T_V_ to actually pick up the signal . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Think a lot of the time , remotes that come with T_V_ players and T_V_s and D_V_ players , like they aren't like an area that's put a lot of effort into , they're very boring , very plain . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Like it's very a very like um making a a stylish remote control would be a very like Easily put us one step ahead of the current competition . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Um what so wh what's in in what particular style features are you thinking about ? 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Something that looks looks doesn't look like remote control . 
UNKNOWN So if you want , something that looks like uh something that makes you think oh what's this ? 
UNKNOWN Like this pen doesn't really look like a pen , but it makes you think oh . 
UNKNOWN Uh-huh . 
UNKNOWN So , sorry that's a bit vague . 
UNKNOWN . 
UNKNOWN Yeah d no I mean do you think there's a risk if it doesn't look like remote control , people won't see it as a remote control um and uh Uh-huh . 
UNKNOWN Uh I suppose suppose that's up to the marketing to to make make people aware of the product . 
UNKNOWN Any other thoughts about um th the physical appearance of a of remote controls ? 
UNKNOWN I think something that's comfortable to hold because sometimes you get the remote controls that are just those big , rectangular things and uh they're kind of awkward to hold onto , so something that's more comfortable that fits in a person's hand better . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN I mean th the thing that i immediately comes to mind is computer mouses which um I mean y you get all sorts of shapes in the shops and s you know some quite fancy ones um than the some from personal experience which look nice but aren't particularly comfortable . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um any thoughts about buttons or flat screens or uh uh Yes , I mean the only thing is if if you're watching television in a in a a darkened room um you need to be able to uh fi find the button buttons easily . 
UNKNOWN Well from the mouse idea you could , remote is a piece of plastic with the big rubber buttons sticking out of it which you press , whereas if you want could all be flat and the buttons are very kind of almost subtle that instead of being raised out of the device uh you push into device you see , like a mouse button . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN I suppose . 
UNKNOWN Easily , yeah yeah . 
UNKNOWN But maybe they could be concave instead of sticking up to have them be kind of down so you could feel them better . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's uh must admit I don't think I've ever seen one with concave buttons , that's uh certainly be different . 
UNKNOWN Um do we need it to uh I can't think of any re remote controls that I know of that actually light up at all . 
UNKNOWN Do we do we want uh Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Oh yeah . 
UNKNOWN Mm that would be good . 
UNKNOWN Like a like a mobile phone ? 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Mm , yeah that would be good . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So , Andrew have you had any thoughts yet about how we might market something which there are already millions out there and that we want to uh uh uh t take over the entire um the planet with ? 
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm , um especially if we try to sell , what two million of them . 
UNKNOWN Oh sorry , four million of 'em , but uh I think if w if we market it as as not as not well this you c you could either market it as the point of view we could have the two we could have parallel marketing s schemes where you've got one where it appeals to people that want to have the new device that looks cool , is fashionable and like you just it's it's like uh it's one that rather than ra I wan I want rather than a kind of a need relationship with the device , but that might considering the act what the device is for and the nature of some people might not like respond to having a device that they just looks nice , therefore they want it so make it practical at the same time . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN I think it's this is gonna have to appeal to people that want device that can enhance their living room uh but also a device that uh is practically sound . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So um , I dunno we'll have to decide which which angle we're gonna go to or both . 
UNKNOWN Okay , yeah , yeah , well I d I think an any uh any facets that we identify w we aim need to aim for for all of . 
UNKNOWN If you . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Um okay well first thoughts on um the the industrial design side . 
UNKNOWN Oh I think it's it's remote controls are kind of a unique object 'cause it's you depend on them so much , but you don't i i it's you sort of just assume they're always gonna work , you don't think of them as a comp like a computer can break down and you're kinda like oh well fair enough there's all these complex things going on , it's gonna something's gonna get messed up eventually . 
UNKNOWN They they just need to be very very dependable because people sort of take them for granted and then if your remote control breaks it's God forbid you actually get up and manually change the channel it just it needs to be very effective , very always dependable . 
UNKNOWN Indeed . 
UNKNOWN Uh I don't think we should make it too small I 'cause I think it needs to it can't be too big like you were saying big an and huge and um awkward , but also if you make it too small kinda like you know how mobile phones are getting smaller and smaller um , it's just gonna end up under a couch cushion somewhere and um yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But so yes dependable , and have a good medium range size . 
UNKNOWN Okay , and um colours , materials ? 
UNKNOWN Kendra , anyone ? 
UNKNOWN Well , most I think most of the remote controls now are either just black or grey , so maybe we should go with something different or be able to I was just thinking of um what they're doing with mobile phones now how you can get the different um what are they called ? 
UNKNOWN . 
UNKNOWN Like the face-plates that you change so we could have maybe I don't know if it would be feasible to do something with that , where you can change the face-plates or have kind of a variety so people can get different different things . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Mm , mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Uh-huh . 
UNKNOWN Have it kind of look how they want to , different colours , things like that , probably just plastic because that's always the lightest . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay that's uh Again I don't think that's ever been done before , it's uh the sort of the sort of thing that would get people uh thinking yes that's something that I haven't got and uh might need so . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Uh Andrew , any thoughts about uh how we might market interchangeable fronts on on the remote control ? 
UNKNOWN Um , well we could either market it together by getting control in a set colour or with like you buy it with several uh like you ge you get the f uh the face-plates with it when you buy or as a separate thing , but uh maybe thinking of that , it's considering the nature of the device , maybe a second thing like a second campaign to market new facials for your to your might go a bit astray since it is the kind of thing where y you generally get one and then forget about it . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Unless you were trying to Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well you could come up with like novelty ones , like they've done with the the mobile phones , you can get like different you know scenes from different movies and stuff on the remote control and sorta stagger the release of them and get people like oh I want that cover on it now and that'll keep them spending money . 
UNKNOWN I think Mm-mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Oh it's that's a that's a good idea . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Right , okay I think we've got um a good idea now . 
UNKNOWN Yeah true . 
UNKNOWN We uh meeting is uh Needs to be k uh wrapped up fairly quickly . 
UNKNOWN So uh um we've got thirty minutes to start looking at the um at the design in more detail . 
UNKNOWN Um then we'll we will reconvene in in thirty minutes and try to get some of these ideas uh uh more formalised . 
UNKNOWN Uh thank you very much indeed . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
THANKS Thank you . 
UNKNOWN . 
UNKNOWN Okay , welcome to the second meeting of this uh design group . 
UNKNOWN Um I'll briefly go through the uh notesof the of the last meeting uh just done in in note form and I haven't attributed anything to individuals , because we're working strictly as a team here and uh n nobody's working equally , so uh . 
UNKNOWN Sorry . 
UNKNOWN Um we we s we saw that the the problems with existing remote controls were the uh b a boring shape and boring colour . 
UNKNOWN Um and and we s we saw that the um what we needed to do was to to make sure the device um controls several items , that switching was easy , that you shouldn't need to point the thing at uh anything in particular , um that it need to be contoured to make it interesting , that the keys might be concave , simply because that hasn't been done before that we know of . 
UNKNOWN Um should have interchangeable fascias so people can personalise it , um illuminated so that people can see it in dark rooms . 
UNKNOWN Um and that people might want it as as in addition to their existing remote controls . 
UNKNOWN Um and that it sh it should just always work , whenever you uh um mm uh use it . 
UNKNOWN And that it shouldn't be too small , mm that it it gets lost . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Now uh uh I'll shortly ask for for three three presentations. 
UNKNOWN Uh before I do that , however , I will go through some new project requirements that um the the management have placed on us and uh will be challenging in terms of what we discussed at the first meeting . 
UNKNOWN Um the uh the ma the management has had it's own thoughts on this and uh the they don't necessarily agree with with what we uh we thought . 
UNKNOWN Um and and then we'll as a result of that we will then talk through the the functions that we see the the device um actually b carrying out , and we have uh forty minutes to do this in and I uh Anyway . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Now , the n the new requirements are um the the management team see that um teletext is no longer of any importance given the uh the rise of the internet . 
UNKNOWN Um and and they want it only to cover televisions . 
UNKNOWN Um now , what is not q quite clear from their directive is whether they mean th they don't want it to cover teletext or whether they don't want it to cover , you know , videos , D_V_D_s , um satellite boxes , which uh I mean we saw as being fundamental to the uh to the exercise . 
UNKNOWN The um the actual wording of the directive is that it should cover television only . 
UNKNOWN Um and on that basis um I I think we we need to bear that in mind , um but possibly uh keep at the backs of our minds that the reality that people even when they uh no longer they don't look at teletext anymore , they certainly do look at other things . 
UNKNOWN Um the device has to incorporate the company logo and colours . 
UNKNOWN Um the the logo uh being at b the bottom of the screen there , the the the two R_s in grey against uh a yellow background . 
UNKNOWN Um now this doesn't necessarily mean that we have to give up some of our ideas about making it attractive to the t to the market . 
UNKNOWN But uh do do introduce some some constraints as to how we might do that . 
UNKNOWN Um it also has to be simple , which to some extent goes along w with the first one , and that we've already said that it must be simple 'cause that's what people want anyway . 
UNKNOWN Um but they also want it to be simple to get it to the market quickly , which um mm uh is is is their choice , but uh um we we need to talk that through . 
UNKNOWN Um okay , so uh after the meeting it'll be summarised and uh um notessent out and uh etcetera . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so we'll first of all mm have individual reports from everybody . 
UNKNOWN Um again I there is no order of precedence here um so I I I'll leave it up to you to who who who thinks they would like to go go first ? 
UNKNOWN Uh I don't mind . 
UNKNOWN P fine . 
UNKNOWN Uh can I steal the cable ? 
UNKNOWN Oh sorry , you can indeed . 
UNKNOWN Cheers . 
UNKNOWN I got a how do I start there ? 
UNKNOWN Oh , if you click on the um uh the one that that looks like a projection screen , no the one to the right of that . 
UNKNOWN That one . 
UNKNOWN That one . 
CONFIRMATION Cool . 
UNKNOWN Well these are functionality requirements from the our our guys down in the the research lab . 
UNKNOWN Took hundred people and covered all the aspects of what um is needed by people and what they want to see . 
UNKNOWN Um everything kinda from functionality and how individual functions are how mu how how often they're used and how much their necessary and stuff . 
UNKNOWN And general opinions about current current remotes . 
UNKNOWN See that , as we kinda noticed , seventy five percent of people find their remote controls ugly . 
UNKNOWN So some kind of a new style should be incorporated that's less ugly . 
UNKNOWN Uh along with um looking less ugly , if it looks better , eighty percent of people said they'd spend more money on it . 
UNKNOWN Which is a a plus for us , if we can make it look better , it'd be uh more cost effective and we can put the price up . 
UNKNOWN Current remote controls do not match the operating behaviour of the user . 
UNKNOWN I can empl I kinda take that to mean as um they they don't uh they , yeah , they only use they only work for the television or yeah like as in in my flat I've got six remote controls for a stereo system , a digital box , a D_V_D_ player , a video player and T_V_ . 
UNKNOWN If it was uh I mean th my behaviour is to use multiple things at the same time and multiple remotes aren't really matched well to my behaviour . 
UNKNOWN Uh again , seventy five percent is seventy five percent of users say they zap a lot . 
UNKNOWN I took to mean that they just they use it a lot , they use it regularly rather than standing up and manually change channels or volume . 
UNKNOWN And uh yeah , uh I think the big issue is fifty percent users only use ten percent of the buttons , 'cause uh wh if we got a remote that like well we'll have some buttons taken off by the lack of teletext , but uh oh and we're going to see uh on the uh that some of the functions like audio settings aren't h hardly ever used and used very aren't considered relevant by the user . 
UNKNOWN So I think maybe fewer buttons , which also make the design look sleeker , I dunno . 
UNKNOWN Uh um yeah and uh frustrations of like people losing remote control . 
UNKNOWN I dunno maybe some kind of system of you press a button on the T_V_ or maybe that's b it would have to incorporate , but like some kind of system where you can f use something else to find the remote control . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Maybe like it'll beep or something . 
UNKNOWN And um , yep , the uh time taken to learn new remote controls is Uh don't want to make it too complicated , easy to use for uh new like first time users and stuff . 
UNKNOWN And uh repetitive strain injury , I suppose we should make it more comfortable and make ma possibly even use have to make it , yeah , fewer buttons , like I was saying about the whole mice the mouse idea of it feels more comfortable . 
UNKNOWN Maybe don't even have to hold it as such . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Gosh , must be some telly addicts out there if they get R_S_I_ from their television remote , is all I can say . 
UNKNOWN But uh yeah . 
UNKNOWN It also asked um if we would if people would pay more for speech recognition and younger people say they would . 
UNKNOWN And uh there was another section on our on the reportfor uh L_C_D_ displays , but the data wasn't there , so . 
UNKNOWN I don't actually know what the results for that were , so . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN May be incrementally emitting , but yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I must say that um the uh I c can't remember what um f you know phone service I was using the other day , but that had sorta speech recognition which worked uh remarkably well , so that is indeed a uh um a thought and it it cuts out uh I was was gonna say , you can't get a lot of R_S_I_ , j just get jaw ache . 
UNKNOWN And uh it would cut out the R_S_I_ as well if you Yeah , um oh yeah , so possibly the speech recognition is possibly something could add into the design . 
UNKNOWN Okay , sorry . 
UNKNOWN Oh , I've got some other things I couldn't fit onto this presentation. 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN You see this okay ? 
UNKNOWN Almost no ? 
UNKNOWN It's sorry it's a bit . 
UNKNOWN I'll read out to you . 
UNKNOWN Uh functionality , uh like people's opinions on functionality , the relevance to the remote and how often they're used . 
UNKNOWN So um like the power . 
UNKNOWN Using the using the d swi the power switch to switch on T_V_ is a high relevance of nine , but it's not frequently used . 
UNKNOWN You see what I mean ? 
UNKNOWN Whereas channel selection , which is very high relevance is used the most . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So m we can maybe even start to cut down on or I was possibly even thinking of a design that maybe some of the buttons are hidden from everyday use . 
UNKNOWN Maybe like uh a folding ledge or something . 
UNKNOWN So that we can maybe go into the channel settings and the audio settings , which are low relevance and rarely used . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN And keep the v volume selection and channel selection very easily Oh yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN It could be oh uh I was just gonna say uh maybe like the flip phones that they use ? 
UNKNOWN I mean Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Have you seen the new mo mobile phones that flip out and they have the like texting , and then the numbers on one side , so you could have the most used buttons on top and flip it out or something . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Hmm , hmm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , like the one that like slidesback and the buttons are concealed underneath . 
CONFUSION Uh . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Should we actually bite the bullet here ? 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN If people really don't use those buttons to any extent at all um remove them altogether . 
UNKNOWN Just remove them completely ? 
UNKNOWN That might be the Maybe i Yeah , have a big kind of like the satellite box or the cable box and have it just go on the T_V_ and then it doesn't matter where in the room you are , you won't lose it . 
UNKNOWN We we could actually have we could actually have a remote control with um I wonder whether we could get the remote control with no buttons at all if we went for voice recognition , given that um the Um now the the age structure we were looking at um I mean w we had usage by age structure , what we didn't have was what proportion of people using remotes were in those particular age groups . 
UNKNOWN Now do we know whether they Forty no sorry for forty five to fifty five age group , uh to put myself right in the middle of it , um u use remote controls to a great extent . 
UNKNOWN Uh yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yes we That would 've speech recogn right . 
UNKNOWN Um no this is for pay more for speech recognition . 
UNKNOWN So , we're looking at um well again , we don't know the relative proportion the relative numbers in the age groups . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's true . 
UNKNOWN If we wanted something different , truly different , then the buttonless remote control w would be it . 
UNKNOWN P Well the only problem I can think of with that is if you've got a lot of people that don't wanna be bothered learning how to use new rem remote controls . 
UNKNOWN If you just kind of take away everything that they're used to knowing , that's gonna be quite a change . 
UNKNOWN But if you just lift it up and say , channel one or B_B_C_ It c well it I can I can see technical problems with that in terms of the , you know , the sound from the television , because if somebody actually on the television says uh uh , you know , I_T_V_ and you're watching B_B_C_ then then it might um change itself , so it probably needs to be um possibly actually need a button on it just to activate it . 
UNKNOWN It might Mm . 
UNKNOWN Or even I mean you could even just have it left on . 
UNKNOWN You could just put it down once on top your T_V_ and never have to Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
NEGATION No . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN B_B_C_ one . 
SURPRISE Oh .
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's true . 
UNKNOWN Oh yeah . 
UNKNOWN Or or something just to identify that you've lifted it up and it's use . 
UNKNOWN And and then just say , oh I don't know , a thought and and then uh I mean that that would certainly be uh truly different . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um 'cause uh you know audio settings , nought point eight percent . 
UNKNOWN I mean if they weren't there , would people miss them ? 
UNKNOWN Mm-mm . 
UNKNOWN But look at the importance of them . 
UNKNOWN The volume settings . 
UNKNOWN Relevance of two out of ten , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Vol volume , yes um th w we need to s identify things that people actually need and and it's a function of frequency and relevance . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN They're not used often but they are quite important when they're used . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And um I would say ignoring ig ignoring power for the moment , um the channel and volume and th w w given given that we've been told to ignore teletext . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh channel and volume are the only ones that uh would appear to be essential . 
UNKNOWN Stand out . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN So we if we can design something that that looks interesting , know , or looks different , um incorporates the the logo and and the colours and um we can still have our interchangeable fascias even if it's the yellow and grey , um and uh I dunno , buttons or or buttons as an option . 
UNKNOWN Uh I just had a thought actually , sorry to interrupt . 
UNKNOWN Do , please . 
UNKNOWN Uh you were saying about um it could technical problems of like uh someone on the television saying a channel number and it changed we could maybe have like an activation word . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause I've seen I've seen this used on computers before , where you just you address the remote , you address the computer , and then give it a command . 
UNKNOWN You cer certainly could . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Depe uh i depends whether um if we want to make this so simple that anybody can walk into the room and lift it up and say B_B_C_ one . 
UNKNOWN Oh I see . 
UNKNOWN Oh yeah , I see . 
UNKNOWN Um okay , I mean you could printactually printit on the uh device itself . 
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm , yeah . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN I mean I'm just thinking of the point of view of peop you could still like lose this remote . 
UNKNOWN S th this I th that's always gonna be a problem I think . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Um and I I I s so I suppose one um could make it so desirable that if people lose it they immediately go out and buy another one . 
UNKNOWN Anyway , sorry , carry on . 
UNKNOWN Do you want to just carry on with or no no , no uh b I was in the middle of in the middle of your reportthere . 
UNKNOWN Oh no I I interrupted you , sorry . 
UNKNOWN Oh okay . 
UNKNOWN Um well , I was just kinda wrapping up there . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I was thinking um , yeah , maybe such things are relevant . 
UNKNOWN Mm okay . 
UNKNOWN We could make things much more f I think the the eighty percent of people would spend more on uh a remote uh that looks better , combined with uh decrease the or take out the limited functio functions that we don't really use much . 
UNKNOWN alright take out teletext , but as for channel settings and stuff it might it might um turn people somewhe peop some people that want the whole functionality away . 
UNKNOWN But , since if we're marketing a more kind of fashionable approach then it'd it would be fashion and fashion over practicality . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN S s we could we could make it dual function voice recognition and still have buttons on it um 'cause we're Certainly could . 
UNKNOWN Oh , we could , yeah . 
UNKNOWN We c yeah , we could even have it as like a yeah the buttons control this and the voice functions control the f things that you would do all the time , so . 
UNKNOWN So uh yeah , if we could uh power on and channel selection and and volume selection , wouldn't have to really Yeah and probably it would look better as well . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah . 
UNKNOWN The I mean the the advantage of doing away the buttons altogether is it makes the thing cheaper . 
UNKNOWN No , it cou certainly opens up the possibility for making it uh , you know , visually very distinctive . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um 'cause you know , it does not have to be a oblong box . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Lined with numbered buttons and Uh yeah , yeah , that's everything . 
UNKNOWN Mm , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay , who sorry , have you have you finished there Andy ? 
CONFIRMATION Yep , yep . 
UNKNOWN Um given that we've already had a extensive discussion uh . 
UNKNOWN Okay well , I can do mine . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Do you want the cable ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , let's see if I can make this work . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Oh , you have to hit like function and F_ something . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN F_ eight . 
UNKNOWN F_ eight . 
UNKNOWN Is it doing Okay . 
CONFUSION Dunno . 
UNKNOWN Uh , give it about twenty seconds , or so . 
UNKNOWN Ah , there we go . 
UNKNOWN Oh yeah , it's going . 
UNKNOWN Oh okay . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so this is just about the technical functions . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
UNKNOWN So the method , I looked online for examples of other similar products and then just kind of was trying to brainstorm some possible design ideas and um identify what the necessary things are , what people are what you really wanna have a remote control do . 
UNKNOWN Um and then there are two different kinds that I found . 
UNKNOWN There's a user centred one and an engineering centred one which I will have pictures of and then we kinda have to decide which one this should be . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So these are the two different ones . 
UNKNOWN This one um this is the user centred , it has uh quite a few mm uh um fewer buttons and then this is the engineering centred , which has a lot more buttons , and probably this is one that people complain about , about having too many buttons that you don't use . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So basically , what a remote control is is you it's to send messages to the television set , you know , turn on , off , switch the channels and the volume and things such as that . 
UNKNOWN And so for this product it's gonna be television only , and then it has to have the uh logos for the company and the colours . 
UNKNOWN And so , for my personal preferences , I think this one is easier to use and has quite a you know , fewer buttons . 
UNKNOWN Um we want something that sends messages easily to the television and I was kind of wondering about this example that they have . 
UNKNOWN It looks kind of narrow at the top , and I was thinking maybe if it were wider at the top , then that would be easier . 
UNKNOWN Mm , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um and so we have to decide what's gonna make our product different . 
UNKNOWN E the unique style , maybe have it light up so it's visible in the dark , um the changeable face-plates , and the lighting up and visible I was when we were talking about havi losing it , maybe to have a button on the television that you press and it maybe if it makes a noise or lights up or something like that , so it's easier to find if someone has hidden under the couch or something like that . 
UNKNOWN So that's my presentation. 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay , can I um I'm actually gonna use the um it's gonna cause great technical problems over here . 
UNKNOWN I'm actually gonna use the Yes , rather than the uh the the traditional in fact , um I won't even go that far . 
UNKNOWN F they probably clip to you . 
UNKNOWN Oh yeah , they might be movable . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Oh yeah , they're all they're not connected to anything on the table , you just leave 'em on and walk around with 'em . 
UNKNOWN Um something like this shape , you know , sort of something that you can that's sort of a more vertical shape , um that you you sort of hold in your hand , um , well I'm trying to think uh uh uh l uh l such as I mean um something you hold up like that , possibly with a couple of buttons like that , but with the the entire top with the , you know , the uh the infrared or whatever source . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Uh so that you know , it's flying off in all directions , so that uh um uh again the n need to look at the the the technicalities of um actually achieving that in terms of whether the , you know , the power requirements of the uh such a source , um you know , compromise the our our need for uh you know , it it being um mm permanently uh you know , available . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Uh whether whether different technology um I mean th all all these remotes are presumably infrared , and like they have been for a long time . 
UNKNOWN Uh we we possibly need to be looking at at at something different , um you know , short range , not like the old uh radio remote controls where you'd change next door's telly when you change yours . 
UNKNOWN Um but uh uh I think basically i if we're going for i if minimum number of buttons is our priority , then we should , as I say , r know , really bite the bullets and and reduce the buttons to absolute minimum , you know , possibly with backup channel and volume buttons and on off . 
UNKNOWN Um and nothing else . 
UNKNOWN Um so that it can al it could uh almost end up like that , but again , except that um you know the risk of losing it . 
UNKNOWN Um anyway okay um so Kate , wh what are your uh your thoughts on this ? 
UNKNOWN Yes , mm . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN Which one does this plug into ? 
UNKNOWN Hmm I think it's all there . 
UNKNOWN That one . 
UNKNOWN H Oh yeah . 
UNKNOWN I can't did you could you see it on you screen when it That's not cool . 
UNKNOWN That's kind of strange . 
UNKNOWN Oh well . 
UNKNOWN Anyways . 
UNKNOWN Um alright , yeah , so um I'll just do my presentationon the working design uh . 
UNKNOWN Oh there we go . 
UNKNOWN Okay um just at the m yeah the whole sort of method of how the remote control works . 
UNKNOWN Uh the basic function of the remote control is to send messages to another sh system , the the T_V_ or the D_V_D_ player or whatever . 
UNKNOWN Um and it does this uh by well , you need to start off you need an energy source and this energy source will feed into an integrated circuit chip and the circuit chip is the part that actually composes the different messages uh within the remote um which will then be sent to the uh the television , the D_V_D_ to tell that what to do . 
UNKNOWN Um and you need a user interface , which controls the chip and thus the messages and uh the user interface is that's basically just you kn the s sorta design of the actual remote which you hold in your hands and what buttons will be on it . 
UNKNOWN Um Oh shoot . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Uh just general findings . 
UNKNOWN Uh what we need uh technically speaking for the remote control is some sort of energy source , uh some sort of user interface , which I think we've mostly been talking about the user interface and the design of that . 
UNKNOWN Um a circuit chip within that to uh control and send the messages and um a sender and receiver . 
UNKNOWN And um oops . 
UNKNOWN Uh-huh . 
UNKNOWN This is just sort of a little schematic diagramof what we're looking for . 
UNKNOWN Uh this just kinda represents the energy source which feeds into the circuit chip uh which maybe then we could have that feed into a switch which would send signals f to um a subcomponent and on to a light bulb between so it'll light up once we start once you start pressing buttons . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um also send signals to the um infrared bulb , which will be the part that actually what ? 
UNKNOWN Sends signals to the the television . 
UNKNOWN And then you've got your happy little T_V_ watcher there . 
UNKNOWN And so my personal preferences I I just think we need sorta big uh energy source that won't die out , uh perhaps some sort of rechargeable battery or a battery dock you could place it in , so it'd constantly be charged , so you wouldn't have to uh be worrying about it running out of batteries and not changing channels for you . 
UNKNOWN Uh a wide range uh sender-receiver , so that you can hit the buttons from basically anywhere in the room , and the channel'll still be changed . 
UNKNOWN Uh also definitely a user-friendly interface um and I think we've all sort of mentioned adding a a locating device on it , so when it does get stuck under the couch cushions , as they inevitably do , you can find them easily . 
UNKNOWN And that's pretty much it . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Uh it seems seems to me there are a number of fundamental decisions to make before we um I think your point about the the big energy source is uh a very valid one . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Um I don't suppose we've got any statistics on the the life expectancy of uh remote controls , particularly sort of independent ones . 
UNKNOWN Um given you know , the number of things you buy these days , which you know , have a a a lithium whatever battery in , that's uh , you know never needs replacing . 
UNKNOWN Um perhaps we should have the the disposable remote control , uh um you know , one some sort of typical usage . 
UNKNOWN You know , the the the battery will last know , five , ten years . 
UNKNOWN By which time I mean when all's said and done , the digital television will be taking over in that time scale . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um uh uh p perhaps we should , know , reduce the uh , you know , the sort of moving parts even more by not even having a battery compartment and uh Yeah , and if if anybody manages to run it down , we'll we'll give 'em a new one . 
UNKNOWN Just having one that's guaranteed to last five to ten years ? 
UNKNOWN Oh , cool . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , fair enough . 
UNKNOWN Um it's , you know , it's what it saves in cost and you know there there's a well , it's actually a marketing gimmick . 
UNKNOWN I mean it's hardly a gimmick , it's uh it's totally practical . 
UNKNOWN Uh so I th think you know the idea of a rechargeable one is um uh unless you're really high tech and it sort of just recharges itself if it's n by , you know , magnetic waves or whatever , if if it Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It could have like uh know like a cordless phone in your house it s got like a base that sits there all the time . 
UNKNOWN Mm , mm . 
UNKNOWN Are are people really gonna use it though ? 
UNKNOWN I suppose , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , people are pro I would think that people might forget I mean people forget to put their cordless phones back on there , so . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Mm yeah . 
UNKNOWN I I th I think Yeah , it's um I mean I know that somei times my my wife goes out in the morning and says oh I should have put the phone on to charge and then then she's had those for so long that if she hasn't worked that out by now . 
UNKNOWN Mm-mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause I only remember to charge my cell phone uh when battery dies . 
UNKNOWN And that's pretty much yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN When it yeah , wh when it's died is a problem . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , when it turns itself off , that's when I plug it in , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah , yeah , so uh um what so wh what what do we think about the um the the permanent mm battery ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , think that's a good idea . 
CONFUSION Uh . 
UNKNOWN That sounds pretty good , yeah . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN Is the uh you know , we we we are really going for the ultimate in ex uh external simplicity here . 
CONFUSION Um . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Um you know , cut cost within the manufacturing and uh you know , if we have a high tech interior , then then that that sh may well be cost effective . 
UNKNOWN Do they make batteries that last that long ? 
UNKNOWN I mean th th certainly . 
UNKNOWN Um I can't think of anything off the s top of my head , but there are certainly things that you buy . 
UNKNOWN I mean calculators for example . 
UNKNOWN They usually have the little light uh source , I dunno what the heck they're called , the but yeah , the little cells that Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , they have that little solar Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Som well some do , I mean th th but there are battery ones that um are you know , sort of permanently sealed . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN In in fact I'd Yeah , uh uh Yeah , I I mean th th this needs going t into the technology a bit . 
UNKNOWN Most of them , don't they have sort of a combination of the two , like when there is light , they'll work off the light , and if there isn't , they'll kick into this battery , so we can maybe do something like that whereas there is a battery , but if there's enough light , then it's using the light , so that it's not actually draining the battery all the time , but you will have the battery there for when you need it . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN I mean the the actual time that a remote control is actually operating I would think is i is is probably , you know , no more than minutes in its entire life . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Oh , it depend if it's uh depends who who's using it , who's just sitting there clicking clicking clicking clicking , yeah . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , some people are Yeah . 
UNKNOWN If , but I say if if people are getting R_S_I_ from it then uh then uh then then perhaps we're looking at the wrong market n Right . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , then they're clicking a lot , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN W like like this um this uh market research thing says number of times per hour that it's used , channel selection a hundred and sixty eight times per hour . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Per hour ? 
UNKNOWN Wow . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN That's a lot . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Oh , I must admit I hadn't um I'd I'd missed that . 
UNKNOWN That does sound excessive . 
UNKNOWN But then again , if you think it of the amount of , you know amount of use it's like That's it's less than a second , um . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well that's right , and and I I don't I don't even know whether the I don't even know whether the s the signal lasts as long as you actually keep the button pressed , or whether it's just a sorta tenth of a second , no matter how long you press it for , I don't know I don't actually know . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Though I think with digital T_V_ , like I know on my cable box , you're not supposed to do that because the channel can't keep up with it if you just press it like that , so you're supposed to use the menu and go through the different channels that way instead of Uh-oh . 
CONFUSION Um . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Right , so I've got a message to say five minutes , I dunno how long ago that appeared . 
UNKNOWN Um 'cause we're we're getting um right , so I'd I need to sum up very quickly here um . 
UNKNOWN We're looking at extreme simplicity . 
UNKNOWN We're looking at a radically different shape . 
UNKNOWN Possibly no buttons at all um , but if you can incorporate um channel change and volume buttons um in into the design , then then that's fine . 
UNKNOWN Um in the I mean the the role of the of the um the user interface des designer becomes b you know more important here , because , you know , shape is no longer an a uh um a serious constraint . 
UNKNOWN But we clearly only need th the main buttons , although , uh if clearly only need the main functions . 
UNKNOWN Um I don't see why we shouldn't go for voice recognition um and the the only buttons that I think we need are channel control , volume control and on off . 
UNKNOWN Um it needs to incorporate the corporate logo , uh the the grey and yellow colour scheme and there's no reason why we can't introduce um interchangeable uh covers . 
UNKNOWN Um uh d so does that accurately summarise what we've discussed ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Um Oh I just have one question . 
UNKNOWN So uh Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So are we doing just the television or are we doing so not D_V_D_ players , we okay , okay . 
UNKNOWN We are doing just the television . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN I think that's quite clear from the the information that we've been given , no ? 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , like in the emailof television only . 
UNKNOWN In fact they're in the constraints emailthat I got . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Didn't you mention the teletext , just television only ? 
UNKNOWN Oh yeah well th that's one I s that's one I sent you , which which was my interpretation of uh of the uh what came down from from head office . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Oh okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Oh yeah . 
UNKNOWN Oh okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um That's that that that that's their uh their view . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so uh we can all give some thought to that uh for for the next meeting , thank you very much indeed . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Cool . 
UNKNOWN Alright ? 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
THANKS Thank you for coming to this third meeting of the uh uh design group . 
UNKNOWN Um I think we uh made some definite progress at the last one um and come up with some interesting uh uh w suggestions for our our new remote control . 
UNKNOWN Um I'll again very quickly uh just present some notesof that meeting . 
UNKNOWN Um the the the problem with existing remote controls , we felt , was that they're ugly um and that people are prepared to pay a premium for something better . 
UNKNOWN Um they've got lots of buttons on them that uh people don't use and find difficult to learn . 
UNKNOWN Um and people lose them . 
UNKNOWN And We we thought that f for our our new uh uh remote control that everybody will want to rush out and buy , um that we're we should look at speech recognition rather than r rather than buttons , and that if we have any buttons they should be very few of them and only for those functions that are actually identified that that people use . 
UNKNOWN That um we want to go for uh a long lasting battery that we gua we guarantee for the life of the uh uh the product and a shape that will be instantly recognisable , A_ um as uh a trendy remote control , and and B_ as uh a Real Reaction product . 
UNKNOWN So that w uh when people are uh happy with that , they will they will want to buy uh everything else from us . 
UNKNOWN Uh Okay . 
UNKNOWN So again um , I'll we'll have the three three presentationsfrom the the the three of you and then uh we'll we'll make a a final a final uh decision . 
UNKNOWN Um and the the decisions that we need to to make today , finally , are um what energy source we want to use , whether i it is practical to use uh um a a a long lasting one . 
UNKNOWN And uh I I think our discussion was around the fact that uh if we're gonna go for uh a long lasting power supply , then basically it's uh sealed for life and uh if anybody does manage to run one down , we'll we'll give them another one . 
UNKNOWN And uh it it'll be uh , you know , prominently displayed as part of the th the advertising literature that it's um um , you know , for life , guaranteed for life . 
UNKNOWN Um now the the the internal chip um and uh this is where I need uh uh Kate's expert advice and given that th this has to to go to market as quickly as possible um d d do we go for a custom designed chip ? 
UNKNOWN Or or do we buy one off the shelf and and programme it ourselves ? 
UNKNOWN Uh I mean I'm I'm I'm n not an expert on these things , but presumably , there must be loads of 'em already on the market that we can modify . 
UNKNOWN But uh that that's uh that's your area of expertise . 
UNKNOWN And then the uh , you know , the the overall design of the case uh is is is Kendra's field and uh we we had some discussions last time as as to uh how we might go forward and we'll we'll finalise those uh da today . 
UNKNOWN Um and thi this is all linked in with the the the user interface , whether we p um go for voice , buttons , or or a bit of both . 
UNKNOWN Uh and then uh , you know , f for the next meeting Kate will be looking at the the the s the look , feel and design , Kendra the uh ho how the the user actually uses it and and Andrew of course the the product evaluation . 
UNKNOWN And uh Kate and Kendra will be producing a a model for us to uh to look at . 
UNKNOWN Uh so , if if we can have the the three presentationsagain please , and uh um p perhaps you'd like to start uh k . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um Um p there we go . 
UNKNOWN Kate . 
UNKNOWN Oh I'm sorry , oh sorry . 
UNKNOWN 'Kay , I'll just be talking about the components design . 
UNKNOWN And Okay , basically I just uh looked at what exactly do remotes do . 
UNKNOWN Uh basically they wait for you to press a key or give a voice command and then this is translated uh into uh light signals which are then seen by the T_V_ . 
UNKNOWN Uh the materials we're gonna need to look at uh the two big ones are the integrated circuit chip and the battery and the in integrated circuit chip uh works in conjunction with a a diode transistor or resonator , uh two more resistors and a capacitor and the battery works in conjunction with a resistor and a capacitor . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Uh basically what happens is you'll press a number or give a voice command and this creates a a connection within the the remote that allows the chip the chip then senses this connection and produces a signal in a Morse code format . 
UNKNOWN This signal's sent to the transistor which amplifies it and then sends it on to the light emitting diode and uh which is then trai changed into a infrared light which is sent to the T_V_ and sort of seen by the T_V_ and which uh changes the channels . 
CONFUSION Um . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN Uh cool . 
UNKNOWN Uh so as for how we should end up uh using this in our remote uh t couple of main questions are the buttons . 
UNKNOWN Uh y the fewer buttons you have , I guess the fewer internal connections and internal codes you're gonna need . 
UNKNOWN Um however uh to n not have buttons or to use a voice commands instead of buttons might make these connections more difficult and uh raise the production cost . 
UNKNOWN That's something we should think about . 
UNKNOWN Also we have to work within the company constraints , and the company has informed me via emailthat uh they're experts at pushbuttons and that seems to be the most uh cost-effective way of producing it . 
UNKNOWN Um also with battery connections the company has some limits on the batteries we can use , so I was thinking perhaps a combination of solar cells with a back-up basic battery and somehow between the combination of that two we might be able to come up with something that uh will last the the lifetime or the five to ten years and we could still keep that original idea . 
UNKNOWN Um we also need to look at the chips , uh v custom-designed versus off the shelf , and the custom-designed will give us much more flexibility and enable us to incorporate the voice function that we all uh seem to have agreed upon . 
UNKNOWN Um , however that's gonna cost more , but uh the off the shelf is gonna be uh cheaper and it's gonna be allow us to produce it quicker and get out there faster , but it's going to be less flexible with the features , especially things like uh voice activation , which haven't really been used much on remotes , so there's not really chips out there that would be easy to uh to convert , so if we were uh definitely gonna go with the the voice option we'd probably have to design um our own chip . 
UNKNOWN And that pretty much sums it up . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so how um sorry , can you uh just put that one back up again , please ? 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Oh yep , sorry . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Uh d d d okay , I mean uh inevitably a b a custom design chip is gonna be more expensive . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Do we do we know uh by how much ? 
UNKNOWN Um I don't actually have any price information , no . 
UNKNOWN And and do we know how long it'll take to uh develop a a custom chip . 
UNKNOWN Um it a lot longer than an off the shelf chip . 
UNKNOWN Oh w yeah , we did the the problem is the the the voice technology is not really highly developed , it's sort of still still in an ex experimental form , uh so it would uh it's hard to predict the time . 
UNKNOWN Right , okay . 
UNKNOWN Right , I think we need to make a a decision here . 
UNKNOWN Uh given that the company wants this on the market quickly and cheaply , that would appear to uh effectively constrain us to an existing chip and thus therefore conventional button technology . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Um uh now before we go round everybody else , does anybody um h have any have anyti ha anything to say about that ? 
UNKNOWN I I just have a question about that . 
UNKNOWN Um does it make a difference if there are just a few commands , for example if you um can pre-programme in like numbers one through ten and pre-programme say , you know , nine channels and then just use the voice recognition to say channel one and then you've programmed in say B_B_C_ four as your channel one , as your favourite , it's like to have a certain number of favourites um and that w Okay . 
UNKNOWN W just to to incorporate the voice activation in it is is sorta the trick . 
UNKNOWN Once you've got the whole voice chip in there , then it's pretty much the the world the the sky is your limit , but to actually the the big step is to actually get the voice activation chips in there and working . 
UNKNOWN Then it doesn't matter . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Cause uh I must say I find it slightly surprising given that , you know , mobile phones incorporate voice activated dialling . 
UNKNOWN So uh um I mean I d d for slightly different well no , I mean , it's if you you speak somebody's name and it'll dial the number for you , so uh bu I mean the this this information is from is this is the internal company information , is it ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh bits of it , yeah . 
UNKNOWN So uh Yeah , mm true , again but if it's without any without any uh p price informations that's uh difficult to uh uh decide . 
UNKNOWN Of course mobile phones do tend to be more expensive , you know , hundred and fifty pounds or something . 
UNKNOWN Yes , as well . 
UNKNOWN As opposed to the twenty Euros , twenty five Euros . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Also lots of mobile phones have got a lot of technology in them , not just that , so . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's that's right . 
UNKNOWN It's like it's it's you can't 'cause mobile phones are expensive , you can't say it's the voice recognition bit that is . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But we don't know . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN I mean uh I su i I mean if given that the um the technology is not well developed and and given that it's it's never been done before , um th th the double risk , uh perhaps we ought to uh stick to uh to buttons , since the last thing we want to do is present a product that doesn't work . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Thoughts ? 
UNKNOWN Well , another thought I oh , sorry , go ahead . 
UNKNOWN Would Oh I was just gonna say mayb maybe it sh like um maybe we can like cut corners somewhere else to bring in over cost . 
UNKNOWN I mean do w do we think that the voice technology is fundamental to the project ? 
UNKNOWN Uh it's fundament well I mean I guess it it's something we've discussed uh since the the sort of the beginning , so I th I think in in our in our minds it's it's fundamental , but I don't know that the uh the upper echelons of the company would necessarily agree with that , so I think you have to Hm . 
UNKNOWN I mean I think we Mm . 
UNKNOWN Oh yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Well , I kinda think if we're gonna have the voice recognition for part of it , then maybe we should have it for the whole thing . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I I I I I think that's uh Yeah , yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN And we've been talking about it the whole time . 
UNKNOWN Mm , mm . 
UNKNOWN Anyway , I'm I'm incli kinda inclined to say that we should just go for it . 
UNKNOWN Mm , right , okay . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Uh yeah , it's the second most important aspect to users that the device should be technologically innovative . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN From uh my presentationshow , so . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , it should be Right , okay , so . 
UNKNOWN Uh technologically innovative . 
UNKNOWN No , that sounds good . 
UNKNOWN Fine . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN I it will have voice recognition um uh if if that means uh if that means we can't afford buttons but I mean b b second question , do we need the five buttons for channel change , up down , volume up down and on off , just as a a backup or just so that people can uh j j just sit there pressing buttons ? 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Cool . 
UNKNOWN Um Yeah , I I would say we do , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think so . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Sorry , d did you want to say anything ? 
UNKNOWN Uh nope , that was it , that was it . 
UNKNOWN No ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Shall we move rapidly on to uh Kendra ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Uh um ra rapidly move the cable over . 
UNKNOWN Let's see . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Oh good . 
SURPRISE Oh .
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN Is it gonna work ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , it's thinking about it . 
UNKNOWN Mm yeah , it'll get there . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so I did some research on the internet and um what you know , the interf user interface are just aspects that are seen by users , um commands and mechanisms for the operation , and there're just kind of a variety of choices . 
UNKNOWN Um findings , so a lot of times they tend to look cluttered and these were just a couple examples of um different kinds that are a little bit more unusual . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN There're some special ones available , like this one right here , which is marketed towards children , um different designs, and one of the things that n we need to watch out for is a V_ in volume because people some Bring a little picture of what I thought ours could look like . 
UNKNOWN Mm , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh-huh . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
UNKNOWN So just kind of minimise the clutter , avoid too many buttons and also um one of the things that people have used is a slidebutton , like you have on a mouse , that possibly we could use that on the sides for volume , for example , have the slidebutton on the side , and then you can pre-programme the channels , the voice recognition and then the voice response sample locator . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Mm yeah . 
UNKNOWN Sorry y y yeah , if I can interrupt you . 
UNKNOWN Well d p 'kay , do you wanna say anything about um slidecontrols ? 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN I mean I think the reason everybody uses pushbuttons is that they're they're si simple , cheap and reliable . 
UNKNOWN Uh Uh I think they're they're about the same cost really . 
UNKNOWN I I mean , I think it's just sort of the the there's a lot of slidebuttons out there . 
UNKNOWN I think it's pretty much the same sort of connection . 
UNKNOWN Okay , fair enough , fine . 
UNKNOWN Mm yeah . 
UNKNOWN Just because I n for example if I'm using a mouse I like to be able to slideit up and down so I thought it might be good for volume to just be able to kind of roll it and then have the up and down and then the this is my great little drawing. 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Good , good . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So three three there's three buttons on a slider . 
UNKNOWN Three buttons , channel up channel up down and Uh-huh . 
UNKNOWN Y yes , yes . 
UNKNOWN Well , if you g if you if you got a channel up down , we can have a slider in that as well . 
UNKNOWN Because if it if you no if you notice on the thing it it kind of like has got kind of if you you know it s kind of like sticks , if you know what I mean , up like one unit , if you see what I mean . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN So it kinda goes up one , then y like you can keep rolling it up , but it's like like like like a cog or something . 
UNKNOWN So you kinda take it up one at a time . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN The only advantage I was thinking of to having the buttons , like the buttons on one side for the channel , and then the slider is that if you're just holding in your hand , and you pick it up , it's easy to n s know , okay , this is just the volume and this is the channel . 
UNKNOWN D Oh . 
UNKNOWN Um Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN This one on the one side and one yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh you could you could as l as like a mouse you could Yeah , like the shape of it almost like a mouse , with a Dep I dunno if it depending on the final shape of it , 'cause you could have like , I dunno , it looks like you can c control the volume with your thumb , and then you could control the buttons with your fingers . 
UNKNOWN Ye yeah , 'cause I've definitely picked up remotes and like meant to change the channel and turn the volume , or vice versa , so it'd be kinda good to have them be feel completely different . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN You'd know what you were fiddling with . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , or yeah uh th th the I mean thi this is what the we have to come up with is the the actual shape that people can ins instantly pick it up and and know know uh know what it's going to do . 
UNKNOWN That was Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so we we're looking at sliders for both a uh volume and channel change of one sort . 
UNKNOWN Um well I was thinking kind of just for the volume , but what what do you guys think ? 
UNKNOWN Just for the volume , uh . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN We could Yeah , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , 'cause if yeah , in that kinda position the fingers would be better for pressing and the that for rolling , just the way it would Mm yeah , yeah , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Fingers , yeah . 
UNKNOWN I mean it's it's It yeah , I mean it it it seems to me that uh it uh it al also has the advantage that it it the two are clearly different , um that there's no no possibility of uh confusing the two . 
UNKNOWN B Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Oh yeah , yeah . 
UNKNOWN So okay . 
UNKNOWN I'm just gonna pass this along . 
UNKNOWN Right so uh that's sorry is that that all you want to say at the mo okay , fine . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Mm right . 
UNKNOWN Here we go . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Uh yeah , this is my reporton trend watching . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN The data's come off internet uh from executive summary for us on the top three things wanted by the consumer . 
UNKNOWN And we got reports from Paris , Milan on new fashions . 
UNKNOWN And uh the most important aspect is the l the look it has to look fancy , look and feel uh instead of the current functional look and feel . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN This is a st well I was gonna say yeah twice as important as the second aspect , which is the technologically innov innovative um side of it . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN So uh and the third being easy to use is probably a given , we have to try and incorporate , so uh Uh exactly , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well I I mean I th I think that what we're suggesting ought to address all three of those . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN I s that out of sequence ? 
UNKNOWN Uh yeah , sorry . 
UNKNOWN Uh yeah , and uh from the fashion watchers from Milan and Paris have said fruit and vegetables are an important theme for clothes and furniture and shoes , et cetera . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN Uh sorry , clothes , shoes and furniture and uh a spongy material to be used on the on the outside . 
UNKNOWN Uh-huh . 
UNKNOWN Mm I hadn't thought of that , that's different , certainly . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But uh I was gonna say um yeah , fruit and vegetables , uh important to this year um important to furniture , I'm just gonna say uh f like it's in if if fashion if we're going for the it looks fancy , then fashion is obviously the line we gotta be going through . 
UNKNOWN What ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN But fashions do don't last very long . 
UNKNOWN Well that can kinda tie into our changing uh face things , like we could have the fruit and vegetable theme this year and uh whatever happens next year , we can have the face plates , yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , we can have a sp like a spongy skin on it and then we can just whip that off and A kind of yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah . 
CONFUSION Uh . 
UNKNOWN Yeah like the kind you get on like hand weights . 
UNKNOWN You know , that kind of spongy yeah . 
UNKNOWN Mm , yeah , that weird I dunno what that is , but yeah . 
CONFUSION Uh . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Also means you can drop it without damaging it . 
UNKNOWN Oh Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh , yeah , it's good as well . 
UNKNOWN That's c cool . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's true . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um you have we could if we could save depending on the cost of the product itself , you know , could we have uh a cheaper b cheaper power source and then just have it annually renewed ? 
UNKNOWN Instead of having a ten year guarantee ? 
UNKNOWN With interchangeable covers , could just buy a new one every year , a new one when new fashions come out . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN I I mean it its uh I that's an interesting idea , it's like the old Swatch watch where uh um on only batteries ever got changed in those , 'cause people just bought a new one when it went out of fashion , but it's just never been seen as a a fashion item before . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um that's yes if if if they're made in sufficient quantity W I mean we we can uh uh b but I mean my feeling is that current power sources are such that for relatively little cost you can make it last , you know , a long time . 
UNKNOWN Wh What if we included the batteries in the cover ? 
UNKNOWN I I think it's easier sometimes to have them buy changeable covers for it than to buy a whole new one , because you don't feel like you're investing in a whole new product . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um but if we also make it cheap enough that people either change the cover every year or even buy a new one every year then it it's it's even better . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Oh yeah . 
UNKNOWN So um like Yeah , so can I see that thing ? 
UNKNOWN I like that . 
UNKNOWN That all c also kind of encourages 'em to buy new covers and yeah . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN S Yeah , yeah , I n I know the only p I mean the the the the immediate thing that comes to mind with that is that it it it y you've then got the connection and you've immediately got a sort of unreliability , whereas the advantage of having it plumbed in is that that the whole thing is all , you know , completely soldered together and it it it you know , total reliability , but I mean I d I I uh I know what you're saying and uh understand where you're coming from . 
UNKNOWN Just this as examples . 
UNKNOWN So f Yeah , I guess that's true . 
UNKNOWN Uh yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Or well , but like uh like more than just the battery , like a complete different like you've only got like , you know like th uh this bit's the bit you keep , and this is the expensive bit , this is like the chip and this is the microphone . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN And then this is the power source and the bit everyone sees . 
UNKNOWN And then Yeah , you probably are right . 
UNKNOWN I th I s I think if we're gonna go down that route , then we're talking about uh even if it costs slightly more than that , um just building the whole thing in one , then having getting cheaper production costs um and , you know giving people the option of buying a new uh a a complete new thing , the advantage of a replaceable cover is that even if they don't it doesn't have a cover on at all , it will still work um totally . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's true . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Um then if , you know , if people lose the cover , I mean they they might be well inclined to go out and spend however many Euros on a on a new one um rather than a a complete new re remote . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well that that's just it with the covers , you're sort of tricking 'em into continuing to spend their money on our products without making 'em feel like they're being ripped off having to buy a new product . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I mean it is it's up to it's up to Yeah , it's it's up to our marketing people to to ma to ma turn it into a a fashion item . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , just another five Euro to get Right . 
UNKNOWN So , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Mm , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um and , you know , as as external fashions change , then we get new new covers on the market and , you know , readily available . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And um that's that's right , yeah , yeah . 
UNKNOWN And that's the sort of thing , once you get the mould set , you can just whip out different colours , different pictures very very quickly . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , like they have for mobile phones that are just fruits and animal prints and colours . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah , exactly , exactly . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , okay . 
UNKNOWN So uh i so uh okay . 
UNKNOWN Um right , sorry . 
UNKNOWN Um we hadn't finished your It's the sort of thing that we want people to have prominent dis displayed on their um coffee table to say this says something about me . 
UNKNOWN Um oh , don't worry it's all said , I was just gonna say uh yeah , are we gonna make this as part of like like uh a part of the f like it it the fashions apply to furniture , so are we gonna make this part of the furniture ? 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um this is fashionable . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN This is fashionable with Oh yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I , you know , I'm I'm I'm with it , I'm up to date . 
UNKNOWN And you know , th the the design that I've got , and and it could be a a home-made design , um you know this says this is not just a a television remote control , this is , you know , a fashion accessory . 
UNKNOWN Um , so I mean the the the basic shape i is is what we uh I mean given that we've got you know one one on off button presumably , two buttons for uh channel change and one slider and basically nothing else , um w we need to decide on the just the basic shape of the thing . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN And , know whether we go down the fruit and veg route , and I don't suggest we make it look like a banana , but um know sort of the the organic , you know , curved look , you know , t to deliberately get away from the uh um uh you know , the the the the square look of most um current uh remotes and , you know , whether whether the you know , the the fixed part of it is the corporate yellow . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Um mm or uh 'cause there's certainly you know , the the corporate logo needs to be prominently uh displayed so that people s th looked at it and say right , that's a Real Reaction remote control , I want one of those . 
UNKNOWN I dunno that we should make the whole thing yellow I kinda thought with a you'd have like a yellow circle with the R_R_ in it somewhere on it , but I'd yellow seems a bit of a strong colour to make the ent like the thing no , but I mean just like white or grey or black or some sort of blah colour . 
UNKNOWN Yeah uh the the uh or or b Yeah , I'd I'd um yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , like an . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh no I d I I agree , I mean we're we're we're simply it's simply required to incorporate the the the the corporate logo prominently um . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN And make that a fashion symbol as well . 
UNKNOWN Well n Well I was sort of mm kinda picturing like maybe um a shape that's almost like a mouse . 
UNKNOWN Well , th this is this is the whole point , yes , you know , I'm I've got a a Real Reaction uh remote control to go with my Real Reaction coffee maker or or whatever . 
UNKNOWN And uh then people , you know , people demand more Real Reaction stuff . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So that , you know , when they hold it it's because a mouse is pretty comfortable to hold in your hand um maybe we could make it a slightly different shape so they could hold on to it , but that way they can have the volume on the side and then the channel buttons and have the power , wherever , somewhere . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I mean that was just an idea that I had . 
UNKNOWN I mean I've uh yeah . 
UNKNOWN Oh no that well there's the sim my my idea was something a b probably you know a bit fatter than this but sort of tha that sorta shape so that you can just sort of ho hold it . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , maybe . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , you'd want it narrower than a mouse though 'cause it a mouse you're kinda just resting on it , you want something you can definitely grip . 
UNKNOWN Kind of a c Yeah . 
UNKNOWN W it I mean well it's sort of it's it's sort of uh a a mouse , but held , you know , so it's you sorta hold it in your hand like that , i with , you know , and fiddling with the buttons . 
UNKNOWN So maybe it'd be Yeah , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Sort of a combination . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , and fiddle around with it and press it . 
UNKNOWN Yeah so yeah , kind of maybe maybe a little wider than this , 'cause this is pretty comfortable to hold , and then if you had Yeah , then wider up here . 
UNKNOWN Maybe almost like a hairbrush , like you could get the about the width of that end of the pen and then it widens up top and you can fiddle an yeah . 
UNKNOWN And then it would have a l uh wider thing to uh have the light , the infrared light at the T_V_ and just kinda change channels and adjust the volume and the power could be wherever , up up the top or something . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , cool . 
UNKNOWN What do you guys think about that ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that sounds Um I'm just I'm suddenly realising that yeah we're discussing how much how good it's gonna be to change channels t we still can just tell it to . 
UNKNOWN Okay , yeah , yeah . 
UNKNOWN I mean are we are we starting to get away from the the voice functionality of it ? 
UNKNOWN Oh yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It's a very good point . 
UNKNOWN It is a very good point . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think we d I think we decided that w we're actually going down both routes . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN That um the we n we need the the manual controls and that they should be of that form , but that uh yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But do you know , this shape also kind of les lend itself to to voice 'cause if you're you're holding it and you're fiddling , but you can also bring it up like that and it's microphone-esque , yeah , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Then you just bring it up to your mouth and just speak to it , yeah , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , and just say Yeah , I suppose I sup So I guess we could have a menu button as well . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , maybe we cou like w like we're leaving out the buttons for the the f less frequently used stuff , but maybe we could incorporate that into the voice . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN I th I th honest uh my personal view is that if it's not there , people wouldn't use it anyway um . 
UNKNOWN Mm I suppose , but t there is the off chance that , you know , th the brightness is wrong on your T_V_ or the contrast needs changing . 
UNKNOWN It's cer it's certainly possible I mean , but they we we're going beyond w w given the state of the technology we want something that we kno we know will will work um . 
UNKNOWN Bu Mm . 
UNKNOWN Hmm yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well you can still i incorporate the voice with with less buttons . 
UNKNOWN I mean uh if the power button was also somehow like a menu button you could press that and or do voice commands , and either volume thing could also be to scroll through other options like y and you could scroll through brightness and and sc and then you can you can minimise the buttons and still have those , you know , brightness and tint and stuff . 
UNKNOWN Uh Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's a good idea . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN If we we're I mean I'm getting a clear message that we think that we should have those facilities available . 
UNKNOWN Yeah Yeah . 
UNKNOWN We could have the channels and the power and then a menu button and then the volume . 
UNKNOWN So have four buttons and the volume instead of three buttons and the volume . 
UNKNOWN Uh uh uh Okay , if we if we're going down that route , then we need some sort of display . 
UNKNOWN Do we need some sort of display ? 
UNKNOWN But the television would be the display that things like that usually c pop up on a televi like you hit menu and menu will come up on television and have like tint brightness , and you'd use the scroll , scroll through it yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's on the T_V_ , yeah . 
UNKNOWN We actually use the television , okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , and then y Yeah , press that is t yeah , that might work . 
UNKNOWN Okay , okay , okay . 
UNKNOWN Well I mean on a onto like a mouse , the ru the scrolling button , is actually a button as well , you could press it , you could press that and have it as a menu button . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah , that's true . 
UNKNOWN I never understood how that worked though , but yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , it's like um yeah , it's like the mouse where you just kinda click it . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , mm . 
UNKNOWN You just press it . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , and you could just click that to so if you had like the menu then you could scroll through and then click it to select . 
UNKNOWN Mm , oka yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh yeah . 
UNKNOWN You know what I mean ? 
UNKNOWN Mm yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay , we got five minutes to go in this meeting , so um I d I think we've actually very conveniently just uh come to uh a good point to s to sum up um . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Cool . 
UNKNOWN So um b b Kate and Kendra now go away and uh pa play play with a bit of Plasticine or play-dough , whatever it is on the other side of the Atlantic . 
UNKNOWN Play with play-dough . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um and actually put what we've discussed into something uh I was gonna say concrete , but that's a slightly inappropriate word um to something that we can we can see and um Andrew n can go away and th th think about how we can uh actually market this as a concept and not j not just a uh um a a simple remote control . 
UNKNOWN Uh can I just get some things clear just for my sake . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , certainly , of course . 
UNKNOWN Our energy source is gonna be long term . 
UNKNOWN I think I think we decided that we're gonna for for simplicity of , you know , manufacturing and uh maintenance that we will go for a a long term battery source um , I you know , on the basis that um that , you know , if we're going for making it a fashion statement , then uh people are more likely to change it anyway uh before i it runs out and um make an assumption that we we can aim for a battery that will last most people for uh we'll say at least five five ten years and that we'll w we will guarantee it for for five years um . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Cool . 
UNKNOWN Uh And we're having a custom chip ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN We're having a a custom chip , but given the the we've cut the functions down , um that will hopefully not be too problematic , but given that um technol technological innovation is important , then we need to , I'll say it again , technologically innovate . 
UNKNOWN Um and uh we we , know , we must resist any efforts to uh to try and water that down um . 
UNKNOWN And interchangeable case ? 
UNKNOWN I i interchangeable case seems to be um um important to the concept . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Um it it should be cheap , you know , if if we avoid any , you know , electrical connections . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And uh i you know , i if we can come up with some way of of allowing people to actually personalise it uh to whatever they want , then uh I mean uh uh this is totally new . 
UNKNOWN Mm , mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN We d we don't know whether that to what extent people do it or not , but if they've at least got a a good selection of um covers that they can use anyway , and uh and if if we can keep them , you know , rolling , then uh you know , so they can get them in the supermarket when they go down to um a any of the famous supermarkets , I won't mention any mention any names , um it's uh it's good for the supermarket and it's good for us and it hopefully makes them feel better . 
UNKNOWN And uh are we gonna have it il being illuminated from inside onto the buttons or Cool . 
UNKNOWN Um the that I mean that's no , because we've got so few buttons that it that actually makes that redundant . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I think so too . 
UNKNOWN Mm , does actually , yeah , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , and especially for making them so like different and Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Mm different to feel , yeah , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah . 
UNKNOWN And the you know , that that solves one of the problems of b of battery life , 'cause that would well that would clobber the battery life , so no , I mean given the nature of the buttons we're having , it's actually uh uh unnecessary I think . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yep , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Are we having it that it's any angle , or is it just As wide as possible . 
UNKNOWN As uh as wide cer certainly wider angle than than current , so that if you're holding it , you know , anyway like you're likely to and uh it's uh you know , i i it will work most of the time um . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Like this or like this . 
UNKNOWN Mm yeah . 
UNKNOWN Not like my my mum who points it at the ceiling and wonders why the th th the television doesn't work . 
UNKNOWN Um yeah , I mean I d I th I sorta envisaged that if if this was the the thing , then sort of the the whole of the top would be the uh the infrared uh . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , kinda like this whole So you could use like this and it would go . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , mm . 
UNKNOWN Um so Yeah , 'cause I mean the r reality is people are they're gonna be looking at the television whilst they're using it , the chances are , so if if they're holding it anyway , the they're reasonably likely to be holding it to use it , then uh then that that's the sort of coverage that we want . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um okay , d we're all clear where we go from here . 
UNKNOWN Yep , sounds good . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so thank you very much indeed and I'll s see you all again in thirty minutes . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN Right well . 
UNKNOWN Welcome to the what should be the last of these meetings and uh it looks like we've uh done a good job here and uh we'll just go through the the final uh the final details . 
UNKNOWN Um okay , oh the um th the the minutesof the last meeting uh I think we'll take those as read , um Okay the um th the the next uh thing we we we'll have a look at the uh th have a look at the prototypes and uh look at the uh evaluation criteria and finance and then uh uh just tidy up with production and um and then we can close . 
UNKNOWN Um So f if if you'd like to uh present your your proposals . 
UNKNOWN Uh okay we basically have the same kinda lay-out here it's just um you hold it like this and it gets kinda moulded to the to the shape of your hand , basically . 
UNKNOWN Um on the left we've got the scroll for the volume , on the right we have buttons for the channels up and down and that kinda so you can hold it and scroll , or you can hold it and and push . 
UNKNOWN Uh this is the power key , um it's kinda like the biggest so you know how to turn on . 
UNKNOWN Uh-huh . 
UNKNOWN Uh that's the little menu key . 
UNKNOWN This is the infra-red section so you g it'll be sending rays and if you're you know pointing it like that it can send it , or if you hold it up like that it'll send it . 
UNKNOWN Yep , yeah , good , good . 
UNKNOWN Uh we got a microphone there which for all the voice commands so you can you know talk to it like that and it'll still understand . 
UNKNOWN Uh-huh . 
UNKNOWN Yep , right . 
UNKNOWN Um the logo is down down there um and has the cover on it and you can see like it just kinda goes the red bit's the cover and it kinda goes over everything and then there's holes for the buttons to come through . 
UNKNOWN Uh-huh . 
UNKNOWN S And so we figured it would be kind of you know a light weight plastic , just kind of a light non-descript grey so that people'll wanna buy the covers and then the covers will be that sort of rubbery material like they make iPod covers , so they kinda just stretch over . 
UNKNOWN Yep , yep , mm-hmm . 
CONFUSION Um . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Uh-huh . 
UNKNOWN Yep yep . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN showing me age , I don't know what i c iPod covers are like . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , well I I didn't know that but yeah they're kind of it's just kind of a rubbery and that way you know spongy like is something that people wanted and it just sort of stretches over and that way I think probably helps protect it a little bit too as well and just kinda stretch it over and it'll just stay on and then the buttons come through and so and then the each one of 'em on the very end will have the logo with the yellow circle and the R_R_ . 
UNKNOWN Yeah yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh-huh . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay , yep , right . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN But it's also e e easier to put on versus like mobile covers you actually have to screw them on and stuff and you kinda sometimes have to get someone to do that for you . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN This is very much you should be able to stretch it over yourself and it'll be fine . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN Okay , good yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yep , right . 
UNKNOWN Li that'll be the covers as well , yeah yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah . 
UNKNOWN I mean tha it's it's a detailed point , I just wondered I mean h how will people put these down I wonder ? 
UNKNOWN Like that . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Okay for some strange re reason I had it in my mind that they'd put them down vertically but uh uh Yeah , uh no because particularly if they've dif if they're gonna have it as a you know as a fashion item uh I mean it it's uh it it's just I mean it's just a minor detailed point , but um as you say you can just make the base a little bit bigger and uh Yeah and uh it just needs another uh another logo somewhere is is is is all it gives gives people the option and if if say if they've got them um because actually have several upon the uh Yeah , well . 
UNKNOWN Yeah it could stand , yeah . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN Well we could broaden the broaden it out a bit so it would stand like that . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , standing . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , we could just widen it out uh Mm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Could have one for your stereo , one for your D_V_ player . 
UNKNOWN Mm , yeah , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Have to if we just lengthen it I guess so it comes down to the base of the hand and then flatten it out and could sit there . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , just kind of Or just make it little . 
UNKNOWN Yeah but that that's uh but uh no the the the overall uh the overall concept is uh yeah yeah , no no , I mean that's these uh Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , mm . 
UNKNOWN Somewhere like that so it just sort of Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN We might have to lengthen it so it kinda your hand still holds it and have it there , yeah , yeah , yeah like that , like that . 
UNKNOWN Yeah I kinda had a a kinda a natural kind of a idea where it's like more of a kind of like a kinda maybe slightly like thinner , yeah , kinda like that kinda like a flower or a plant for the more natural kinda Uh yeah , just click there . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Bu . 
UNKNOWN But uh yeah but no th but the yeah the the the Yeah , yeah , yeah , I mean it it's uh wouldn't wouldn't do that , indeed yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN fall over . 
UNKNOWN The final product would actually stand up , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But th th but th yeah th b the these were all minor minor uh minor details , I think the uh the basic concept i i is is absolutely bang on and the i it certainly meets our criteria of being uh of you know looking different . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN . 
UNKNOWN 'S a little longer . 
UNKNOWN Wee Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um , so good that's that that's excellent . 
UNKNOWN Um right let us um What's on the next one ? 
UNKNOWN Oh right yes , let's have a look at the um f finance . 
UNKNOWN Um , now we're given a a clear design brief , uh if I get the uh spreadsheetup . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN . 
UNKNOWN Uh the the maximise button . 
UNKNOWN Oh right . 
UNKNOWN Ah . 
UNKNOWN Good , this is why we need to make these things simple so that the uh the the the boss can understand . 
UNKNOWN Now I've um this is the company's uh uh costing for for various uh uh aspects of design and I I I've treated some of these slightly uh liberally given the constraints placed on us , um I wouldn't know for in for instance if if they require us to have it in the corporate colours , then that is not a special colour , that's a that's a standard colour . 
UNKNOWN Uh , so we're just simply on batteries , the the one th the one decision I've had to make is that um we're we will have to find a s a regular standard chip to to do this with and I I um I'm I'm I'm certain that they they are around so , um that I don't think is a a serious problem . 
UNKNOWN The uh the the voice sensor is is expensive but we we made a a basic decision that that was absolutely fundamental to the to the design so that that has to stay . 
UNKNOWN Um then again the the the the shape of the case means that it's it's expensive to uh um l to make 'cause of the the th the double curves but on the other hand because of our overall fashion concept um we we should exceed the the sales targets . 
UNKNOWN Um it's simply made of plastic so th that's uh that's no problem and uh um just because the whole the colour of the the whole thing that's uh uh there's some cost there . 
UNKNOWN Um and uh we haven't actually got a scroll wheel we we we got push buttons and and a simple uh um slider so um and the and the the buttons are uh uh well I do don't know that they're special colour . 
UNKNOWN Anyway the the costings uh come in at exactly on target at twelve point five uh but I thi I think we have a a very strong case to argue that uh what what we've got is is so in innovative and uh and different that um any any slight compromise we have to make on on cost is is offset by the uh you know the uh you know the the the the concept of it being a a fashion accessory and and having the the interchangeable covers so uh um you know the if if if the management expect us to be techno again fail again technologically innovative um that they they have to accept that we we can't operate absolutely within uh the constraints that they give , so uh we we we present this as the uh the company's uh the the company's way forward and uh uh I I think we can argue that we we have uh come in on on budget . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Okay , uh . 
UNKNOWN So um . 
UNKNOWN Does anybody want to uh uh Andrew do you want what do you want to say about um the uh yeah the evaluation where where you know well where where we're where where we're at ? 
UNKNOWN Evaluation . 
UNKNOWN The the product or the project ? 
UNKNOWN The the the well the I meant the product . 
UNKNOWN Um , well well my presentationjust now ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Sure , uh can I get the Cheers . 
UNKNOWN Oh sorry yeah um , mm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN More loud clicks in the microphone . 
UNKNOWN There we go , oh . 
UNKNOWN Method of evaluation testing the product was to just if it met all the criteria all the conditions that we set out to set out to solve , from the point of view of the the consumer and the management . 
UNKNOWN So what I've been asked to do is , on the whiteboard um gauge our team response to these questions . 
UNKNOWN So , on a scale of one to seven , one being true and seven being being false . 
UNKNOWN Seven being a nice round number to work to . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And then at the end just take an average Yes . 
UNKNOWN Tr On for true and seven for flase . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN So uh . 
UNKNOWN So , look at these questions . 
UNKNOWN Is the device f flashy and fashionable ? 
UNKNOWN Well I think most definitely . 
UNKNOWN Yeah I'd say definitely a one yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think it is yeah . 
UNKNOWN So uh and also uh technologically innovative ? 
UNKNOWN Yes the voice technology indeed . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , defi yeah , yeah Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Easy to use ? 
UNKNOWN I don't see we could've made it any easier . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh suitable for the consumer ? 
UNKNOWN That was um Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Totally . 
UNKNOWN Yeah definitely . 
UNKNOWN Yeah I think it made we met all of the consumer wants . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh is it complicated ? 
NEGATION No . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN Doing pretty well so far aren't we ? 
UNKNOWN Uh functional ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah definitely . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Where are we ? 
UNKNOWN found easily . 
UNKNOWN We've b built in the the speech , where are you , function . 
UNKNOWN yeah I mean that's that's Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh-huh . 
UNKNOWN Does it take long to learn to use ? 
UNKNOWN Shouldn't . 
UNKNOWN No , not at all . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN And uh , what else ? 
UNKNOWN The R_S_I_ compares to the current standards , well . 
UNKNOWN Less buttons so it must be . 
UNKNOWN Uh Yeah it is sorta the the handle more ergonomically correct as well . 
UNKNOWN We we uh yeah it was our it was a we made an actual effort to Um will device appeal to all age groups ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So yeah , um um . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think it will because I mean uh old older people who can't manage the buttons anyway will actually probably like the like like the voice bit so And it's it's it's well I don't think we're actually charging a particular premium anyway , in the end , so Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN I think so . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , uh that's a good call , yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Well we had the we had the data saying that old people will be less likely to pay extra money but the funct the increased functionality , the e ease of use of the device might make up for that . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN I I I think it will tend to appeal more to younger aged groups just 'cause we have gone with the fashion focus and the younger people tend to would be more conscious of that aspect of it , but um I think it should still appeal on a certain level to everybody , yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It will appeal f for dif for different reasons but it's it's uh yeah yeah so I I yeah I Yeah , so I think we can reasonably say it's another another one , why not ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah I think just the simplicity of it and not having to learn to programme and not having you know a million buttons . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Uh can you just click the my mouse to move onto next page? 
UNKNOWN Uh , yeah and what h did we make the management's Um . 
UNKNOWN in in in in my interpretation of management's instructions uh is that yes it it meets the requirement is t it's television only , it's it's simple to use , um it's it's it's within budget , um I it's uh yes an an any minor points we we we argue . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Under the cost . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN So uh I I think we've done an amazing job in uh coming up with what Need a need a calculator for that . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Well done us . 
UNKNOWN So uh one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven . 
UNKNOWN Eleven divided by eleven's one so equals average of one . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , . 
UNKNOWN And that roughly concludes my evaluation of the of the product . 
CONFIRMATION Excellent . 
UNKNOWN Okay , nick the cable back then . 
UNKNOWN I mixed up the colours a little bit . 
UNKNOWN Oh no that's Uh . 
UNKNOWN I think I all wrong . 
UNKNOWN Ooh . 
UNKNOWN Right do um either of you want to uh say anything ? 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Before I uh No . 
UNKNOWN Ps I don't think so , I mean I think we worked well together and looked really at what the consumers wanted and what we were trying to make and you know , seemed to discuss things pretty well and come to group consensus and Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Well that's right , I mean th this this slidehere I mean the satisfaction with uh room for creativity , I mean I think we've allowed ourselves uh as much creativity as the uh the the the product uh allows . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , definitely . 
UNKNOWN Um I won't comment on leadership , uh teamwork I think we've uh I think everybody's uh worked pretty well together . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um we've just about coped with the whiteboard and digital pens , uh I think the results speak for itself and new ideas found , um , again gi no given relatively everyday product , I think we've v very uh very effectively come up with a a new uh uh a new approach . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN Um are the costs within budget ? 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN Is the project evaluated ? 
UNKNOWN We're we're all happy that it it meets all the criteria , um Thank you very much indeed , I think that I think that's uh I think we can go f for an early bath . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN Cool , thank you , Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So I call the meeting closed . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Not sure how far ahead of schedule we were there . 
UNKNOWN Is this okay ? 
UNKNOWN Uh yeah . 
UNKNOWN Fine now . 
UNKNOWN Oh , it's not liking us , it went that-a-way . 
UNKNOWN Computer adjusting . 
SURPRISE Oh .
CONFUSION Uh . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN You ready back there ? 
UNKNOWN Uh okay . 
UNKNOWN Welcome everyone . 
UNKNOWN Um this is the kick-off meeting for the day . 
UNKNOWN Um we're the new group uh to create a new remote control for Real Reaction . 
UNKNOWN As you can see our agendais to open up the meeting , um become acquainted with each other , um have a little training on tools , uh create a plan , discuss things and and we only have twenty minut twenty five minutes total . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN The new remote control is to be original , trendy and user-friendly . 
UNKNOWN That , Steph , is your part , is the user-friendliness . 
UNKNOWN The originality um is gonna take all of us . 
UNKNOWN Um the trendiness we'll probably go look at for some marketing research information from you , Sarah . 
UNKNOWN Um and we'll get on with it . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so we'll have a functional design individual work um with meeting and then conceptual design t and then detailed design . 
UNKNOWN Okay ? 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Everybody's supposed to try out the whiteboard . 
UNKNOWN Kate , why don't you try it first , if you can either bring your things with you , I guess And while you're doing that we'll try and figure out how to hook these things on as well , 'cause we're all gonna have to be able to walk around . 
UNKNOWN Uh yeah , if I can pick up with all these bits and pieces , hang on . 
UNKNOWN Uh right , so you want an animal and the characteristics of that animal . 
UNKNOWN Do you have to be able to recognise what animal it is ? 
UNKNOWN Uh I do not think so , I think it's just to try out the whiteboard . 
UNKNOWN Um Only animal I could thin I could draw. 
UNKNOWN Are we all gonna drawa cat ? 
UNKNOWN I know . 
UNKNOWN Ah . 
UNKNOWN Its a sort of bunny rabbit cat . 
UNKNOWN You can tell it's not a bunny rabbit by the ears . 
UNKNOWN Uh-huh . 
UNKNOWN Um I suppose it should have a mouth as well , sort of Right , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Great . 
UNKNOWN And the characteristics ? 
UNKNOWN Um the favourite characteristics of the cat um the whiskers I think , um because they're the easiest to draw. 
UNKNOWN Uh-huh . 
UNKNOWN In fact , I'll give it some more Oh , and the tail Yes . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Fantastic . 
UNKNOWN Since you're handy as well , why don't you do yours next , Steph . 
UNKNOWN I think it's to get us used to using the pen . 
UNKNOWN Um sure it's not to test our artistic It's a mouse . 
UNKNOWN Uh no . 
UNKNOWN A mouse-y ? 
UNKNOWN That's not a mouse-y , no . 
UNKNOWN No it's not a mouse . 
UNKNOWN It's a wombat . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN It's a ratty . 
UNKNOWN Argh . 
UNKNOWN A what ? 
UNKNOWN A ratty . 
UNKNOWN Rat . 
UNKNOWN Not a mouse , a rat . 
UNKNOWN A webbed foot . 
UNKNOWN Webbed f Oh right . 
UNKNOWN It's clothes . 
UNKNOWN That's it's clothes . 
UNKNOWN It's a ratty with a with a with a very long tail . 
UNKNOWN And your favourite characteristics of that animal . 
UNKNOWN I love whiskers . 
UNKNOWN Uh they're intelligent and they're cheeky and uh fantastic pets and very friendly . 
SURPRISE Oh .
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN And they sit on your shoulder and whisper the answers to your homework in your ear when you're doing your homework . 
UNKNOWN Kate ? 
CONFIRMATION Thanks . 
UNKNOWN Oh , a fish . 
UNKNOWN A shark ? 
UNKNOWN Gosh , why didn't I think of fish ? 
UNKNOWN That's even easier to drawthan cat . 
UNKNOWN Mm this is very representational fish . 
CONFIRMATION Oh , okay . 
UNKNOWN Fine . 
UNKNOWN Um I like them because they're sleek and they have a lot of freedom but they also do n uh swim in groups , so . 
UNKNOWN Favourite characteristics ? 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN So they have team elements . 
UNKNOWN Do you have a favourite one ? 
UNKNOWN I'm afraid I'm with Steph . 
UNKNOWN And I think your pen's running out of whatever . 
UNKNOWN But I'm afraid I take the coward's way out , and the cat's looking the other way . 
UNKNOWN He's hiding . 
UNKNOWN Um cats are sometimes very independent . 
UNKNOWN My parents had cats . 
UNKNOWN Uh and they can mm decide for themselves what is best . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Now um we have to get down to the nitty-gritty of how to make this and this remote control has to be sold um we're to sell it for twenty five Euros , with a profit aim ultimately of fifty million Euros . 
UNKNOWN That tells you something about how many um we have to sell on an international scale . 
UNKNOWN Um would be an awful lot of these , would be like what , a hundred million of them um to make twenty five Euros on each one and to make a total profit of fifty million . 
UNKNOWN Um the production is to only cost twelve and a half Euros per item . 
UNKNOWN Now if they cost twelve and a half , you're selling it for twenty five , you're making twelve and a half Euros each . 
UNKNOWN Um and we're to make a profit of fifty million , that's t uh can you do the maths and how many are we selling ? 
UNKNOWN Uh yeah . 
UNKNOWN I was just wondering if that's the um If fifty percent is normal B yeah . 
UNKNOWN Mark-up ? 
UNKNOWN Um I would think would be more like sixty percent . 
UNKNOWN But um let me I have two thoughts . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN One hundred , fifty percent . 
UNKNOWN And and your question is how many do we have to sell ? 
UNKNOWN Yes , 'cause our market um is international and your problem is has to do with marketing of you know , you gotta know how many we're going to be selling to know how big a market you have to target and who is that . 
UNKNOWN At twenty five . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's um So that's four million of them ? 
UNKNOWN To give you a pretty good idea of where you're looking . 
UNKNOWN Something like that ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN That's fifty million Euros . 
UNKNOWN In order to make fifty million Euros , and you're only getting twelve and a half each That's a lot of selling . 
UNKNOWN And if we make Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Two four To be fifty , be four million . 
UNKNOWN Four million . 
UNKNOWN You'd have to sell four million . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Okay ? 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Experience with a remote control . 
UNKNOWN Any of you use of remote control for a television or D_V_D_ or something ? 
UNKNOWN That that that's the sorta product we're talking about , one that will work for a in a home environment , for a T_V_s and I think one that works would be good . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN You're both nodding , all three . 
UNKNOWN Well I've seen some remote controls that are for more than one device at a time , but I also have heard about them not working well or not well co-ordinated and you wind up working with this one for thi this three and then this one over here for another . 
UNKNOWN It is true that you always sit around you know , you're sitting on your sofa and you wanna change something , there's five different remotes , and one for the D_V_D_ and one for the video and one for cable and one for whatever else . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Y yeah . 
UNKNOWN And they don't always talk to each other . 
UNKNOWN But I presume this is t I presume this is just for television . 
UNKNOWN Don't know . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Are there any um ideas for the remote ? 
UNKNOWN What would it be for and what group would be be for ? 
UNKNOWN We have to think about that one . 
UNKNOWN We could make a Hello Kitty themed remote . 
UNKNOWN I think one in b bright colours would be good . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN We could totally go for the Japan-a-mation . 
UNKNOWN Well I mean there's also the cachet that um uh the Japanese make great products . 
UNKNOWN Electrical their industrial design is very good . 
UNKNOWN I think one that doesn't have lots of superfluous functions . 
UNKNOWN Like I've got one at home that has well , apart from the obvious , channels , channel up , channel down , volume , you know , subtitles , mute , there's a lotta buttons that I've got no idea what they do , like . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well , that's a really good point , because I think one of the things that being somewhat computer literate , we tend to um go to menus and then make choices , you know , so if it's like an uh volume button , you know , you can go in and say mute or or volume . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN We don't need to have like the l the numbers if we also have uh uh channel up channel down . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN We can make it smart like an iPod , you know , make everything menus . 
UNKNOWN Ooh , closing the meeting . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um I know this sounds like it was very quick , but the I think that's the industrial design is the first one , that's Kate , for the working design . 
UNKNOWN That was quick . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN And user , that's you S Steph , for the technical functions design , and for marketing the user requirements specification . 
UNKNOWN I think there's going to be a lot of we have to help each other and work through this as a group , and I think we all , you know , we like our kitty-cat and our rat and our fish , but I think we all have to like each other um to get this done . 
UNKNOWN Uh as it says , we're gonna get individual instructions , but uh I don't think they allowed a lot of extra time , so I think a little bit of less of this and more at do will set us in good stead . 
UNKNOWN Do you all agree ? 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
UNKNOWN Um then I don't see any reason to prolong it and f we should finish this meeting at ni right now and go into other things . 
UNKNOWN Alright , so this is the end of the first meeting . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
THANKS Thank you all . 
UNKNOWN Uh it fell off . 
UNKNOWN One , two , three , four , yeah , we're ready . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Welcome to this second meeting . 
UNKNOWN Um it's now quarter after twelve and we're given forty minutesum for this meeting . 
UNKNOWN This is a meeting on functional design . 
UNKNOWN Um and I wanna welcome you all and thank you all for doing some research in between . 
UNKNOWN Um I did took the minutesfrom the first meeting and I'll show them to you in a moment . 
UNKNOWN Um I know each of you have a presentationand um in thinking about the forty minutes , I thought it would take only like three minutes for the previous minutes, um each of you having about seven minutes or maybe a little more , maybe a little less for your pre presentationsand a little discussion , because there's I happen to have been told there were some new project requirements and we have to make some uh decision on what functions it will have . 
UNKNOWN Okay ? 
UNKNOWN Is this ap everybody agree with this ? 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN Oops . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um and after the meeting there'll be things to be done and as you can see it says we get to get lunch , um and then some more individual work and then putting minutesaway and individual actions . 
UNKNOWN Um but uh now for the minutesof the first meeting . 
UNKNOWN And go to that one . 
UNKNOWN Um as you can see it was this earlier today . 
UNKNOWN Um Kate , Steph , Sarah and myself in our four capacities were present . 
UNKNOWN I opened the meeting , the product was developed uh and reviewed , and we talked about the financial end of it . 
UNKNOWN Um and it had some implications , um the four million sales target and new ideas of not too many buttons , bright colours and some of the influence of the Japanese . 
UNKNOWN And we closed early so you could then proceed with your research and getting your reports together for tod this meeting Anybody have any questions on those minutes? 
UNKNOWN Are they complete , did they discuss everything that we covered last time ? 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN Uh I think so , we we we talked about the the individual roles that we each had as well . 
UNKNOWN Did I miss something ? 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I'm afraid I incorporated that when I said who was present , but yes , we did , and we did a little bit of uh team building of uh of making the pictures , but I didn't think those were appropriate to the minutesnecessarily . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So um as a group I think we've are they're accepting the minutes. 
UNKNOWN Okay , I accept the minutes. 
UNKNOWN And uh okay . 
UNKNOWN Is that what we're supposed to say ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I do . 
UNKNOWN Good . 
UNKNOWN Um , then we'll move to the three presentations. 
UNKNOWN Okay ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Mm we need to move this . 
UNKNOWN Who wants to go f first ? 
UNKNOWN That's as far as it goes . 
UNKNOWN Uh not really meant to touch those microphones . 
UNKNOWN Oh it doesn't have any on , does it ? 
CONFIRMATION That's fine . 
UNKNOWN Excellent , thank you . 
UNKNOWN Oy , big loop under the table . 
UNKNOWN She said we didn't need to screw it in . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Okay , that looks good . 
UNKNOWN It's doing its thing . 
UNKNOWN There we are . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
THANKS Thank you very much . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN One of the the biggest issues I found about um from last meeting was the fact that we need to sell four million of these um remote controls and I think that this is an opportunity to really take Real Reaction in the direction of of similar of handheld tools that have been used and are used by many of us and to kind of bring the remote control into the si same realm as an accessible um useful electronic device , as opposed to something that is lost in the couch and what have you . 
UNKNOWN So um my main goal here is to re-envision the remote control in in this context and to think about menu functionality and current technology and the fact that it could be interactive with other tools . 
UNKNOWN Um some of the research uh in the market has shown that people really are not happy with remote controls as they are now , and um that means we do need to make some decisions about what what keys or or buttons on the on the remote control to perhaps keep and and what ones to discard . 
UNKNOWN And if we devote some energy into this , I think the um recent productions of Real Reaction , the I go everywhere power and the high definition D_V_D_ players although it makes immediate sense to have our remote control interact with these , I think we can also use this as a platform to make it interact with other tools . 
UNKNOWN And um in fact I think the high definition D_V_D_ players and all of this will come along in the uh will only benefit from the positive feedback from our well designed tool . 
UNKNOWN So again , most uh users really dislike the current look and feel of remote controls . 
UNKNOWN Um fifty percent I think of all these uh numbers the most important is fifty percent of user say they only use ten percent of the buttons . 
UNKNOWN And eighty percent of users , and if we think about this there are a lot of uh television , D_V_D_ , stereo remote control users out there , eighty percent would spend more money on a remote control that looks fancy . 
UNKNOWN Could can I ask where these figures come from , is this market research we've Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um it was market research and there were a hundred people in the room , so eighty out of a hundred said they would spend more money . 
UNKNOWN Now in between , as the Project Manager , they sent me an emailfrom the powers that be um that teletext is outdated um and the internet is coming in as important , but that they want this remote control to only be for T_V_ um with incorporating the corporate image , colour and slogan . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Well I think we can I I think we can really focus on this remote and and again bring the Real Reaction um brand in in and and get some positive marketing for our other tools , even if we directly don't um advertise for the I go everywhere line . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN So an interesting um element was the would you pay more for speech recognition question . 
UNKNOWN So these market research uh uh questionnaires looked into your your uh concern about technology and s specifically wanted to find out information about speech recognition . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Now the early adopters , those of us who grew up with technology and uh luck lucky for us have the uh cash to to pay for it , the young age group without the mortgages and responsibilities , ninety one percent of them would pay more for speech recognition in a remote control . 
UNKNOWN Very interesting , I I leave this up to the group to decide if we wanna use this uh if and you know , the the designers , but ninety one percent , fifteen to twenty five Well , I I I think especially in terms of growth , I think this would be a very smart group to target . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Is that a large enough target market to target it ? 
UNKNOWN I mean s three quarters of the next age group , twenty five to thirty five are interested , and uh with the technologies improving , if we can get these uh Yeah . 
UNKNOWN In real numbers , does the ninety one percent and the seventy six percent translate to ex in excess of the four million ? 
UNKNOWN To Um yes . 
UNKNOWN Or eight million . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN But would you pay more and does it work and is it approachable and and did I know that it was it was an that's a that's a very good question . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I don't know if speech recognition should be um should be included , but I think it's an interesting I think that maybe shows more about uh being open to technology . 
UNKNOWN Um How d I'm wondering how how ou how our target price compares with the the typical price of these things . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Uh it definitely needs uh a lot more research on like how much more it would be and any , you know , existing examples , and what reactions to them have been , and that sort of thing . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Shall I go back ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I expect an Industrial Designer should know that , but if we're aiming to to build this thing for twelve Euros fifty , um is that a lot or a little ? 
UNKNOWN Exactly . 
UNKNOWN I mean I I I uh did not receive any information on that , but I think the competition , sussing out what other people are doing and what's in the pipeline is very very important , because um there is a question about do you want an L_C_D_ screen and and that wasn't responded to , but uh some of the larger remotes do have screens where you can navigate , you know , so it turns into something uh perhaps you all have seen uh the Osbournes where Ozzy Osbourne is is attempting to manage his super entertainment system with something that looks like a uh a small tray . 
UNKNOWN You know , it's I a and I think , you know No , no , you Kate , you're exactly right there . 
UNKNOWN Sh surely he's in the wrong age group . 
UNKNOWN He must be w one of a s small population . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN But I think the key is to get the early adopters , people who are familiar with technology and and uh they'll be Uh , mm . 
UNKNOWN But we're not looking at whether they're early adopters on that screen , that's looking at age groups . 
UNKNOWN Exactly . 
UNKNOWN I yes , and I'm making and I'm making the the uh uh leap that people who are familiar younger people are l are more familiar with technology than than older people . 
UNKNOWN Leap . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Or comfortable , you know , um so I think the most important thing is an attractive streamlined remote control and to be extraordinarily reductionist , power , channel , volume and everything else is is uh up to the designers . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Okay , you had the other power channel . 
UNKNOWN And this is this is also supported by the market research . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
THANKS Thank you . 
UNKNOWN That's my contribution . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
UNKNOWN And we'll turn to the next presentation. 
UNKNOWN I think she said we don't need to screw it in , just stick it in . 
UNKNOWN And then press , what ? 
UNKNOWN F F_N_ and F_ eight . 
UNKNOWN Next to the control button on the bottom , and then F_ eight at the top . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , press them . 
UNKNOWN And then w be patient . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , here we go . 
UNKNOWN Tada . 
UNKNOWN And if you want it to go into slideshow mode , it's that little button there . 
UNKNOWN Can I not just uh do each one in order ? 
UNKNOWN I you can if you like , it it that that just sets it up to do a p a p no that one , that one there . 
UNKNOWN There we are . 
UNKNOWN That ? 
UNKNOWN Yay . 
UNKNOWN That ? 
UNKNOWN Left , left a bit , left a bit , that one , yep . 
UNKNOWN That ? 
UNKNOWN And then you just press the click when you wanna go on . 
UNKNOWN Right , technical functions design . 
UNKNOWN Uh well I think first off , basically I do agree with what Sarah has defined as as uh your personal preferences,yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think we need uh a more streamlined volume with no extraneous functions . 
UNKNOWN So my method was to look at the existing remotes and what functions they have . 
UNKNOWN And what we all need to discuss is whether we want these functions uh pretty much the same as what existing remotes have . 
UNKNOWN If we can build on this with the speech recognition , that's not something I'd thought about at all , but it's also something we can discuss . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um and and I presume we can miss out the functions really to to a video or D_V_D_ remote control , if this is only gonna be a , you know , satellite , cable , T_V_ remote control . 
UNKNOWN T_V_ only . 
UNKNOWN So these are two models of existing remote controls . 
UNKNOWN Uh the one on the left seems to be a fairly uh standard universal remote control . 
UNKNOWN Ugh . 
UNKNOWN It has fast-forward , stop , play , all relating to movies . 
UNKNOWN It also has seems to have channel up and channel down , which is which is more what you'd expect from a , you know , like a Sky or cable remote control where you've got hundreds of channels instead of a merely terrestrial one . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Uh but I think we should be looking more along the lines of the one on the right , which has it also has play , stop and pause and everything , I don't think we need them at all . 
UNKNOWN I think we just need channel selection , volume up , volume down and I think an an enter function where you can access it's not like teletext , but along the same lines , access things on the screen . 
UNKNOWN Uh not related to the internet one that you mentioned , because that'd be far outside our budget and what we want this to do . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN And exceed the requirements they're expecting of us . 
UNKNOWN So it really exceed the requirements , 'cause the requirements really are just want to be able to change channels and functions , which is more a text on the screen thing than uh than actual buttons o I was thinking something some smooth , sleek , little remote control with big user-friendly buttons and uh a menu that you can access . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
UNKNOWN Uh but then I do think we need to discuss the speech um recognition possibility . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Any uh thing else you wanna add ? 
NEGATION No . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN But we could go back to the pictures of the uh , what're they called ? 
UNKNOWN The pictures of the remote controls and possibly discuss what we think about them , but maybe should hear what Kate has to say first . 
UNKNOWN Or if Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Let's hear what Kate has to say . 
UNKNOWN Okay then . 
UNKNOWN Maybe afterwards we could do a uh whiteboard with that your the one on the right as a as a basis . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Whiteboard session . 
UNKNOWN I think the white that one on the right is , as well as less cluttered , It's there but it's Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Definitely less cluttered and I mean but still it's Sorry I was just I'll just uh resume something else I was gonna say . 
UNKNOWN The the style of these is terrible . 
UNKNOWN I I I really think we need to uh not only possibly even materials , like the type of plastic used , but everything including size and shape of buttons , positioning of buttons , the actual shape of the hand-held device , colours , just every e yeah , everything to do with this has to be revolutionised . 
UNKNOWN The ergonomics , the way it fits in your Yeah . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN But So that's that for now . 
UNKNOWN Cheers . 
UNKNOWN Mm , I haven't actually got a display on my screen . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Still , I'll do without that . 
UNKNOWN Okay um , now I wanna bring us down to earth again I'm afraid and talk about the actual practicalities of how the thing needs to work . 
UNKNOWN Um oh and this is the methodology I used in preparing for this meeting . 
UNKNOWN Um basically I've been doing a little bit of web-based research , and if I had a design team , I would've been discussing my ideas with 'em . 
UNKNOWN But the the net result is that I've come up with a first cut for the working design that I'd like to discuss with you . 
UNKNOWN So , let's go back to what the basic function of a remote control is . 
UNKNOWN It's for sending a message , um typically um via infrared . 
UNKNOWN And the the basic components we've got to build in for our twelve Euros fifty are um an energy source , the user interface and which will um in incorporate um an integrated circuit that actually composes the message um based on what the which buttons the user presses , we turn that into a message , um and then we need a sending mechanism to send it to the receiver . 
UNKNOWN Now I would have hoped I think that's my only slideactually , yeah . 
UNKNOWN I would have have hoped to um do you a pretty PowerPointslideof um my first cut design , but unfortunately the technology defeated me , so if you'll bear with me I'll do it on the whiteboard . 
UNKNOWN So we want an energy source which is there . 
UNKNOWN And we've got to think about what that might be . 
UNKNOWN Uh we obviously don't want wires on this thing . 
UNKNOWN Hmm-mm . 
UNKNOWN Uh typically it would be a battery , but I'm open to suggestions . 
UNKNOWN Um and then we have the the user interface . 
UNKNOWN Oops . 
UNKNOWN And the main components in there are the the th the chip that actually has the intelligence of the machine that translates button presses into a message , which it then transfers to some sending mechanism , which encodes it and sends the message to the receiver . 
UNKNOWN So those are the basic things that we've got to get in for our twelve Euros fifty . 
THANKS Thank you . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN But those things as long as we can get those components , the block , that that rectangle for the user interface , is where the user comes in of what what does it look like ? 
UNKNOWN What do the buttons look like ? 
UNKNOWN Uh what does it feel like ? 
UNKNOWN That's where the user interface is really coming into its own . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN The technical end is what's actually gonna be in there , but also it has to be easy enough to change or repair if something goes wrong . 
UNKNOWN For example the battery energy source or um what if the chip , for whatever reason , breaks down after a certain amount of time , do you just replace it ? 
UNKNOWN Um is there any um because it may be in the same area with several other user interfaces , like for D_V_D_s , movies , whatever . 
UNKNOWN Um does it have to have a a way of being segregated from the others , in a different frequency or something ? 
UNKNOWN Well I may be wrong here , but I'd been thinking of this device as being a a cheap mass-produced device . 
UNKNOWN We're trying to sell four million of 'em , um that's that's , you know , that's almost one in every tenth household or whatever it is . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Um and I hadn't thought of it as being a reparable thing , you just if it goes wrong you chuck it out , and that's why I'm a bit concerned . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN I like the idea of speech recognition , that's a great idea , but I'm not convinced we can put it into this box for the price that we need gonna need to hit . 
UNKNOWN Do we have um ki some idea of how much it would cost to create a device that has these basic elements ? 
UNKNOWN Whoop . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Because then No , the chip composer marketing . 
UNKNOWN Isn't that your job ? 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN Oh right . 
UNKNOWN Oh no , the chip composer sender . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Um , I'm I'm I'm hoping that my personal coach is gonna give me some advice on that , if you're asking me , but Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I I don't believe I know , um . 
UNKNOWN What they cost . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Be because then we would ha ha figure out how much we had to play with in terms of user interface and this look and feel idea . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN It does it does seem as if we're just to do something really simple and mass-produced , the which is pretty much the same as these existing models , just maybe a little bit more inspired , but basically just the same . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Inspired ? 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Although what what uh suddenly came into my head is , you know how they always take two A_A_ batteries which which is really not very efficient at all . 
UNKNOWN Could it be possible to have uh , you know , like a rechargeable internal battery , like , well , like an M_P_ three player does ? 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN With that you could jus or a mobile phone or whatever . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN You could you know , you just plug into a power source for a couple of hours , and then it's recharged for ages and ages and ages , and you don't have to worry with replacing A_A_ batteries , which are You'd never need uh batteries would y uh yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well that has another element , which is if every time you're done using the remote you put it on a charger , then you then it has a place . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but it also has a place , so exactly . 
UNKNOWN And it's not stuck down the back of the sofa . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN But then again I d I don't know if this is within our price range or not . 
UNKNOWN That's a really good idea . 
UNKNOWN Well I uh think that's a very interesting idea , but um I'm not a very good industrial designer and I don't know much about what these things cost . 
UNKNOWN I'll do some research for the next meeting . 
UNKNOWN Well it's better than my idea about solar , probably . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Uh yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well solar may not be so good when you're watching T_V_ in the night , but Yeah , I guess . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Well it is just so annoying how No , but just a rechargeable internal battery would probably I mean it might cost more to at first to develop and to install , but for long-term use it'll be so much more convenient and economic than fiddling around trying to replace chunky A_A_ batteries and not having any in your kitchen drawer and you know f Mm . 
UNKNOWN Depen Mm . 
UNKNOWN It would have to sor store up the energy and then use it . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Solar can do that . 
UNKNOWN We may be talking quite heavy then . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN M yeah , that would be too heavy and it'd cost too much . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So do you think we might make that a selling point if it was something that we found we could afford to develop ? 
UNKNOWN Definitely , 'cause I'm thinking in terms of um uh the loss and breakage of um remotes , how much of that is is to do with it not really having a uh a home , a um a nest , a place to live , exactly . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Sort of have its little dock that you could put it in . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So if you can dock it , um you know , you could s argue that this is Exactly . 
UNKNOWN And the dock could look very fancy and that could be your inspiration of having it looking decent . 
UNKNOWN Still I don't know if it's quite within our price range . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause you are talking about another component , like another piece of hardware . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Are we agreed as to what our target group is though ? 
UNKNOWN Pretty much , so that we'd be looking for the younger end . 
UNKNOWN Well I I brought up some exactly , but I think you raised some good questions about are there enough of these people out there , or are they making purchasing decisions ? 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN You know , these are the Yeah , exactly . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I was wondering that , because I ag I agree that there there're people with uh how can I put it , more money than sense and who are liable to buy something new , but Bu but what I was gonna say was , although they they may be buying um , you know , personal music devices and all that , are they necessarily buying T_V_ remote controls ? 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN I I s usually put more money than brains . 
UNKNOWN Oh oh oh I'll make a note of that , Kate . 
UNKNOWN Good , good comment . 
UNKNOWN Because they probably live in a household that has a T_V_ if they're at the lower end of the age range , I don't know . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It might be good to know um uh who , you know , who's actually buying televisions and are we in a uh uh s region where people have more than one television in a home ? 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN I think we've got a big hill to climb here , haven't we ? 
UNKNOWN I mean we've gotta persuade people who've got a remote control 'cause it came with the telly that they should buy our product instead . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Or do we s make sure that it goes to the man through the manufacturer ? 
UNKNOWN We sell to the manufacturer as the remote that goes with it . 
UNKNOWN Right , good point . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah okay , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN That's probably more what it is . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , good point . 
UNKNOWN What would be a more efficient way of doing it ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , and and some of our D_V_D_ players incidentally have them , because we have the relationship with our own department , but moreover we need to to go for the the manufacturers . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN We're not gonna get any resolutions by the end of the day , are we ? 
UNKNOWN Probably not . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Um the other thing that we're supposed to do is make decision on our functions . 
UNKNOWN Our functions , we've so far decided , I think , that power , channel , volume make it attractive . 
UNKNOWN Um it has to have an enter key and of course the number keys . 
UNKNOWN It has to have big user-friendly buttons and sh n definitely we wanna be inspired that the current styles are just plain awful . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Do we need um let me Br actually , um the enter key I have a charthere that I didn't include . 
UNKNOWN Is that agreeable to everyone ? 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um yeah , which might Th yeah , th those are felt like had a lot of charts . 
UNKNOWN Do you want the gizmo ? 
UNKNOWN Throw some light on that . 
UNKNOWN Um actually we're , you know , we are almost a half hour out of the forty minutes , so we have to get close to finishing . 
UNKNOWN Okay , I I my only comment is I think maybe um we could somehow include an enter key in like a power key if power power was enter and pow that was my only just really in terms of streamlining . 
UNKNOWN Ah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um Exactly . 
UNKNOWN Enter , power as a s oh um a sum simultaneous key . 
UNKNOWN Again , you know , thinking of menus or Um well if you're pressing enter , the the thing would already be on , and so maybe um when you press power , initially it turns it on , press power again and use that as an enter um so you press power after you've um well I was thinking maybe you to turn it off you'd have to press power twice in succession , and maybe power follows something like a channel up channel down power , and then that would make that choice . 
UNKNOWN Is that okay with you ? 
UNKNOWN Sorry , I was miles away . 
UNKNOWN Would that uh-huh . 
UNKNOWN H how does that work ? 
UNKNOWN I was re I was reading the chartto be honest . 
UNKNOWN How so so how does that work , how do you avoid switching the thing off when you actually wanna press enter ? 
UNKNOWN Then you'd have to have an off te off key . 
UNKNOWN Okay , yep , mm-hmm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN It's not getting a bit complicated ? 
UNKNOWN Could granny do this , or are we just not aiming at granny ? 
UNKNOWN Well Or y yeah . 
UNKNOWN Or something that has a a turning dial , where at the far end is on or off . 
UNKNOWN Who's got an iPod then ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I don't um I wish . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Anyway , uh that was the only comment about um some of the the decisions people have made , what's most important . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN It's definitely channel , volume , power . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , things like screen settings and audio settings , I would generally do them on the actual television itself , like here you have a you know , a little flap th with a little control panel on the actual box itself . 
UNKNOWN Exactly . 
UNKNOWN Exactly . 
UNKNOWN I I wouldn't know how to do it using a remote control , so um I would say that they are definitely less relevant . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay , well . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Thanks for looking at that . 
UNKNOWN So I guess easy to use is the other thing that we want 'em to be able to do . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN We don't wanna outsmart Hmm . 
UNKNOWN As you said , you know , don't make it too hard for the granny . 
UNKNOWN I just joined that set last week . 
UNKNOWN Um first grandchild arrived . 
UNKNOWN Congratulations . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFUSION Uh . 
UNKNOWN Um so are we agreed then of those things ? 
UNKNOWN And let's go back to agendaand hook me up . 
UNKNOWN D Oh you're fine . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN This oughta be fun . 
UNKNOWN It probably won't go the first time , it'll probably be like a g mess . 
UNKNOWN Come on . 
UNKNOWN Uh it lost it off here . 
UNKNOWN Uh No , it was up there , but I couldn't see it down here . 
UNKNOWN It's fine . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN This time it should be both . 
UNKNOWN There we go . 
UNKNOWN How do you do that ? 
UNKNOWN How do you make it do both ? 
UNKNOWN Um you have to keep doing the financi the the F_N_ and F_ eight to five minutes to finish , thank you a lot for telling me . 
UNKNOWN Ah okay , it toggles through , yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think you have to cycle through . 
UNKNOWN Um right , we're ready to close . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um will be completed q questionnaire , um then we'll have some time for individual work to continue our research um and I'll put some minutesof this meeting together . 
UNKNOWN Um your individual assignments are for um Kate to do the components , for you , Steph , to do the user interface and for you the trend-watching . 
UNKNOWN Um and each of us will get help from our coach . 
UNKNOWN Are we agreed to get ourselves together and then have lunch ? 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Sounds good . 
UNKNOWN Then that's the end of this meeting . 
UNKNOWN And I hope that's good enough for her to tell her that's the end . 
UNKNOWN Okay ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN We didn't come to any sort of decision on the functions though . 
UNKNOWN Well I think I went over the functions and wrote them down and marked them . 
UNKNOWN Alright , well that's fine then . 
UNKNOWN Um that's what I went over and nobody was objecting to them . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um and you'd mentioned I I was just gonna say , could you reiterate the new project requirements , because it they were it has to be for a T_V_ , just to keep myself Yeah , I think I've Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um the teletext is outdated , the internet is important , it's only to be for a T_V_ and it must include the corporate image , colour and slogan um which I think is more in the user uh range , with Steph . 
UNKNOWN So we're still in meeting , aren't we ? 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Sorry , what what actually are these is that the yellow and black ? 
UNKNOWN It doesn't tell me . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN From their I'll just use it from their website . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Okay ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
THANKS Thank you . 
UNKNOWN Hi Kate . 
UNKNOWN Just just carry on . 
UNKNOWN Okay , carry on . 
UNKNOWN Alright um this is the beginning of the third meeting , the conceptual design meeting . 
UNKNOWN Um our agendashould be um that we're opening the meeting , I have the minutesfrom the previous meeting are on the shared f drive at this point . 
UNKNOWN Um and we should each have a presentationto make . 
UNKNOWN Um we have certain decisions to make and we have forty minutes total . 
UNKNOWN It's twenty five after two at the moment , so forty minutes is five after three , um which I'll be keeping an eye on the clock for us . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um there are the decisions we have to turn to , but we'll come back to them in a minuteafter I take us to the minutesof the previous meeting . 
UNKNOWN Right um as we remember , I opened the meeting , the four of us were present , the meeting the first meeting's minuteswere reviewed and approved . 
UNKNOWN Um Sarah , you presented a marketing research reportum which pretty much rep represented that fifteen to thirty five year olds uh it has to be hand-held , power , channel , volume , number keys , possibly a speech recognition . 
UNKNOWN And then Steph did a second presentationum that those functions plus streamlining them with big user-friendly keys that were easy to use . 
UNKNOWN I think all of us agreed with those things . 
UNKNOWN Kate presented a working design of going after going over the basics on the whiteboard um that it should be a simple mass-produced device , because of the twelve and a half Pence cost . 
UNKNOWN Um but we did talk about possibly using rechargeable batteries and having a docking place as a selling point . 
UNKNOWN Um and the new requirements that it for be for T_V_ only um and that it include the l so slogan and colour of the uh corporate design be included . 
UNKNOWN Um the corporate image . 
UNKNOWN So we agreed that the target market would be fifteen to thirty five with more money than sense , that were decision makers . 
UNKNOWN Alternatively it would be a manufacturer to enclose it with the T_V_ , but it still should meet those parameters . 
UNKNOWN Um and that the function we agreed was volume , power , numbers , enter , channels , a way to move between channels , easy to use and hand-held . 
UNKNOWN Um at that point we agreed that Sarah would look at the current cost of competition , what what do the current ones sell for . 
UNKNOWN Um and Steph was gonna look at ec ergonomics . 
UNKNOWN Kate was gonna look at cost and feasibility of the various possibilities that we discussed . 
UNKNOWN And I was to type up these minutesand work on the final report. 
UNKNOWN Is this a fair presentationof what our last meeting was ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN So we're ready to close that and go back to our That one . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN We're up to the point of the Go back . 
UNKNOWN Um the three presentations. 
UNKNOWN So we're going to pull the plug on me and turn to Sarah . 
UNKNOWN Is that okay ? 
UNKNOWN Is that alright with everybody else ? 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Especially since Kate asked to be last . 
UNKNOWN Sarah , I'm sorry if I misspelled your name , I didn't know whether it was S_A_R_A_ or S_A_R_H_ . 
UNKNOWN I respond to either . 
UNKNOWN No worries . 
UNKNOWN You respond to whatever you get , huh ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um , did you do your Hit Ah , there it is . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , Right . 
UNKNOWN Ta-da . 
UNKNOWN Okay , first thing I want to address is um one of the points that Florence brought up , which was uh current cost of the competition devices , similar to the ones that Stephanie uh showed us and and they're uh twenty to sixty Euros , depending on uh branding . 
UNKNOWN Some of them that have a higher brand recognition are on the more expensive end . 
UNKNOWN But I think that with the current um price that we're searching for , we're well within , even on the lower end , of the uh of the market . 
UNKNOWN Mm 'kay . 
UNKNOWN But I'm going to move on to more interesting um more vibrant things . 
UNKNOWN So , I investigated the remote control market in greater detail , and my uh the theme of what I was to work on was uh trend watch . 
UNKNOWN And I know that you all are a distance from cutting edge marketing research , so you know , I'm just gonna try to cloak it in really professional terms here . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN Sorry . 
UNKNOWN I'm glad to see the marketing budget is being so well spent on . 
UNKNOWN What's hot , fruit and veg . 
UNKNOWN Spongy . 
UNKNOWN And this is all over the catwalks , Paris , Milan , and I'm talking about clothing , furniture , shoes . 
UNKNOWN This is really interesting change from past years , because it is much more organic , um some would say approachable . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN And I think if we're to refashion our view of what we want in a remote control , we should perhaps think about incorporating technologically interesting fabrics and some of the bold colours into a simple handset . 
UNKNOWN So . 
UNKNOWN I also did a little research on um what again are the most important priorities in uh decision making about uh purchasing . 
UNKNOWN Fancy . 
UNKNOWN Functional is out . 
UNKNOWN And f the fancy , and that's exactly the term , I'm I'm thinking polished , elegant , you know , kind of innovative , but a cut above . 
UNKNOWN This is twice as important as the next finding , which is technologically innovative . 
UNKNOWN This is interesting , 'cause I think in the last meeting we were talking about technology as being so important , but maybe what's innovative is having it simple with um with uh technologically superior fabrics or uh , you know , designed in interesting substances . 
UNKNOWN Ease of use . 
UNKNOWN Again , pretty low , I mean it's the top three , but each of the uh fancy and technologically innovative are far more important . 
UNKNOWN So I think we should cloak the streamlined remote control device in a series of fruit fruit themed sleeves . 
UNKNOWN I think that's a good idea . 
UNKNOWN Don't you ? 
UNKNOWN Y yeah , you know Exactly . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN It sounds like the the uh covers that they use for the remote , you know , your t your cell phone . 
UNKNOWN Exactly . 
UNKNOWN I was thinking though that instead of having something uh like patterned , you know , so , you know , something similar to a summer dress . 
UNKNOWN you know , it would have like fruit and veg , is that we actually make these spongy . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN They could be ini initially I thought we could start with kind of um fruit that would suit kind of uh a long uh hand-held , so banana , pineapple and pear . 
UNKNOWN Um it could actually the sleeve could take up a lot of the development and the remote control , we'd just need to get reductionist on it . 
UNKNOWN They could be interchangeable , they're spongy , that goes back to ergonomic , and the youngsters love 'em , fun for the whole family , everyone can have their own . 
UNKNOWN So what we're talking about is changing . 
UNKNOWN this concept . 
UNKNOWN Everyone has a T_V_ remote , but then we add in the fact that they could each have their own individual fruit . 
UNKNOWN That's what's hot on the catwalks . 
UNKNOWN So , this is my This is what I'm thinking . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Uh-huh mm . 
UNKNOWN In most families , don't isn't the remote is a remote . 
UNKNOWN Y yeah , but I think I think what this would allow is perhaps a person in the family who had the most opinion about it we all need a remote , but the person who is really perhaps active in personalising , I'm thinking the teenager , the someone fifteen to thirty five would go out and get this additional thing the same way as you mentioned that people would get the cell phone covers . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN So when your dad's sitting there , overriding your decision , going no we're gonna watch this , you can bring out your own remote and be like zap , no we're gonna watch this . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN W and plus I think Uh yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Well actually some households do have three and four T_V_s and they would have a remote for each one , so . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So this is an idea and I I you know , this is exactly what the research has uh has shown . 
UNKNOWN So I really open this up to uh any other feedback . 
UNKNOWN This spongy fruit and veg . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I I think we're gonna have some trouble when we get down to the component design on this . 
CONFIRMATION Thanks . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN Spongy is gonna be difficult , I'm afraid . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN And as for as for um well budgeting as well , if we're gonna have lots of different interchangeable components . 
UNKNOWN I I just have my ear to the market , guys . 
UNKNOWN Is this to the market ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I mean basically we can make these things out of wood , titanium , plastic or rubber . 
UNKNOWN I suppose rubber is the closest to spongy , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Is spongiest , yeah . 
UNKNOWN That would add Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN I was thinking titanium myself . 
UNKNOWN I was thinking titanium , I was thinking it's just I have been influenced by pictures of iPods , and they're also minimalist and shiny . 
UNKNOWN They are and they they would fulfil the uh first um priority , which is fancy . 
UNKNOWN I think many of us would associate those with fancy . 
UNKNOWN Something else we could do is uh call it something that's fruit and veg oriented . 
UNKNOWN We could call it uh The name . 
UNKNOWN Are we talking about the device itself or the c or a cover for the device that would be an interchangeable cov cover as a separate product ? 
UNKNOWN Well it would be uh a a very simple product that would have a spongy sleeve that would be interchangeable . 
UNKNOWN Perhaps perhaps that desi that particular suggestion needs to go back to management and perhaps go to another group to actually design as a separate product . 
UNKNOWN So That , you know , that might be And then we could keep it titanium . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but it's kind of pointless , isn't it ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Let's delegate . 
UNKNOWN Wo would that be agreeable ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN W w would it be helpful if um I described the components a bit , because I think it would give you um maybe bring this discussion back to Earth of what we can actually physically do . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , maybe . 
UNKNOWN Or I think possibly it might be more useful if Kate went next . 
UNKNOWN Do you wanna be next or you want Kate to go next ? 
UNKNOWN Okay , we'll move the Mm . 
UNKNOWN Um You can even have them in different flavours as well . 
UNKNOWN So that if you just wanna sit there and chew on the remote , it could be like pear flavour , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Or s or smelly . 
UNKNOWN Scratchy Uh well I was really thinking a lot about the I_ uh the iMac kind of gel gem tone . 
UNKNOWN Scratch and sniff . 
UNKNOWN It's hot on the streets , guys . 
UNKNOWN Right , well I I I think some of this um you're gonna be a little disappointed with some of the things I have to tell you , but I'm afraid this is the real world . 
UNKNOWN So um I've been looking at the the basics of how these devices actually have to work in order to operate , and I've had some discussions with the ma manufacturing division , who have told me what's actually available , you know , what the current state of the art in components is , and some of the exciting new things they've got , but I'm not sure that it's quite what you want um . 
UNKNOWN Now this isn't a very good overhead , but this is just to show you , this is the innards of a remote control um . 
UNKNOWN I really need a pen or something but uh does my mouse work ? 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN Um oh yeah , can you see my little mouse pointer ? 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN This is this is the a a a remote that's been opened up and that's the the back of the interface . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN And this is a push-button one , so you see these little little buttons here , they're little rubber rubber buttons that go through onto the the board at the back and they push these buttons here . 
UNKNOWN Um and we that's the basic construction that we've got to got to accommodate . 
UNKNOWN We got to have something that pushes the little buttons that um talk to the chip that encodes the message that sends the the message to the receiver . 
UNKNOWN So um I wan I wanna go through not not just addressing the um uh the the points that you made , Sarah , but um doing my presentationin the order I wrote it . 
UNKNOWN So first of all um I wanna talk about what possibilities we've got for the energy source . 
UNKNOWN Um we can have your bog standard double double A_ batteries in a replaceable um little compartment . 
UNKNOWN We can have a hand sorry a wind-up , yeah , which I think is quite an interesting concept for a sorry for a remote control , but i it maybe is doesn't quite go with the um the fruit and veg . 
UNKNOWN A wind-up . 
UNKNOWN Um one that one that I think is quite interesting is the kinetic energy source , where um you you actually get the energy by moving the device , which is quite a ni a nice and neat one . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
UNKNOWN Remember , we only have forty minutes Hmm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN You have to it means that if it's sitting there for a long time it probably won't work , but you have to sort of throw it between your hands every now and then , it'll work . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Or we we had talked about solar power , but I thing that we agreed that that's not so good in the dark . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Now I'm afraid this is the options we've got on on the case . 
UNKNOWN It can be made of plastic , rubber , wood o if you like , or titanium . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um and the nearest we've got to st to spongy there I guess is rubber , but um I'm gonna come back to the advantages of titanium , and basically it can have a flat surface , a curved surface or a double curved surface , but I think if we wanna use standard components , we're gonna have difficulty with anything much beyond that . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Okay , what does the interface look like ? 
UNKNOWN Um well push button , that's that's the one we're all familiar with . 
UNKNOWN Um we can have scroll buttons and the the scroll button can incorporate a push , so you can have it like on a mouse where you can use it to go up and down , change volume or channel or something like that and push to select something . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um you can have multiple scroll buttons , um this is maybe getting a little bit complicated , but um it's it the technology is there . 
UNKNOWN And we can also incorporate an L_C_D_ display in the remote , but this will increase the cost . 
UNKNOWN Um the electronics that actually makes the device work , we've basically got three , simple , regular , advanced , and the price goes up as we choose each of this . 
UNKNOWN If we want the nice cheap one , the simple , then we can only have push buttons . 
UNKNOWN All the other fancy interface designsgo out the window , I'm afraid . 
UNKNOWN Um pay a little bit more for a regular chip and you can have scroll buttons . 
UNKNOWN If you want the advanced chip it obviously costs more , but it that's what you need if you want the L_C_D_ display . 
UNKNOWN And the manufacturing devision tell me that they have recently developed um sample sensor sample speaker devices . 
UNKNOWN Now I don't know what that is , but I think they think it's quite important and we might want to incorporate it somewhere . 
UNKNOWN Um ou our real expertise is in push buttons , I have to say , but maybe you think that's old technology . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN And well I I think we've got two options . 
UNKNOWN We can either go for a really cheap model , keep all of the costs down , um which means a flat plastic case with an ordinary battery and simple push buttons . 
UNKNOWN Or we can have something that looks a bit nicer , I think it , um won't necessarily l uh look like a pineapple , but um that may or may not be a good thing . 
UNKNOWN Sorry . 
UNKNOWN Um but it could have an L_C_D_ screen and it could have multiple scroll buttons , and it could have the the company's new development of the um sample sensor and speaker . 
UNKNOWN So , thank you . 
UNKNOWN That sounds good . 
UNKNOWN Any idea you you mentioned that there would be a cost difference . 
UNKNOWN Um do you have any idea if if this could if the fancy model could be done in twelve Euros fifty ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I'm afraid I don't have that information available . 
UNKNOWN Um manufacturing didn't actually give attach any prices to any of this , I'm afraid . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Because , you know what , I'm being quite serious when I say that that um the things I mentioned are hot . 
UNKNOWN But I think the important thing might be to choose one . 
UNKNOWN You know , if if what you're telling me is is um some of these things aren't just f aren't feasible , maybe we could something about naming , we could call it , you know , Blackberry . 
UNKNOWN Yeah mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN That's uh Alright , well let's see then . 
UNKNOWN Bear bear in mind it has to be the colours and styles of the company , so what I had been thinking was something chunky and yellow and plastic with black buttons with a logo on it . 
UNKNOWN Banana ? 
UNKNOWN But um I I don't know how important that is to keep it exactly the colours of the Real Reaction company . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It's just what I'd understood we'd be doing . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN That's before I heard about all this hot tips about the future , fruit-wise . 
UNKNOWN But yeah , I'm trying to streamline mine a little bit . 
UNKNOWN We we could we could do um a double curved rubber one , which would allow um say a banana , but um unfortunately I see from my notesthat if we do that , we have to have a push button as the interface , we can't do anything fancier . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Shall we wait 'til I've 'til I've showed you what well , my extensive presentationon what sort of interfaces are available . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
THANKS Thank you , Kate . 
THANKS Thank you , Kate . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN You did seem to include just in more detail what I've got though . 
UNKNOWN So so mine's a bit pointless . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN F_N_ and F_ eight , did you say ? 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN There we go . 
UNKNOWN I don't have it on mine though . 
UNKNOWN Oh I think um Florence resolved it by F_ eight again . 
UNKNOWN I If you do F_ uh F_N_ F_ eight again , it's it'll I think it yeah , you you will do an Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Do it again . 
UNKNOWN Keep doing it until you get it in both you get it there , you get it yours without that one , and then you get it with both . 
UNKNOWN Should I do it again ? 
CONFUSION Maybe . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN This time it should come up both . 
UNKNOWN Right then . 
UNKNOWN I don't actually have a huge amount of different information then what Kate says , just that my method was to look at the , well , my my inspirations , which was a big collection of lots of different models of remote controls and other things that use a similar sort of thing , including M_P_ three players , uh like you know , hi-fi remotes , not just television and these things . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Uh having a think about the feature of ea the features of each ones , um what functions we actually need , and then how to group and arrange these on the actual the actual plastic or rubber hand-held piece . 
UNKNOWN Uh I've been especially interested in the iPod style scroll wheel , which Well , I couldn't find a the picture of the iPod w only linked to a web browser , so I couldn't copyand paste it , but it had a similar thing to this thing on the right . 
UNKNOWN It has uh scroll wheels without without a display , but they they scroll like a computer mouse . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN So I was thinking that uh um a really simple a really simple interface with just a couple of scroll things on it um and then instead of a display the display could appear on the television screen . 
UNKNOWN Like I guess an existing Sky or cable one does . 
UNKNOWN Like , you know , you press enter and it comes up with what's showing on that channel at the moment , and you can do you can scroll along and it'll show you what's on in the next half hour , and you scroll up and you can see what's on the other channels while you're watching the same channel on the screen . 
UNKNOWN Uh but I'm also equally taken with this chunky plastic kiddie remote , um which is really nice and fun and good to hold and nice , big , easy buttons to press , but still quite simple and quite cost effective . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN So what seems kind of ideal for me would be to just have a fairly simple , uh not fancy but not totally minimalist , I mean just pretty simple plastic , probably , I was thinking , yellow and black , just because that's the company's colours , with very very few buttons , but that would correspond to a screen that would appear on the television screen , like , you know , just small along the bottom instead of instead of having the iPod style display screen on the actual remotes , which is far too expensive . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN And when you've got a screen sitting there in front of you , you might as well have it appearing uh on the screen in front of you , it doesn't obscure much of the actual picture you're watching . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And so on that you can , just much in the same way as an existing Sky remote , scroll along , scroll up and down . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I'd I'd certainly support that idea . 
UNKNOWN And uh and I definitely support uh the use of plastic and or rubber . 
UNKNOWN I mean titanium would be great , but I think it might be a bit too expensive and too kinda spacey . 
UNKNOWN If we're k trying to keep it colourful and slightly organic , then I think titanium's too futuristic . 
UNKNOWN It's difficult to make fancy shapes in it as well , we can't for example have a double curved case in titanium unfortunately . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Whereas a plastic's so cheap and easy and mouldable and everything else . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Uh then And it's a little bit pointless as well I think . 
UNKNOWN And the the having the the the screen on the television screen I think is a good idea , 'cause um otherwise we're we're putting up the price not only for putting building the L_C_D_ in , but for the electronics as well . 
UNKNOWN It's a duplication . 
UNKNOWN Like when when when you've got when you've got the screen there , it doesn't have to be anything fancy , just a little menu showing yeah , a menu , you go into one menu and then it can have your different options , whether you wanna change the settings or the you know , your information about programme that's on at the moment . 
UNKNOWN There is that . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN I don't think that's to taxing to uh s engineer . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN But as for actually arranging them let me go back to the to the picture of the kiddie one . 
UNKNOWN And I quite like it , 'cause it's just smooth and hand-held and it's got these easily reachable buttons that quite nicely uh spaced out , so something a bit like that with buttons arranged in a kind of circle . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Up , down , left , right . 
UNKNOWN Do you want scroll buttons in that as well ? 
UNKNOWN I I was thinking not actually scroll , like a like mouse scroll , but you know , a I can't quite d uh describe it . 
UNKNOWN you see on the one on the right , down at the bottom , is the mouse . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , see where the mouse is , like this s style thing where you c have up , down , left and right . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN And enter in the middle , so you pick your menu and then your different options and when when you click on each one , it you can go into a new menu for that . 
UNKNOWN I'm getting a bit uh specific here . 
UNKNOWN Really we'd have to use something to show you , but If I don't think I can get it up on the screen . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think I think that's a g nice clean design , it's playing to our strengths which are in push button technology . 
UNKNOWN To uh m make it . 
UNKNOWN Ah here we go . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Oh nice . 
UNKNOWN Um Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Well , the iPod spinning wheel is uh really complicated . 
UNKNOWN Huh . 
UNKNOWN It does scroll , but it is hugely complicated . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN What else have we got ? 
UNKNOWN Wow . 
UNKNOWN Them , they're terrible . 
UNKNOWN But they all have this this feature of this uh It's not quite a scroll wheel , but it's a kind of selection in this circle , which I think is a really good idea . 
UNKNOWN It's a selection wheel . 
UNKNOWN But we can implement it with simple push buttons , which is much cheaper . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , like up , down , left and right . 
UNKNOWN Which is good . 
UNKNOWN And then and then Yeah , so I mean either a channel up and down , volume up and down , next appearing programmes up and down , uh and then also when you get into the different menus on the screen , it's got your things like settings and contrast up and down . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So all you really need is these four buttons with the enter in the middle . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN And that's it . 
UNKNOWN In fact Oh that's really nice . 
UNKNOWN Look at look at this one . 
UNKNOWN Almost impossible to misplace or l or lose . 
UNKNOWN Do you think with um It seems that that uh you guys are quite keen on the plastic , perhaps the something reminiscent of the child's remote . 
UNKNOWN Might take up your whole living room . 
UNKNOWN Do you think we could put it in a in a fruit colour ? 
UNKNOWN And have it abstract . 
UNKNOWN You know , we could call like a fruit name , but it would be a little more abstract . 
UNKNOWN Possibly . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN That also is possible . 
UNKNOWN We we could actually do it in rubber instead of plastic if you'd rather if you feel if you like the spongy Hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN I'm just just throwing out ideas . 
UNKNOWN Just Uh just something else I need to bring to your attention is have you have you seen these on a remote ? 
UNKNOWN Or call it a or call it a banana and have it in yellow . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I'm thinking maybe we need to be a little bit more abstract if the design constraints are so Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN This is actually the volume up and down , but they both say V_ on them , which , when you first look at it , you expect that to be the down , because it looks like a downward pointing arrow , but it's actually the V_ to indicate that it's the volume , so uh we do need to avoid little ambiguities like these . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Nice . 
UNKNOWN Good point . 
UNKNOWN But we wouldn't have a specific volume up and down . 
UNKNOWN If we're having the scroll wheel , then it's gonna double up as all the other up and down functions . 
UNKNOWN Mm 'kay . 
UNKNOWN But then , that's complicated . 
UNKNOWN I wanna thank you all for all your presentations. 
UNKNOWN We have about ten minutes left , in which time we have to make some decisions on the remote control concepts . 
UNKNOWN Um and I think you all have been self-stimulating of working together . 
UNKNOWN Um we need to come up with some specifics of the components , um the materials , things like making the decision on the energy um and the case and the interface type things . 
UNKNOWN So let's Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN They want us to decide what form of energy are we going to use , which the choices that we've discussed were pretty much battery , kinetic or solar . 
UNKNOWN Um this is where Kate's expertise comes in , and our decision making will be a little bit guided by Kate at this point . 
UNKNOWN The You were saying that the kinetic would be useful , that is you just have to move it some and you'd be able to use it um as opposed to a battery that you have to either put it in a recharger or um keep replacing the batteries . 
UNKNOWN Um or solar that you'd have difficulty with it if it's a dark day , that it'll die on you , and no way to do it . 
UNKNOWN That's the day you wanna use the T_V_ . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Um so what's our pleasure here , what would be the cost consequences of each of the three ? 
UNKNOWN Oh unfortunately I don't have costing information . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN I i in terms of workability , I I think the the two front-runners are the standard battery or the kinetic , but I'm sorry I don't figures on the difference in cost . 
UNKNOWN Mm 'kay . 
UNKNOWN What's the uh feelings of the group on the kinetic ? 
UNKNOWN I've used kinetic in terms of watches and it's very very uh handy , you don't even notice um that it's there . 
UNKNOWN It sounds great . 
UNKNOWN I've never come across it before , but it sounds fantastic . 
UNKNOWN Sounds like it could be g a really good economical it would make the whole thing a lot lighter , more convenient . 
UNKNOWN It's Mm-hmm . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN It could tie in with the fanciful design as uh , you know , throw the banana , you know , just gotta keep it moving . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause it's really a quite attractive thought , isn't it ? 
UNKNOWN It's like yeah , a good selling point . 
UNKNOWN So the consensus seems to be use the kinetic if it's at all possible . 
UNKNOWN Be Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But it does depend how much I mean how much it costs and how much more development and research it needs . 
UNKNOWN It costs . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN And and how much you do have to keep it moving , 'cause I'm conscious that watching T_V_ can be quite a sed sedentary activity . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN But I could market that as a um as a a I was thinking actually a a cost saver down the road , in terms of battery , you know . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Do your exercises while you're watching the T_V_ . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN True , yeah , m more more environmentally friendly . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's what I was thinking as well . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN You know , kind of the That's exactly what I was thinking . 
UNKNOWN Thanks for the reminder for five minutes to finish , thanks . 
UNKNOWN Um the next thing that they wanted us to do was look at chip on printas a decision . 
UNKNOWN Oh right , okay , I'd that that's something I maybe should have covered . 
UNKNOWN Um chip on printis just a manufacturing technique um and I would certainly recommend it , I think , because I'm not sure I have an alternative . 
SURPRISE Oh .
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN I i it it's just the way that the the the uh th the way it's ac it's actually built and you you printonto the circuit board like you might printonto paper. 
UNKNOWN What about the ca yeah . 
UNKNOWN Oh , the way we uh-huh . 
CONFIRMATION Oh , okay . 
UNKNOWN Um what about the case ? 
UNKNOWN I think they're talking there about do we want wood , plastic , titanium or rubber , and I think we've discussed not having titanium . 
UNKNOWN One , it's too expensive , um and second , it won't do this double um curves . 
UNKNOWN Um we've sort of eliminated wood . 
UNKNOWN We said plastic or rubber . 
UNKNOWN What's the pleasure ? 
UNKNOWN Well if if Sarah's keen on a spongy feel , the the rubber that we're talking about is the same as you have in those little stress balls , so it's yeah . 
UNKNOWN I'm sold . 
UNKNOWN What about you ? 
UNKNOWN Do you not think it might need like a kind of a hard plastic inner shell with the actual delicate workings inside , and then a kind of spongy Yeah , s thick spongy cover , so it feels like the whole thing's spongy , but actually you're not damaging anything by squeezing it . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Kind of like an internal egg . 
UNKNOWN Cover . 
UNKNOWN Uh-huh . 
UNKNOWN Plastic inside . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Because I mean you could just get carried away with the with the tac Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I'd I'd need to talk to manufacturing again about whether that's actually possible , but I agree , it's uh sounds like a nice idea if it is . 
UNKNOWN Well you do get a bit carried away with things that are tactile , you just wanna stroke them and squeeze them , and Just copythe one on the left . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN And with sports on television . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN You know . 
UNKNOWN Um the next part they want is the user interface concept . 
UNKNOWN I su Then I'll just say I support either from a marketing point of view I support either decision that the designers make on that . 
UNKNOWN I should I should r Which I think technically is just push button and uh I'd certainly support that that that brings the cost down quite a lot and it's something that we're an ex the company's an expert on . 
UNKNOWN I'm sorry to push you , but we only have a couple minutes to finish with . 
UNKNOWN Okay , and it says interface . 
UNKNOWN What type and what supplements ? 
UNKNOWN No um a scroll Well , like four buttons , up , down , left and right with enter in the middle , that will correspond to a menu on the screen . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I'd like push buttons with So push buttons No , it's still it's still plugged in on mine actually . 
UNKNOWN Okay , um that's that . 
UNKNOWN Um this is gonna sound weird , but the next meeting starts in thirty minutes . 
UNKNOWN Whew . 
UNKNOWN And they actually want a look and feel design , user interface design , you can look and see this as well as I can . 
UNKNOWN Marketing they want product evaluation . 
UNKNOWN No we can't , actually . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN Oh my , I'm sorry . 
UNKNOWN That's why I was looking over your shoulder Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Oh , okay . 
UNKNOWN Sorry about that . 
UNKNOWN missed that one . 
UNKNOWN This ought to be fun trying to get this thing to work . 
UNKNOWN Ah , ta-da . 
UNKNOWN Now it's gone again . 
UNKNOWN Ah . 
UNKNOWN You know , I think the the company's s next project should to design a better overhead device that switches immediately . 
UNKNOWN Yes , because I can't even see mine . 
UNKNOWN Next meeting starts in thirty minutes , these are the individual actions . 
UNKNOWN Oh yes . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , right . 
UNKNOWN Um the look and feel design is for Kate , uh Steph gets the user interface design , you get product evaluation . 
UNKNOWN Um the two of you get to play with a Pla modelling clay um to do a prototype . 
CONFIRMATION Great . 
UNKNOWN Uh and everybody gets individual instructions in the usual way . 
UNKNOWN Sounds good . 
UNKNOWN Anything else we need to do ? 
UNKNOWN I don't think so . 
UNKNOWN Go to it . 
UNKNOWN Play-Doh . 
UNKNOWN And that's the end of this meeting . 
UNKNOWN That's for her benefit . 
UNKNOWN That's really all I got , guys . 
UNKNOWN Um almost , there's one more thing I have to get out of the I have to make sure that this attachment will open . 
UNKNOWN I keep forgetting whether I've done this . 
UNKNOWN . 
UNKNOWN Ah-ha . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN We'll open that when the time is right . 
UNKNOWN In the meantime Closing things down , okay . 
UNKNOWN Let's see what this thing does . 
UNKNOWN Does it come up together or disappear one of them or what ? 
UNKNOWN Ah , we came up together , we're good . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Are we ready to start ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN It's now quarter of four . 
UNKNOWN This is a f another forty minute one so it will end at four twenty five . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Our agendais , as before , for me to open the meeting , for us to go over the previous minutes, then for the two of you to present your prototype and for you to g um Sarah present the evaluation criteria . 
UNKNOWN We then have a finance aspect , which is a spreadsheet, an Excel spreadsheet. 
UNKNOWN And I know what you're all thinking of , oh my , um because we're only given a forty minute time period to get it all in , including the production evaluation . 
UNKNOWN So we're going to make a very fast track . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um and as you can see that's what we do next on this thing . 
UNKNOWN So the first thing I have to do is close this so that I can get to Where is it ? 
UNKNOWN Red . 
UNKNOWN I need to open mine . 
UNKNOWN Not the agenda. 
UNKNOWN Agendathree . 
UNKNOWN No that th I want the minutesfrom the previous minutes. 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN That should be there , minutes. 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Uh from meeting three , is it alright with you if I don't switch it to show , just use it as is ? 
UNKNOWN 'Cause this way I can more easily flip it . 
UNKNOWN Okay , um obviously all of us were here for the last meeting , we reviewed the previous minutesbefore that , um each of you made your presentations. 
UNKNOWN Um we discussed the various possibilities based on what was presented in those presentations. 
UNKNOWN The market trend of fruit and veg , mm spongy , uh fancy and elegant more than technologically innovative and that more than easy . 
UNKNOWN Um we decided chip on printwould be used . 
UNKNOWN Um we would use plastic with a rubber casing , I think was the consensus , powered by kinetic energy . 
UNKNOWN There was no decision made on the curvatures or double curvature or straight . 
UNKNOWN Um perhaps the prototype will give us an inkling of that . 
UNKNOWN Um looking like a scroll , but it's really a push button technology , excuse my spelling um that was actually in use , that is uh behind the scenes is push button which we uh according to Kate have a very good uh grasp on doing that in production . 
UNKNOWN Um we decided that separate fashionable covers covering your fruit and veg might be a separate product that could be suggested to management . 
UNKNOWN Um and as suggested um yellow with black buttons with the company logo , a slogan and image might be a good idea based on the requirements that have been provided to us . 
UNKNOWN Um we did have a few production issues and coordination of the various bits and we had some conflict of ideas and cost constraints and we ran out of time . 
UNKNOWN Um we had to follow that up and prepare for the last one . 
UNKNOWN And uh we closed as it ran out of time . 
UNKNOWN Is that a fair presentationof what happened ? 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN Okay , back to this meeting . 
UNKNOWN Um we're down to the prototype presentation. 
UNKNOWN Ta-da . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
UNKNOWN Over to you . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Well . 
UNKNOWN Ooh , two . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , well you see , each made one , we didn't have enough yellow dough . 
UNKNOWN Ah . 
UNKNOWN This is the one that I made . 
UNKNOWN Uh-huh . 
UNKNOWN It is uh curved , easy to hold , hand-held , nice and small with big easy buttons . 
UNKNOWN This is like a scroll , but they are push buttons and they enter takes you into the different menus . 
UNKNOWN Of course we need someone who's experienced with the television . 
UNKNOWN I mean this is the infrared thing that's gonna zap at the television . 
UNKNOWN Uh I'm not quite sure how to make that , but I'm sure it will work . 
UNKNOWN Uh this is on off switch , 'cause I think we do need that , and I think it gives it a nice balance . 
UNKNOWN And it's gonna have the logo imprinted on it uh in there . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um as for what it's actually made of well the function of these buttons is up , down , left and right in the different menus . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Uh position , I presume that just means right right on it , easy to see . 
UNKNOWN The main feature of it is just a simple design , simple , lack of uh buttons all over the place . 
UNKNOWN Right ? 
UNKNOWN Form curved , kind of smooth , hand-held , makes it feel nice to hold . 
UNKNOWN Uh material , I think Kate's gonna tackle that quite a bit , but I think we have two different options , because we did make a another one , which wa uh is in the shape of banana , it's just if you can imagine this as yellow with black buttons , like just like this but in the shape of a banana , which is also nice and easy to hold and feels good and has a similar sort of scroll push button technology , just a slightly different design . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Also with on off switch and infrared uh I had envisioned it in hard smooth plastic . 
UNKNOWN So like uh well , I dunno , what's it like ? 
UNKNOWN I guess like an existing remote control , but molded and smooth . 
UNKNOWN Whereas otherwise we'd thought , like with this one or mix and match , just we were gonna see what you thought , the uh a more spongy rubber cover with spongy buttons . 
UNKNOWN So we have the two options we can follow , either the smooth hard plastic or the spongy rubber , depending on cost restraints . 
UNKNOWN And what we well , what conclusion we reach when we discuss it . 
UNKNOWN Uh material yeah , that's what I have to say about material . 
UNKNOWN Can I scroll down on there and see what else Well colour , I think I definitely have a preference towards bright yellow with black buttons , because that's the company colours , but if anybody's got any other suggestions , I'm quite willing to consider them as well . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So , it just depends what you think about these ideas and if I'm yeah , maybe , Kate , you better say what you think about them . 
UNKNOWN Um well I don't have very much to add . 
UNKNOWN Um the the case oops , that's the uh on off button just come off our prototype . 
UNKNOWN The the case can be either um spongy rubber or hard plastic . 
UNKNOWN We're not absolutely sure about a combination of the two , but it can be either of those . 
UNKNOWN We have the technology to do that . 
UNKNOWN Um and as for the the actual components um , uh Steph just said this is a quite a cheap device to manufacture . 
UNKNOWN We have simple rubber push buttons um which provide all the functionality we need . 
UNKNOWN Um the um the diode that actually does the um infrared is at the end , it's the stalk of the banana , or it's just the thing at the end of this version . 
UNKNOWN Um so that's for material . 
UNKNOWN Colour , well uh Steph's the expert on colour . 
UNKNOWN Um we we don't have any particular restrictions on that . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I think that's all we've got to say really . 
UNKNOWN I thin as for as for the fruit or organic theme , I guess this one is obviously fruit shaped . 
UNKNOWN This one has n banana , yeah . 
UNKNOWN A banana . 
UNKNOWN This one has no obvious connections to fruit , but because it's round and molded , it kinda makes you think sort of organic , touchy-feely , kiddie , it's more like yeah , you'd expect it to be like a child's sorta toy remote control instead of a real one , which I quite like that sort of image . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause it's very big and chunky and child-friendly and Hold them , you see , you know . 
UNKNOWN Would you care to examine the prototypes , see how they feel in the hand ? 
UNKNOWN Curvature , is it to your liking ? 
UNKNOWN Oh I see , the on-off's in the back . 
UNKNOWN Yes , that's so that your index finger automatically goes straight to it . 
UNKNOWN If you don't wanna tire out your thumbs after all . 
UNKNOWN And then you can use your thumb . 
UNKNOWN And it was partly we thought the design looked better , but it could be moved if if marketing feel it's important to have the on off button in a different place . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I could see this thing , unless it's reinforced , having a problem with the you know yeah . 
UNKNOWN Breaking , oh right . 
UNKNOWN Well you see , that's why hard plastic would be quite a good thing for it , because then it'd just be rigid . 
UNKNOWN I like the fact that on both of them the keys play such a prominent role . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN It's really kind of a Mm-hmm mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , we really like we really like that design , I mean it looks just like a logo , that arrangement of the keys . 
UNKNOWN Like a c like a compass point , you know , just up , down , left and right , and we think we could make that quite a good feature . 
UNKNOWN And it's like the the iPod scroll wheel , but better . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But it's also like texting , you don't Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah , I mean it that's what it makes me think of , mobile phones , I was try I was thinking , moving your thumb like this , what does that remind me of ? 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN And it's a very simple design , there's not a lot to wrong , the components are cheap to make . 
UNKNOWN It's texting . 
UNKNOWN It's also in terms of um being lost it's it's quite it looks quite different . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN You know , I I d I have several four remotes , and they all look the same until you get up close and you have to you know , this is really identifiable . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I mean the thing is we do need to develop our technology of I mean actually how to program the menus and what sort of , you know , text box is gonna appear at the bottom of the screen , but we do definitely think that it's a viable option . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN The next item is evaluation . 
UNKNOWN No , okay . 
UNKNOWN Uh if that's if you're finished . 
UNKNOWN Um shall I take your uh power ? 
UNKNOWN Uh yeah , we're finished . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Oh sorry . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN Try again . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN This is going to be a heavily interactive evaluation , and the method here is to evaluate the new remote control in terms of the user requirements and the hot trends introduced by the marketing department . 
UNKNOWN So , this means we're going to go over the priorities that were raised by uh the consumers a as well as incorporate all of our insight into this uh evaluation exercise . 
UNKNOWN So I'm going to go and use the whiteboard , and I've made a list of criteria to look at , and so I'm gonna I'm gonna leave this up as the last thing , but for the evaluation it's going to be one is true and seven is false , going over these different criteria , so one true seven false and I'm gonna now use the um the board . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So um fancy , technologically innovative , easy to use , trendy , buttons , excess buttons , good buttons , ugly , sellable , and other . 
UNKNOWN And in fact I hope that uh you all introduce some additional terms , because these are things that um have been brought up , some of them seem rather close , like they overlap . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , what about price , is that gonna go on there as well ? 
UNKNOWN Mm , yeah , price . 
UNKNOWN Price of materials . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN We'll put price up at the top . 
UNKNOWN Not that we actually know anything about it , but we can we can pretend . 
UNKNOWN Well we will soon , unfortunately . 
UNKNOWN Um Okay , so Did you say ? 
UNKNOWN Come on . 
UNKNOWN No , . 
UNKNOWN Uh okay , so wha how do we feel in terms of is this fancy ? 
UNKNOWN It depends what what you mean by fancy really , 'cause when I think of fancy , I think of it's got lots of extra sort of fripperies and , you know , like baroque curliness and which I'd call these quite uh minimalist , simple and plain , but I mean I do see what it is heavily reliant on appearance instead of pure functionality , so in that respect it is quite fancy . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Yes , a plain , simple , clean design . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN I yeah , so in that respect I think we'll go with that respect . 
UNKNOWN I think just maybe we need a different word other than fancy , I'd say maybe aesthetic . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well we have got s trendy further down , but Elegant , I don't know if I'd call them elegant . 
UNKNOWN Elegant . 
UNKNOWN Elegant . 
UNKNOWN Elegant . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , no these aren't the exact terms that the um Yeah . 
UNKNOWN like stylish or aesthetic . 
UNKNOWN Stylish , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Elegant . 
UNKNOWN We're gon let's use elegant , although the the the people , the word on the street is is Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Fancy . 
UNKNOWN N that um yeah uh the uh is fancy . 
UNKNOWN Did you just break the pen ? 
UNKNOWN So let's let's take it to the next level . 
UNKNOWN Well d we'll just call it fancy then . 
UNKNOWN Well okay , so in terms of elegant , fancy . 
UNKNOWN we'll call it E_F_ um , do we do we think that perhaps and maybe we should say the yellow ? 
UNKNOWN Should we go with the yellow in terms of I think that's a really superior they're both Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I think we n we need to they're both yellow with black buttons , it's just that we didn't have any more dough to represent uh that , but if you can just imagine banana shape with these bits as black . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So what we re really need to decide is whether we want the actual banana shape or just a a purely blob or some sort of abstraction in between the two that isn't that is more curved , like a banana , but that isn't actually recognisable as a banana , you know , with the grooves and the stalk and stuff , so . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN As a banana . 
UNKNOWN I think that many of us are abstract enough to look at the yellow one and say we'll call it the banana . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And of the two I really like I m I like the banana , but I I do like the chunk . 
UNKNOWN The chunk . 
UNKNOWN So that's maybe not something we have to decide just right now , is it . 
UNKNOWN No , but I mean in terms we have to evaluate one of them . 
UNKNOWN Just somewhere a long the scale of in between these two . 
UNKNOWN Unless do you guys wanna evaluate both ? 
UNKNOWN I think between the two , somewhere between the two is true . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I'd I d I don't think that's what we're aiming at with this concept . 
UNKNOWN It's more true than false , about a two . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So we say true . 
UNKNOWN Um technologically innovative . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think we're using simple components that are gonna be robust but not particularly innovative . 
UNKNOWN So we'll say we'll say uh false . 
UNKNOWN Easy to use . 
UNKNOWN Very . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN One , is that inappropriate ? 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Oh , pardon me . 
UNKNOWN Um trendy , s and I say specifically spongy fruity . 
UNKNOWN Trendy . 
UNKNOWN Oh yes . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Well , maybe only a two or a three then , 'cause it's no we still haven't decided about specific sponginess or specific Yeah , I don't really think that's gonna work , but No . 
UNKNOWN We have the worry about how robust it will be if it's it's curved as a banana but spongy . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN I think yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so two ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um are there excess buttons ? 
UNKNOWN Excess buttons . 
NEGATION No . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN So that's false . 
UNKNOWN That is false . 
UNKNOWN Um good , well designed buttons , intuitive buttons . 
UNKNOWN Better , more intuitive buttons , yes . 
UNKNOWN True . 
UNKNOWN Ugly . 
NEGATION No . 
NEGATION No . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN People don't respond well to ugly . 
UNKNOWN Sellable , uh quirky , you know , something people like oh , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I think they're different , aren't they ? 
UNKNOWN Well it is quite it is quite quirky I think . 
UNKNOWN I like it . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I do too . 
UNKNOWN It could be quite a good brand , like a good little object . 
UNKNOWN Oh yeah . 
UNKNOWN And I was I was thinking of other things um in terms of uh could we say it's cost saving ? 
UNKNOWN With the Yeah , with the energy . 
UNKNOWN Oh , we also need tho think about the energy . 
UNKNOWN Is it the kinetic energy ? 
UNKNOWN If it's it is gonna be environmentally friendly with the kinetic energy . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It is going to be kinetic ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , we'll c we'll say it's a cost saving enviro . 
UNKNOWN Uh so yes . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but we haven't completely developed that side of it yet , so we're not completely sure about that , but yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well you're still in the Play-Doh stage . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Anything else ? 
UNKNOWN Including price , do you have any idea about price or other features ? 
UNKNOWN Well I think our instinct is that it should be pretty cheap to develop . 
UNKNOWN We haven't got a lot of expensive components in there . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Yes , the instinct says true . 
UNKNOWN So true one or should I go to two or three ? 
UNKNOWN I'd put it at one I think , but I dunno , what do you Yeah , true , it might be the yeah , yeah , true . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN I would say maybe a two , 'cause we still we need to uh get somebody in who is good with the programming for the menus and things . 
UNKNOWN I mean it's not just like I mean it's not like ev you know , on a normal chunky remote every button res I mean means something different , whereas this one has only got the four buttons and they all they mean everything , depending on what menu you're in . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's not a cheap thing to get . 
UNKNOWN True . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's a good point . 
UNKNOWN uh we need somebody to develop that . 
UNKNOWN Um other ? 
UNKNOWN Anything else you guys can thing of ? 
UNKNOWN And I'm gonna actually change a couple of these so then I'm gonna instead of ugly I'm gonna say it's attractive and then make that true , so that 'cause I have to do an average . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN And then um excess buttons . 
UNKNOWN Just putting no excess buttons . 
UNKNOWN Exactly . 
UNKNOWN Wow we're doing really well . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , be you know , so it doesn't ruin the polarity . 
UNKNOWN As for see if we're technologically innovative , I'd say it is quite innovative , because there aren't really many that have this menu idea instead of all the extra buttons . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN I mean I know we're not doing anything involving internet or speech recognition but but we are at the upper end of the push button market . 
UNKNOWN Or L_C_D_ . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well if you g uh let me know if if any of these um if you if you all can think of any other um thing to change here if you th if you think I should change the innovative or add other features . 
UNKNOWN If not I'll average those . 
UNKNOWN I think we're good . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So Um okay , how about if I uh pass this back to you and I'll uh figure out the average here . 
UNKNOWN We're a little over halfway through the meeting and the next big thing is the finance . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
THANKS Thank you for everyone's help with that . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN And as you can see it says the same thing , it had not lost itself , thank Goodness . 
UNKNOWN And we're going to raise what's called a sp a spreadsheetthat they provided to me . 
UNKNOWN Um and it says fill in the number of components you plan to use in your device . 
UNKNOWN Hand dynamo , battery , kinetic , solar cells . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Well , just kinetic then , . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um what's a hand dynamo ? 
UNKNOWN That was the crank , wind-up crank on the side . 
UNKNOWN It's the wind-up . 
UNKNOWN Oh shoot , forget that . 
UNKNOWN Kinetic is um and how many of those will we need per we only need one . 
UNKNOWN Just one . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Electronic simple chip on print, and we'll need one of those . 
UNKNOWN Uh uh yeah , I think we can do it all with simple Just checking that . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , simple , 'cause we've just got push buttons , so we can do it all with simple which is the ch should be the cheapest . 
UNKNOWN Okay , and we only need one of those . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN Okay , the case will be uncurved and flat or a single curve or a double curve . 
UNKNOWN It looks like it single curve , 'cause of th the chunkiness . 
UNKNOWN It's that's uh uh one . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that that one is single curve , isn't it ? 
UNKNOWN Um do we have I I think you it means you reverse the curve . 
UNKNOWN What does double curved mean , I don't understand . 
UNKNOWN And that's uh that's the the one that goes like this . 
UNKNOWN Oh no , we don't need that . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I do I don't think we need that for either of them , you can do a banana in single curve , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Single-curved , I'd say . 
UNKNOWN No , single curve . 
UNKNOWN Okay , case material supplements . 
UNKNOWN Plastic , wood , rubber , titanium , special colour . 
UNKNOWN I I just wanna say plastic . 
UNKNOWN We had the special colour . 
UNKNOWN And did we say plastic ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , can we do some what ifs , 'cause it may I mean I I still quite like the idea of combining plastic and rubber myself , but it depends on the cost , I guess . 
UNKNOWN One , two , three , four , five , six . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN We'll come back , if we can , to the rubber being added at the moment , that's where we are . 
UNKNOWN Interface button push button interface . 
UNKNOWN It's just button . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN That's what we're using , isn't it ? 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Do we need to say how many buttons , or or d is it just one ? 
UNKNOWN Whoops , don't want that , not yet . 
UNKNOWN Um No , it just says push button interface . 
UNKNOWN Button supplements , they'll be in a special colour of black . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN And the buttons Wha what is the buttons made of , rubber ? 
UNKNOWN Uh they'll be rubber , yep . 
UNKNOWN So we need one of them . 
UNKNOWN And are they any special form ? 
UNKNOWN Well yeah , like the compass point one . 
UNKNOWN Actually , does tha does special material mean that plastic is not a special material ? 
UNKNOWN 'Cause I think they can be plastic . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause the rate we're going we can put the rubber on top . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN They could be plastic , we don't have to have rubber buttons , because we haven't got a double curved case . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN Yeah , they could be plastic . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um let's put that rubber in then , of the case material supplement . 
UNKNOWN It's just one , isn't it ? 
UNKNOWN Uh we only need one of them . 
UNKNOWN Um and the total cost has been calculated as nine Pounds twenty out of the twelve and a half we were allowed . 
UNKNOWN What , we're in . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN We're in . 
UNKNOWN That's us . 
UNKNOWN More profit . 
CONFIRMATION Great . 
UNKNOWN Okay , I'm going to save this into our desktop , project documents. 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN As our project documentbit . 
UNKNOWN Do you do you need to double click on that to open it ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN There we are . 
UNKNOWN That's the only Excel documentthat will be in there , so it's there for all of us . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so , are they under twelve fifty ? 
UNKNOWN Yes , go to the project evaluation , next slide. 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Um the project process , satisfaction with , for example , the room for creativity . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , leadership , teamwork , means , of having whiteboard , the digital pens and all that kind of good things . 
CONFIRMATION Sure . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN And Play-Doh . 
UNKNOWN Uh-huh . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah , the Play-Doh was best , I thought . 
UNKNOWN Yeah well , 'cause I mean it's so hard to describe what you mean just with words and pointing at photographs and saying , well we quite want this , but imagine it rounder . 
UNKNOWN So much better just to go and , you know , this is it , this is what we want . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So , we went over all those things and we're satisfied with all the above . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN Um did we find any new ideas ? 
UNKNOWN I think with the marketing element of uh fruit shaped I I mean I that really opened my eyes . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Spongy . 
UNKNOWN I I only speak for myself though . 
UNKNOWN And I'd never heard of the kinetic energy before , so . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Good work as a design team , because we Oh yes . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I think we're a good team actually . 
UNKNOWN I'm not sure all the wires are really great though . 
UNKNOWN So we actually worked well as a group . 
UNKNOWN I thought so . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Are the costs within the budget ? 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN Is the project evaluated ? 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN I can give you a number , um it's uh the average evaluation score is one point eight eight , so it means w you know , I can I can spell it out . 
UNKNOWN Oh hang on , we haven't heard . 
UNKNOWN Uh-huh . 
UNKNOWN There were six true or ones , four um pardon me , two s almost true or close to true , so that was four points , and then uh one false , seven points , so seventeen divided by nine we're between one and two . 
UNKNOWN I would say that's ex excellent in terms of uh ho how much we adhere to the ideals of the uh market place . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And the the only false one is because we've chosen to keep a simple old technology , which if it works perfectly well I see no point in improving on if it works , so . 
UNKNOWN To maintain old technology , exactly . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Absolutely , and it's kept us within budget . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So we do count as I think excellent or one . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
UNKNOWN And we've therefore we have to do the final questionnaire and do the meeting summary , I have a final reportto present , um and then we're done . 
UNKNOWN . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN We done good , and we're finished in time . 
UNKNOWN Bring on the ice sculptures . 
UNKNOWN Nice . 
UNKNOWN And then we get the product launch party . 
UNKNOWN So we might have to wait . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Product launch party ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN That's what I said , ice sculptures . 
UNKNOWN Absolutely . 
UNKNOWN Um I one thing I want to do is oh , I think the meeting's done . 
UNKNOWN Is that the end of the meeting ? 
UNKNOWN I believe that is the end of our meeting . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
THANKS Thank you , Melissa . 
UNKNOWN Um one thing I wa I wanna do is save everything in the right files , because I don't think everything is saved . 
UNKNOWN The right files . 
UNKNOWN Final meeting market 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFUSION Uh . 
UNKNOWN Right , so agendaof the first meeting . 
UNKNOWN Where we uh We have twenty five minutes for this meeting . 
UNKNOWN We uh are to get acquainted . 
UNKNOWN So does everyone want to say who they are ? 
UNKNOWN that seem sensible ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I'm Robin . 
UNKNOWN I'm the Marketing Manager . 
UNKNOWN I'm Louisa . 
UNKNOWN I'm the User Interface Designer . 
UNKNOWN I'm Nick . 
UNKNOWN I am the Industrial Designer . 
UNKNOWN And I'm Alastair and I'm the project leader . 
UNKNOWN Alright okay , so tool training . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Project plan . 
UNKNOWN So does anyone have any uh thoughts as to the tool training that uh is required ? 
UNKNOWN Tool training . 
UNKNOWN I'm not exactly sure what you mean by tool training . 
UNKNOWN Neither am I . 
UNKNOWN Oh I see , so we shouldn't really be Oh right okay , so . 
UNKNOWN So we have the project team , which is to um basically to come up with a new r remote control device . 
UNKNOWN Uh we have uh the starting base was the original which has been in existence now for a period of time . 
UNKNOWN And uh our idea is to uh to make the new remote control device uh more user friendly than the previous one , and to to be trendier , to be with it , and therefore to uh to get a bigger market share and bigger audience . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So um method of doing this is uh split up as you can see into uh the functional design , the conceptional design , and the detailed design . 
UNKNOWN So um in each of these uh phases we'll uh basically be handing over to yourselves , the designers of this uh this device . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN And uh having uh meetings so that we can uh during the course of the day um come up with a better better inst implement than we had before . 
UNKNOWN And therefore um have a successful uh conclusion to the day . 
UNKNOWN Um and you'll be doing uh various designsuh throughout the day to meet this end . 
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm , okay . 
UNKNOWN So we've got tool training . 
UNKNOWN Try out whiteboard . 
CONFUSION Uh . 
UNKNOWN So we will um . 
UNKNOWN Right so everyone's to uh supposedly uh drawtheir favourite animal over on the white board over there . 
UNKNOWN I guess this is uh make sure the whiteboard works . 
UNKNOWN So uh I don't know who wishes to go first . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Do you wish to go f Have a first bash at uh whatever . 
UNKNOWN I don't mind . 
UNKNOWN I dunno . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Ah uh . 
UNKNOWN Let's see . 
UNKNOWN Good job I got pockets today . 
UNKNOWN Your microphone's just Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But now you you uh you'll move out from the microphone and the camera . 
UNKNOWN I take it that I would I would guess so . 
UNKNOWN Are we supposed to do this right now , do you think , or ? 
UNKNOWN Or Technical problems . 
UNKNOWN You've lost uh your microphone there . 
UNKNOWN I don't know . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN Right here we go . 
UNKNOWN I mean you designers are meant to come up with these sort of things . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN I think that I would have to say that my favourite animal is the cat . 
UNKNOWN Little smiley cat there . 
UNKNOWN Um and this would be because they're very independent , uh they're very intelligent , compared to dogs maybe . 
UNKNOWN Um and they can be very very affectionate . 
UNKNOWN Some people don't think so but I know very affectionate cats . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Um and they can look after themselves . 
UNKNOWN Next . 
CONFIRMATION Okay , yeah . 
UNKNOWN I'll I'll Shall I see if I can get across without just tangling everything . 
UNKNOWN Shall I rub that out , actually ? 
UNKNOWN I don't see as there's any need to . 
UNKNOWN There's plenty of space . 
UNKNOWN I mean whatever . 
UNKNOWN We can have have a whole menagerie . 
UNKNOWN Exactly . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN There's one . 
UNKNOWN We've had more time to prepare over this side , so we've all stuck our bits and pieces in our pockets . 
UNKNOWN Didn't think of that . 
UNKNOWN 'Kay uh pens are over here . 
UNKNOWN The three pens are underneath . 
UNKNOWN I'll try the red pen . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN I'm gonna go for the bear which I'm be able to drawvery well , but I'll have a bash at it . 
UNKNOWN You get marks for artistic impression . 
CONFUSION Uh . 
UNKNOWN Ooh ooh I lost it there . 
UNKNOWN I think I've just knocked the microphone . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN So you're just doing the face . 
UNKNOWN We'll g then we'll go for a a s small small bear . 
UNKNOWN Um and I like my animal that looks nothing like a bear because um I dunno maybe because there's so many cartoon characters made up after the bear like the jungle bookcharacters and stuff like that . 
CONFIRMATION Great . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
GREETING Hello . 
UNKNOWN Um I'm gonna go for the dog , and I'm gonna drawone badly as well . 
CONFUSION Uh . 
UNKNOWN looks like it's going to be a dachshund or something . 
UNKNOWN That's quite good . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN There's my dog . 
UNKNOWN Um I like dogs because they're very loyal . 
UNKNOWN And they're always happy , so whenever whenever you're feeling sort of a bit a bit down or tired , they're always coming up and they're always um quite excited . 
UNKNOWN So um you can always have a lot of fun with a dog . 
UNKNOWN And they're also good for exercise as well . 
UNKNOWN You can sorta get out and they they sorta never get tired . 
UNKNOWN And and when they're tired they're quite cute as well , so . 
UNKNOWN Okay , that's why I like dogs . 
UNKNOWN Right , um . 
UNKNOWN Well I've not actually had too many pets uh over my uh time 'cause to be honest with you uh I'm not too keen on them anyway . 
UNKNOWN Not to worry . 
UNKNOWN So what my daughters have got at the moment is they've got uh a few fish and so hopefully um won't prove too difficult to draw. 
UNKNOWN Uh As you can see that my artist artistic work is useless as well . 
UNKNOWN Anyway um . 
UNKNOWN And uh one of the best uh things about fish is that they don't really take uh too much looking after because uh with most of the animals if you're going away on holiday or whatever , you've gotta spend money or get a friend or whatever to look after them for you . 
UNKNOWN Whereas if you got fish , you just gotta put the food in a a a dripper feed which feeds them over the uh couple of weeks that you're away and uh change the water every couple of months , and buy in a few plants , so . 
UNKNOWN Other than the fact that they keep dying , uh fish are uh are not are are are reasonable pets in that uh they're low maintenance . 
CONFIRMATION Great . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Okay , uh if we're still all with us . 
UNKNOWN Right okay , so . 
UNKNOWN Work has been done on uh this uh project where by um twenty five Euros is uh the uh expected uh selling price . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN That information has come from our marketing manager here . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So we're looking to sell internationally , not just in Europe . 
UNKNOWN We're looking at um having our production costs limited to uh twelve and an half Euro per unit . 
UNKNOWN And therefore making a profit margin of uh well not actually a profit margin it's uh because obviously you're gonna have overheads and various other costs to uh take uh from uh from that to give you your profit margin per unit . 
UNKNOWN And so depending what the uh the overhead uh costs are will determine uh how many units we're uh looking to sell or projecting to sell at this point in time . 
UNKNOWN So um Experience with remote control , first ideas . 
UNKNOWN New remote . 
UNKNOWN So I guess we're looking at um having a discussion at this point in time to help uh you um folks design our our new model as it were . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN So uh any any thoughts ? 
UNKNOWN Um I with some remote controls the buttons were a little small so they're quite hard to press so maybe we make something with uh easy to press buttons . 
UNKNOWN As that is the main function . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so so basically we're looking for some um we're looking for a device that is um robust and and therefore uh won't get damaged too easily . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN Um we're looking for a device that is uh What was the other things you said there ? 
UNKNOWN Um sort of easy to use so the buttons are accessible . 
UNKNOWN Easy to use . 
UNKNOWN Use . 
UNKNOWN is easy to use and see . 
UNKNOWN And see . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFUSION Uh . 
UNKNOWN Can I just check ? 
UNKNOWN Is this just a television remote ? 
UNKNOWN Because a lot of um systems are kind of T_V_ video combined now , or T_V_ D_V_D_ combined . 
UNKNOWN And one of the most annoying things is having like five remotes in the house . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So if you've got a combined system , it could be a combined remote . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Or is it just a television that we're supposed to be doing ? 
UNKNOWN Oh I w um basically I'll get back to you on that . 
UNKNOWN But it seems to me sensible , 'cause as you rightly said , there's nothing more annoying than having three or four devices littered about the uh about the room . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And uh So a device for for all remotes . 
UNKNOWN I've Okay . 
UNKNOWN Sorry , you go . 
UNKNOWN You go . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um one of the things um we found from the market research is that people often get confused by the number of buttons on them as well . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause there's quite often lots and lots . 
UNKNOWN And um sometimes uh they sort of remote controls defeat their own purpose because you're sat in the chair and the remote is somewhere else in the room . 
UNKNOWN So whereas in the past you'd have to get up to change the channel , now you have to get up to sort of pick up the remote . 
UNKNOWN So so I don't we need to sort of maybe think about how um we could maybe uh develop a remote control which moves around the room . 
UNKNOWN I don't know . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Comes to your whistle . 
UNKNOWN That's that's maybe something for the future when you can talk to your television , but Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But is it in a sense it's r um mutually exclusive . 
UNKNOWN You can't have both the th the one device and then have few buttons on it to 'cause you want you want simplicity as well , you want any idiot to be able to use it . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Whilst at the same time you want , as you rightly said , one remote for all . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN And so these are probably mutually exclusive options that uh Hmm you could argue that experience of using devices and similar devices as people get more and more used to using remotes , therefore they're more with handling them , therefore you can make them more complicated as time goes on . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Maybe we could um have better instructions with the remote . 
UNKNOWN Or are we just doing the design of the remote control itself , or sort of the instructions that would come with it ? 
UNKNOWN Better instructions . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I mean we've done some research um about sort of you know what the cutting edge sort of hand held devices are , and a lot of them sort of use you know they're like they're like mini laptops . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So it's possible that we could devise a system where where you're you're basically sort of holding a a miniature computer which is controlling all your your sort of your television , your stereo , and where you know if you buy a new thing then it sort of you can link it to that as well , maybe . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um well we've got five minutes before the end of the meeting . 
UNKNOWN So uh we have to uh start winding up . 
UNKNOWN Um is there Next meeting in thirty minutes . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So um Right , so we've got I_D_ the Come on , where's my Oh there we go . 
UNKNOWN If you just click return it should be okay . 
UNKNOWN It'll get rid of the message . 
UNKNOWN Or not . 
UNKNOWN If you hit just hit return and it should get rid of the message . 
UNKNOWN Oh you've got . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN That's what I was looking for . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN So we've got function Oh what happened to the Right . 
UNKNOWN I think that might be back to the start . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um if you grab the kind of uh slideto the left and pull it down ? 
UNKNOWN slidefour Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Sorry about that . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so we've got um the working design for I_D_ . 
UNKNOWN For U_I_D_ the technical functions design . 
UNKNOWN Marketing , the user requirement specification . 
UNKNOWN Specific instructions will be sent to you by your person by your personal coach . 
UNKNOWN So . 
UNKNOWN Are we all clear what objectives we're looking to meet in the next thirty minutes ? 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN And I guess I'll try and write up some minutesof uh this meeting to uh to give it to you for the next meeting . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN 'Kay , yes . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN I'm not exactly clear on what we're designing the rem remote for . 
UNKNOWN Is this a mun multi-functional one or do we decide that ourselves as we go away and work on it ? 
UNKNOWN I think you just said at the start it was a television remote control , so maybe we should just stick to that unless we get told otherwise . 
UNKNOWN Television remote control . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN That's true , 'cause during during the course of our day we might make decisions based on information or meetings that would change where we're going . 
UNKNOWN Okay cool . 
UNKNOWN But at this point in time I think you're right that uh shall we make it just a T_V_ . 
UNKNOWN Okay ? 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN So we will depart . 
UNKNOWN We will stay here and uh and break off . 
UNKNOWN And I'll do minutesand and we'll see you in half and hour . 
UNKNOWN Okay , that's great . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Okay cheers . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Right s Okay . 
UNKNOWN Right uh . 
UNKNOWN So um . 
UNKNOWN So where's the PowerPointpresentation? 
CONFUSION Sorry ? 
UNKNOWN Microsoft PowerPoint, right . 
UNKNOWN Right , okay . 
UNKNOWN So . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Okay , so we've got uh so we've got new project requirements . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN So basically we've got three things , and we've got forty minutes in which to uh for this meeting to uh to discuss the various options . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Three presentations. 
UNKNOWN We have a I guess we have a presentationeach , 'cause I've got one . 
CONFUSION Um . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I've got one too . 
UNKNOWN I see , right . 
UNKNOWN That's nice to know , one from each of you . 
UNKNOWN Um new project requirements . 
UNKNOWN Um so do we want to do the presentationfirst , or do we want to um W I I got um or or three things basically , um relating to the remote being only for T_V_ . 
UNKNOWN We discussed that last time and in actual fact that was pr pretty well what we came up with anyway . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So in fact it actually f we won't be forestalled in a sense . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um we've got uh teletext outdated . 
UNKNOWN Um did you get any information on that ? 
UNKNOWN Uh we didn't , no . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN Right and the corporate image was the uh final thing . 
UNKNOWN I d I didn't personally . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN So I I got that in emailform . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Right okay . 
UNKNOWN So I guess if we go ahead with the uh with the three presentations. 
UNKNOWN So we'll start with yourself on the basis that uh Sorry , yep . 
UNKNOWN Okay that's fine . 
UNKNOWN I'll just um I'll grab the wire out the back of this one . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN What is it ? 
UNKNOWN I'm not quite sure how it Control Doesn't seem to be quite working at the moment . 
UNKNOWN I think you've got to do um control F_ eight . 
UNKNOWN Shift F_ eight . 
UNKNOWN Alt function F_ eight . 
UNKNOWN Again not doing anything . 
UNKNOWN There's usually a little thing in the top right for the Oh hang on , it's just coming on . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN Ah there , it's doing something . 
UNKNOWN pressed about five times now . 
UNKNOWN Okay , that's me . 
UNKNOWN Okay , um I have to go again . 
UNKNOWN it going ? 
UNKNOWN Hopefully that should be it this time . 
UNKNOWN Okay , I think we're there . 
UNKNOWN That's good . 
UNKNOWN Okay , um Okay I'm gonna be looking at the working design . 
UNKNOWN Um of the of the remote control . 
UNKNOWN Um I've just got three sections , first is the research I made on the on the remote control itself um . 
UNKNOWN And then that involves the components required in it and the systems uh design of the actual the actual remote . 
UNKNOWN Um so having researched the existing models within the market , um I found my research off the internet . 
UNKNOWN Um I've established what the components required for the remote control to function , actually are . 
UNKNOWN And then also the methods in which these components interact together for the remote to actually do what you want it to do and how it connects with the television . 
UNKNOWN Um the basic components are an energy source which I guess um in most existing models would be a battery supply . 
UNKNOWN Whether that'll be sort of two batteries , four batteries , um it may vary . 
UNKNOWN We then have the user interface , which is basically the like the the buttons on the actual remote . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um the various functions used for changing channel , uh channel up and down , volume , things like that . 
UNKNOWN Um there's also a chip inside the remote which does all the computer type things . 
UNKNOWN And then the sender , which um is usually , I've found , an infra-red device which sends a signal to the actual television . 
UNKNOWN Um and the last part is receiver which is important in the system but is not actually part of the remote itself , because that's obviously found in the television . 
UNKNOWN . 
UNKNOWN Um I'm gonna have to actually drawon the board because uh it was a little tricky on PowerPointto get this working , so . 
UNKNOWN I'll just go through there . 
UNKNOWN S um um do we have a cloth to wipe this down with , or ? 
UNKNOWN Oh I'll j Oh I see . 
UNKNOWN I think it's that little Right . 
UNKNOWN Uh there's the rubber on the right , I think . 
UNKNOWN Oh okay . 
UNKNOWN I'll get rid of the bear Okay that's great . 
UNKNOWN it's magic . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so we start off with a um battery suppl Uh no , a power supply which we'd probably get it's probably gonna be the battery . 
UNKNOWN Um we then have a particular button , which may be that's obviously there's lots and lots of different buttons . 
UNKNOWN Um but this is how the basic system works . 
UNKNOWN Um that sends after you press that that sends the message to the chip , which um then sends It sort of interprets which button you've pressed and then sends the appropriate message to the sender . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN So that's . 
UNKNOWN That's the remote in itself , that's the components of the remote and how they work together . 
UNKNOWN So this is the uh user interface . 
UNKNOWN Um this is the chip itself , which then , and that's the that's the infra-red sender . 
UNKNOWN And then on the separate thing we have on the on the television we have a a receiver . 
UNKNOWN And the sender sends a message to the receiver . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN So the the top bit's the power source , yes ? 
UNKNOWN Ah yes , that's the power source . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN . 
UNKNOWN going on to personal preferences , I've said that battery seems the best option for the actual remote , just because of the size . 
UNKNOWN You don't want a a cable attached to the remote otherwise it's not it's not really a remote . 
UNKNOWN Um and then the sender , and infra-red um has been used quite successfully . 
UNKNOWN If the battery's on reasonable power , they always seem to work fairly well . 
UNKNOWN You don't have to be point directly at the television itself . 
UNKNOWN So the battery is the in the sender . 
UNKNOWN Um Yes . 
UNKNOWN 'Kay and that's it for the moment . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So , now more design . 
THANKS Thank you . 
UNKNOWN Mine's not quite as complicated as all that . 
UNKNOWN That's what we like to hear . 
UNKNOWN Did I press function ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Is it control function ei Oh , th there you go . 
SURPRISE Oh .
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Okay so I'm gonna talk a bit about the technical functions design . 
UNKNOWN I'm Louisa , the User Interface Designer , as you know . 
UNKNOWN Um so the m basic method of this is to send a signal from the remote to the television set , so that a desired function is performed . 
UNKNOWN Um an example of the function could be to change the volume up or down , uh so obviously you need two different buttons for that . 
UNKNOWN Um to change the channel , either by pressing the number that you want or by channel up or down . 
UNKNOWN Um to switch the television on or off , maybe a standby button . 
UNKNOWN Um here are two example remotes . 
UNKNOWN Um by the look of it they both have um kind of play and fast forward , rewind functions , so I think they incorporate a kind of video function which we won't have to worry about . 
UNKNOWN Uh but as you can see , the left remote is quite um quite busy looking , quite complicated . 
UNKNOWN Um whereas the right remote is much simpler , it looks much more user friendly . 
UNKNOWN Um so my personal preference would be the right remote . 
UNKNOWN So , it's got nice big buttons , it's got a very limited number of buttons . 
UNKNOWN Um they're nice , kinda clearly labelled . 
UNKNOWN Um I like the use of the kind of um symbols like the triangles and the squares and the arrows as well as the words on the um kind of play functions and all that . 
UNKNOWN So it's very very user friendly , and it's got a little splash of colour . 
UNKNOWN Could maybe do with some more colour . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Well there's a couple of things there . 
UNKNOWN Um we have to remember that we have our own um logo and colour scheme . 
UNKNOWN So basically we'd have to uh we'd have to be putting that on um the the product . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Do we get to see that ? 
UNKNOWN Will you be presenting that in a bit ? 
UNKNOWN I haven't as yet , no . 
UNKNOWN But uh I got uh I got an emailthat basically said to uh make sure that uh whatever device we come up with at the end of the day had to incorporate um the corporate colour and slogan . 
UNKNOWN So uh I'm guessing that uh uh I notice on the bottom there it's got uh what's that ? 
UNKNOWN A_P_O_G_E_E_ that might be the corporate colour scheme , although the only the only colour I can see in that is the red . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Would you be able to get rid of the the extra buttons here , the the sort of circular section , because that seems to be for a video as well . 
UNKNOWN So we could dispense with that little bit as well and just get it down to just the numbers and the volume . 
UNKNOWN What do you mean by the circular section ? 
UNKNOWN Possibly ? 
UNKNOWN Like all of that bottom bit ? 
UNKNOWN J yeah yeah yeah j yeah just this little bit is that I think that's still um a video remote part , so maybe we could get rid of that as well . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And I don't really think that you need nine numbers . 
UNKNOWN Well b uh w Well th the on the Well uh for for general television purposes obviously you have channels one to five at this point in time , and we'd have to have some room for uh future such channels . 
UNKNOWN I mean how often do you use seven , eight and nine ? 
UNKNOWN I think just one to six and then channel up and down should be enough . 
UNKNOWN Like how often do you hit nine ? 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN It's just people are used to seeing that , so if we didn't have them then they might think it's Hmm . 
UNKNOWN But but But , well possibly but the the other thing is that with um the current expansion of uh channels uh in the process of taking place , certainly the button up and down , but uh I mean how many channels do we have to um actual television channels do we have to uh prepare for ? 
UNKNOWN I would have thought that uh it's forever expanding and at the moment we've got although you've onl you've got the five standard , you've got the B_B_C_ have come up with a further six and uh there's uh I don't know exactly how many channels there are on uh when you take into account uh Sky and various other um various others . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So I would've thought that we wouldn't , you know , rather Okay , if the time of flicking from one to other , but presumably it'll take a second 'cause you have to be able to stop it . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Maybe you could have a fast forward on the on the channels that w and then you could dispense with more otherwise . 
UNKNOWN Y you'd want you'd want to get fairly quickly to the channel that you wanted . 
UNKNOWN Um some remotes have kind of favourite options where if you always flick from channel one to channel six , um if that's a favourite you just like by-pass two to five . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I s I suppose in a sense you could have um if you've got a hundred channels then if you had sort of an easy way of getting rather than having to go one to a hundred , you could go one to one to ten , ten to twenty and then have a second button to get you to the actual channel you want and that would cut down your time . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Anyway . 
UNKNOWN But I think a lot of um like Cable and Sky and stuff , that would be tuned to one channel , and then you'd have another remote for all of those channels . 
UNKNOWN Like to get to fifty five and the higher numbers Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Whatever . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Limit the number of buttons , user friendly . 
UNKNOWN But I suppose nine's not really excessive . 
UNKNOWN I suppose with nine you've got the the like the last one which makes the tenth means you uh it's like uh multiples you can put them together so you can make any number . 
UNKNOWN I suppose it does make a good pattern . 
UNKNOWN So with that we'd kind of by-pass any problems with Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well that's true , yeah , you could get fifty by five and a zero or whatever , that that makes sense . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause that facilitates having all the numbers you could ever need . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Um . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Does . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So w so what was the circular thing that you were If it's just for T_V_ , which is what it is at the moment . 
UNKNOWN Um I think that's just for a video , so we wouldn't need any of that at all . 
UNKNOWN So we could get it down to what ? 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So we get to How many buttons have we got ? 
UNKNOWN We've just got ten , eleven twelve th We got fourteen that we need . 
UNKNOWN I guess . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um which isn't really too many . 
UNKNOWN That'll be quite easy to make a user guide for a fourteen button remote . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Well we've we've got um that it's remote for T_V_ only otherwise project would become too complex with uh which would endanger the time to market was one of the considerations . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN I'm I don't know d did you have that information behind the marketing , or was I meant to give you that information ? 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um I'm not sure . 
UNKNOWN I had I've had some market information , but not from the company , no . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Right , okay , so basically time to market seems to be important , therefore speed of delivery . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN We've only got about another four hours left . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so is everyone happy with that ? 
UNKNOWN Ah yes yes , that seems good . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Right well that's the end of my presentation. 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN I'm gonna pull this off . 
UNKNOWN I think if you just give it a second to maybe catch up . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I think she said twenty seconds to um What was that last wee bit there ? 
UNKNOWN Uh-huh . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN I'm sure we'll have by the end of today . 
UNKNOWN I'll give it another go . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , there we go . 
UNKNOWN Right , we've done some research into the functional requirements that people want out of their remote control . 
UNKNOWN And first off we should state that th the remote control's for controlling the T_V_ and um how do people use it ? 
UNKNOWN We asked them sort of which buttons were useful for them . 
UNKNOWN Um how d how does a remote control look and feel for them , and what improvements would would they like to remote control . 
UNKNOWN And we did that by sort of giving them a questionnaire that we'd prepared and asking them to fill in the answers . 
UNKNOWN And three quarters of them found that remote controls are ugly and that a sort of even higher proportion would spend more for a sort of s uh a fancier remote control And that of all the buttons on the remote control , the sort of setting buttons for sort of the picture picture and brightness and the audio settings , um they weren't used very often at all . 
UNKNOWN People concentrated on the channel buttons and the volume buttons and the power buttons . 
UNKNOWN Uh we also asked them about speech recognition uh for remote control . 
UNKNOWN And young people were quite receptive to this , but as soon as we got sort of over about into a thirty five to forty age forty five age group and older , people people weren't quite so keen on speech recognition . 
UNKNOWN There's a lot more th there's a lot lot more older people who didn't know whether they wanted it or not as well . 
UNKNOWN Um we also asked what frustrated people about remote controls and the number one frustration was that the remote was lost somewhere else in the room and that they couldn't find it . 
UNKNOWN And the second second biggest frustration what that if they got a new remote control , it was difficult to learn um all the buttons and all the functions , and to find your way around it . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so My personal preferences from the marketing is that we need to come up with some sort of sleek sort of good looking high high-tech A design which looks high-tech , basically . 
UNKNOWN Um and that we should come up with fewer buttons than most of the controls on the market , and we should sort of concentrate on the channels and sort of power , and also volume and that sort of thing , as as Louisa said . 
UNKNOWN Um we could maybe come up with a menu , a sort of a an L_C_D_ menu for other functions on the remote control . 
UNKNOWN That's worth thinking about . 
UNKNOWN Um and maybe we could think about speech recognition as well , because um sort of young people are perhaps the ones that are gonna buy buy our new product if we aim it at sort of you know sort of a high-tech design . 
UNKNOWN That that might be the market that we're we're looking for . 
UNKNOWN And we could maybe think about using speech recogniti recognition as a way to find the remote control if it's lost in a room , rather than sort of um having it to speech recognition to change the channels . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause there's a problem with that in that the television makes noise , so it could end up talking to itself and changing its channel . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Okay um , and that's the end of the slideshow . 
UNKNOWN That's it . 
CONFIRMATION Cool . 
UNKNOWN Do a lot of um There's key rings um that you kind of whistle at or clap at , I can't remember , and then they whistle back , or something like that . 
UNKNOWN Um about speech recognition ? 
UNKNOWN Speech recognition , right okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But that was only for young people that preferred it , older people didn't . 
UNKNOWN Youn young people pref Yeah , they s they said that they'd be interested in a remote control which offered that possibility and as you go up through the age groups , people got less and less interested in sort of a a remote control that you could talk to , so . 
UNKNOWN No what I maybe think is um it seems the technology would be quite advanced for that and they might end up costing more than our twelve fifty budget for for the speech recognition . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well that's right . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN And possibly the thing about the about the remote being lost we could have You know with your mobile phone , you lose that and you can ring it . 
UNKNOWN Maybe we can have some kind of sensor which is kept somewhere where you can some kind of buzzer system between the two . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So you can press a button which is always kept in one place and then it maybe buzzes to somewhere else , wherever the remote actually is . 
UNKNOWN Uh-huh . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , we'd have t that would mean we'd have to put two products together as well , which which again would probably be a bit expensive , but Yeah . 
UNKNOWN That is true , yes . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Sounds reasonable . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN That'd probably be really simple , they're cheap . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So I guess it'd be something we could like attach to the or like the same technology could be put inside the inside the remote . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So Well if you're trying to avoid having a second product 'cause obviously you could have a second product that gave you the right pitch which would set the remote off to say here I am sort of thing , you know without sound recognition . 
UNKNOWN But if you I know . 
UNKNOWN Um I was gonna say a sharp noise , you know a clapping of hand or whatever . 
UNKNOWN You'd want to try and av just have the one product that if Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah if we if we could have it in the actual remote like everything in one one device . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um I dunno um talking about vo I mean obviously if you've got voice recognition then you can do it in that way because it'll recognise the voice and you can give it a command , a set command whatever that happened to be . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But you've then got the point if if you're not going with uh voice recognition then Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN you could have an option to turn it off . 
UNKNOWN Or Perhaps , um . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So that would solve the problems with the T_V_ kind of speaking to the remote and changing its own channels . 
UNKNOWN So uh Any sugges Well , any conclusions ? 
UNKNOWN Um would it take quite a while to sort of develop the speech recognition software in the remote control ? 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Considering Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well if it does then we can't . 
UNKNOWN It's that simple , because we've got uh th th three um primary um uh requisites from uh from and emailuh that was sent to me whereby we had The design logo was one , which we've already mentioned . 
UNKNOWN We've got um the remote was only for the television and not for because that would make it too complex and we have to get it market quickly . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN And the uh third thing was that um teletext uh as far as uh the management is concerned , um is becoming dated uh due to the popularity of the internet . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So that means that uh so these are the sort of three um extra parameters that have been put on this uh project . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So we're being focused effectively directly at a television and it seems to me that the management is uh wanting us to go down a narrow path and not opening out . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN So anything that uh is to be added , such as voice recognition et cetera has to be very simple and has to be very quick because time to market is is critical . 
UNKNOWN Has to be simple enough to I suppose if we could get something in which was quite quick and simple that would give us an advantage over the other remotes . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN S It would . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN But probably quick and simple is primary rather than added extras . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN Added extras would be nice , but the primary consideration is to get the project finished within uh this short time window , which effectively now is sort of four hours . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So and if and we've gotta get to the end . 
UNKNOWN Uh d d I think I think first and foremost we've gotta get to the end and then get to the end with um added extras if possible . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So About five minutes . 
UNKNOWN Right okay , uh so I need to Right . 
UNKNOWN So I don't know how long we have left of our uh time . 
UNKNOWN But we have to make the decisions on uh the remote control functions and how we were planning to proceed so that at the next uh meeting each person that's got a a a task to do is clear from this meeting what that task is . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN We'll also know w when the next meeting is I um so we'll know how long we've got to complete that task . 
UNKNOWN And then we can reportback at the next meeting and say right okay yes , we've achieved this or we haven't achieved this , this is how far we've progressed . 
UNKNOWN Does that make reasonable sense ? 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Yes that seems right . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay , yeah . 
UNKNOWN So we have to come effectively to the decision on the remote functions so that you can decide what you're gonna be doing . 
UNKNOWN And if dur between the time of this meeting finishing and the next meeting starting , if you get any additional information that uh only you have at that point in time you'd think would be relevant to other people in terms of their des decision making um process , then we should communicate that as quickly as possible and not wait until the next meeting . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Do it via the emailso that rather than coming you know If you get the information just before the next meeting that's fine . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN Come along with it in the next meeting , we can discuss it then and take whatever action is appropriate . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN But if you get it well before the next meeting , let everybody else know 'cause that might have an impact on their uh on what they come up with effectively at the next meeting . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Right , is there I would guess so . 
UNKNOWN So do we need to decide on the functions now ? 
UNKNOWN S Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Well I think it'd be really easy and it'd be a big advantage if we did have some sort of um kind of whistle back kind of function . 
UNKNOWN Yeah and Yeah and that was that was the number one sort of frustration that people said , so . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause that'll solve kind of the frustration of losing it . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN I don't think there's anything else on the market that does that , so . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I don't really know about the voice recognition thing . 
UNKNOWN I w well uh i Something simple . 
UNKNOWN Maybe we should concentrate just on the whistle back function at the moment , and if something comes back I'd go more Yeah , f more for clap . 
UNKNOWN Uh if if our primary consideration is to get it there in time , time's short , you want something to meet the major concerns of the consumer so that we can have that as a selling point for the product , something that's quick and simple . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So , sounds good . 
UNKNOWN And that wouldn't put off the kind of older generation either , 'cause everyone can whistle or clap , and they wouldn't have to be kind of scared of this new technology . 
UNKNOWN Well , so maybe a clap rather than a whistle would be On the basis that if we've got if we're catering to the whole age range , you want something that's easy to do , now something that doesn't like whis uh Well I I I don't know . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN No not everyone can whistle , can they , though ? 
UNKNOWN Well If you think that more people can whistle than clap then that's fine , then go for that option , but if I would have thought that more people could clap rather than whistle , so uh so clap option . 
UNKNOWN No , clapping , I think clapping , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN 'Kay we've already decided that we don't need a teletext button , haven't we ? 
CONFUSION Uh . 
UNKNOWN Is that one of the Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Ef effectively that's what the that's what they're saying , that uh if uh if people are now using the internet then you don't need teletext , so so take out teletext . 
UNKNOWN Taking out teletext , okay . 
UNKNOWN Did we decide on having the ten um the ten numbers and then the the little digit next to it which kind of enabled you to put them together . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Yeah , I think so , so zero to nine . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN I think nowadays you can just get ones where it gives you a sort of a second or two to press another number , so you can press any two and it'll sort of put them together . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay , ten numbers and then some kind of device to allow uh I'll put delay to allow um multiple numbers . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Or multiple digits . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Did we decide anything about um the other functions ? 
UNKNOWN As in setting the audio and tuning it and stuff like that ? 
UNKNOWN You had an had an idea about the menu ? 
UNKNOWN Uh we could possibly put an L_ a sort of a L_C_D_ menu in , but that again is probably an expense that Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But just thinking um people probably I mean you don't have you only have to probably tune in the T_V_ once , but you have to be able to tune it that once . 
UNKNOWN So and if finally the T_V_ breaks , you get a new one , you're gonna have to be able to tune it . 
UNKNOWN You can't really avoid that . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN Except the new digital markets which do it by themselves . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So that'll be in Yes . 
UNKNOWN But the but that's relying on the television market changing to an automatic and if it is at the moment , that's fine . 
UNKNOWN But at the moment it's not , so it seems to me that you have to have a device that caters , 'cause otherwise it would make it uh your device would become inoperable , or only operable in certain circumstances and the idea is to have an international market which is And it's also m it's the the product we've got is something that's at the I would have said the lower end of the s of the cost scale , so we're not really going for something that's uh terribly high-tech . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I s I suppose um if people are buying remotes , then they're probably buying it to replace another remote 'cause all most tellies come with remotes , so . 
UNKNOWN Possibly . 
UNKNOWN I mean we're maybe talking about replacing remotes for slightly older televisions , so we maybe need to keep the the tuning function in . 
UNKNOWN That's right . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So how would this menu function work ? 
UNKNOWN Would you maybe have like one menu button , then you'd use the other buttons , maybe the number buttons to actually do the separate functions . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that would be a good idea , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , like the volume or something . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , 'cause you do need um kind of brightness and contrast and everything as well . 
UNKNOWN My dad was watching a film the other week and it was too dark , so I had to go through it and turn the brightness up . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN we're gonna have the the individual numbers and then a menu function and maybe sort of a slightly more advanced um instruction booklet to come with it , to guide Presu uh I think it'd be quite hard just for people to grasp um just off like the menu use different buttons you maybe have to have like some better instructions of how that would actually work . 
UNKNOWN Uh I'm not sure whether the sort of having people have a booklet 'cause one the second most annoying thing that people found was having to learn the new one . 
UNKNOWN Right , okay um . 
UNKNOWN So maybe next to each of the buttons , you know each of them could have a number and then also a function written next to it , so you're basically pressing Right . 
UNKNOWN that also goes back to the original design when we saw those two , and there was the one on the left hand side which had all like the double functions and stuff which kind of looked too busy and had too much on it , so . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Well , if we're trying to keep it slee sleek and sexy as well , have you seen those remotes where kind of um the bottom bit slidesdown , so there's kind of um everything else revealed ? 
UNKNOWN Okay , well . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So y Ah That's a very good idea . 
UNKNOWN So you don't use it that much , you don't have to see it all the time . 
UNKNOWN But it's all there if you need it . 
UNKNOWN That is that is a good idea actually . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Sor sort of a second . 
UNKNOWN So you keep um Right we've got five minutes before we wind up this meeting , so I've been told . 
UNKNOWN Like a hidden panel . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN I don't know if you've got the same . 
UNKNOWN Uh not quite , but I guess . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So so keep um keep detailed functions um hidden at the back . 
UNKNOWN Keep the other buttons but hide them away . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN And that'll be better for the older generation as well 'cause , well my dad doesn't like anything that you've got to kinda flick through a menu , but he can pretty much read a button if it's displayed properly . 
UNKNOWN Ah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So So um we're gonna have to have to work out what's gonna be on these other functions as as well . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So we're gonna have like two separate two separate lists , I guess . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN That's right . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN data functions hidden at back . 
UNKNOWN So th the The detailed ones would be sort of brightness , uh sorta Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Can bring out when needed . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN That's right so we're dis So you've got which ones are gonna be on the front and which ones are gonna be on the back . 
UNKNOWN So sh Should we decide in the next couple of minutes , and then So on the about the number . 
UNKNOWN We have to decide . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I guess so . 
UNKNOWN So on front , numbers , volume . 
UNKNOWN Um the volume up and down . 
UNKNOWN And the volume ? 
UNKNOWN Shall we have a mute button as well ? 
CONFUSION Um . 
CONFUSION Sorry ? 
UNKNOWN A mute button as well . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah I think they're handy . 
UNKNOWN Or But then they might not buy it if they haven't got one . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN And probably a power one as well . 
CONFUSION Dunno . 
UNKNOWN I know it's probably like um not an issue to raise here , but um the whole thing about not using your standby uh because of the like waste of electricity . 
UNKNOWN Have you seen the adverts ? 
UNKNOWN Like if you boil the kettle that's full that's a waste . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN If you leave your telly on standby it powers Blackpool for a certain amount of time . 
UNKNOWN Like we should maybe try to discourage people from standby . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause people might just be too fickle and not want to change . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , it's maybe too much of a big issue for here . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN We can send out a flier with the device saying that you shouldn't leave it on stand-by . 
UNKNOWN So so are you having the stand-by on the front , then ? 
UNKNOWN Uh-oh danger sign . 
UNKNOWN I think you probably should . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but a little bit smaller . 
UNKNOWN Compromise . 
UNKNOWN Well . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um are we gonna have the channel up and down as well as the number buttons ? 
UNKNOWN Um 'cause yeah the market research said there is quite a lot of people do just zap around and flick , so . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so we'll have um So we've got ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen there ? 
CONFIRMATION Right .
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Channel up and down . 
UNKNOWN What else have we got ? 
UNKNOWN What was that , sixteen ? 
UNKNOWN Numbers is ten , volume is twelve , th Yeah si One up , one down . 
UNKNOWN Volume button . 
UNKNOWN How many volumes ? 
UNKNOWN Right okay . 
UNKNOWN On mute . 
UNKNOWN And a mute , yeah . 
UNKNOWN That's sixteen isn't it , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Is there anything else ? 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN I don't think so , no . 
UNKNOWN Power button , stand-by , channel , up and down . 
UNKNOWN So is that it ? 
UNKNOWN so . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN That's sixteen buttons , you reckon . 
UNKNOWN And then at the back ? 
UNKNOWN You've got brightness and contrast . 
UNKNOWN Maybe if we're gonna run out of time , one of us should come up with a list of these and then get back at the next meeting just at the start and say what they're gonna be . 
UNKNOWN And then Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So on the back it'll have brightness , contrast , anything else ? 
UNKNOWN Uh there's audio functions . 
UNKNOWN You're also gonna have the channel tuner , as it were . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So tuner up and down , I guess . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Tuner , would that have up and down ? 
UNKNOWN Um up Tune one way , tune the o I I dunno I dunno possibly . 
UNKNOWN . 
UNKNOWN I think they normally do . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN And then maybe sort of an enter button for sort of s you know , saying that you want that particular thing tuned in . 
UNKNOWN So you go up and down and then it pick it finds something and then you wanna press enter to select it , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Oh yeah and th and a enter button just to select . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , okay . 
UNKNOWN Um I guess we're keeping s it simple . 
UNKNOWN We don't really need any other audio funct uh functions because it's just volume up , volume down . 
UNKNOWN Um up volume , yeah , I would have thought so . 
CONFUSION Um . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So I think um there's quite a lot of like Dolby surround studio , surround sort of things . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Do they have their own do they have their own controls on their actual products , then , or do you have to do it via the remote ? 
UNKNOWN Um maybe for the younger market . 
UNKNOWN Um I think they've got their own controls in this kind of like hidden panel . 
UNKNOWN Yeah I suppose if we've got their if they've got their own controls then we can avoid it for ours just to keep it simple . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Oh no , I mean um like there's kind of individual buttons for them , like on the T_V_ remote . 
CONFIRMATION Oh , okay . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN But I don't really know what they're for , I've never used them . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN I just know they're something to do with Dolby . 
UNKNOWN Maybe unless something comes up then we should I think Well shall we look into that and just get back together . 
UNKNOWN Well you might get some research . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Right so I'll do the minutesof uh this meeting . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN And we'll meet back at I'm not sure . 
UNKNOWN Um forty minutes , I believe is the time . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Come on . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Conceptual design meeting . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Okay , so Right well um from the last meeting I was trying to send you the minutes, but uh it didn't work out too well , so maybe in sort of um quick summary of the last uh meeting , I can quickly give you what we what we had . 
UNKNOWN Uh right , so Wishing I hadn't closed the damn Right so we had the fact that we're gonna have the the logo uh the company logo in its uh colour scheme incorporated onto the the device the remote device . 
UNKNOWN We had uh made our decisions about uh made our decisions about uh the device itself , that it was gonna be simple to make it uh enable us to complete the project in time . 
UNKNOWN We're gonna have uh effectively two pages, a front pagewhich had the uh features that the uh the customers most wanted , and then the uh the backup features on the second pageso that it could uh meet the technical requirements . 
UNKNOWN And the customers wouldn't have to look at them too often , only as and when required . 
UNKNOWN So . 
UNKNOWN So basically what decisions uh have we uh made ? 
UNKNOWN Uh have there been any uh changes ? 
UNKNOWN I think we all have a presentationagain , so if we go through those and then um . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Three presentation, yeah . 
UNKNOWN Shall I go first again ? 
UNKNOWN So Yeah , fine . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN I see this a little more smoothly than the last one . 
UNKNOWN Okay right , let's get started . 
UNKNOWN Um basically the uh for the Um I'll back actually . 
UNKNOWN For the components design , um next step is basically the the way the remote's gonna work is still the same idea as before . 
UNKNOWN We still have the user interface which is all the buttons we're gonna incorporate . 
UNKNOWN Then there is a chip and still the sender . 
UNKNOWN So um yes including the power s supply as well . 
UNKNOWN Um I'll go on to my findings in each of these areas . 
UNKNOWN Uh first in the power supply , we have the option of just the standard battery , um . 
UNKNOWN There's a dynamo . 
UNKNOWN Any of you think of kind of like the the old torches which you wind up um . 
UNKNOWN There's a kinetic option , which if any of you've seen those new watches which you kind of you power up by waving around , um it just requires a small amount of movement which would mean the batteries wouldn't have to be replaced . 
UNKNOWN Um that's one option , but I think that was gonna cost a little more . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN And then there's solar cells . 
UNKNOWN Um as a final option . 
UNKNOWN For the buttons , we have um an integrated push button , which is Oh just to say all all these are um supplied by Real Reaction . 
UNKNOWN So I guess for the ease of for quickness and ease we should take them from at least like one of these options . 
UNKNOWN Um so for the buttons there's an integrated push button , which I guess is just the same as the standard ones . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN This says it's uh similar to uh the button on the mouse for a normal for like uh like modern computer . 
UNKNOWN Um there's a scroll wheel which is you know the new mouse has just got like the centre section which you can scroll up and down , which may be for the volume . 
UNKNOWN You could do do that . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um one issue for the buttons is , depending on which material we use , if we use rubber buttons then it requires a rubber case , so we have to take that into consideration . 
UNKNOWN Um moving on to the printed s Um that's on the next I th I think the there wasn't too much difference in the cost , that that related to the actual buttons , but it does affect the printed circuit board . 
UNKNOWN What would be the cost do do we know ? 
UNKNOWN Um which is the next section . 
UNKNOWN Basically for the circuit board which is the middle , it's just see it down there the chips like the like the workings of the actual um of the remote . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN The firm supplies a simple , a regular and an advanced um circuit board . 
UNKNOWN And there's different prices according to each . 
UNKNOWN So if we've got the scroll wheel for one of the buttons , that would require a slightly more advanced circuit board than if we just had a standard um push button . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um one final thing we came up with was some information on the speech recognition . 
UNKNOWN There's a small unit available through the company um which obviously would be an extra cost , but it wouldn't affect the size of the remote too much . 
UNKNOWN Um and I guess that would require a more advanced circuit board , so there is an extra price in that sense . 
UNKNOWN There is th sorry an extra cost in that sense . 
UNKNOWN Um going to my personal preferences , um I thought possibly for power we could use kinetic um which is the idea of the watches um that you move you move the remote around to power it up . 
UNKNOWN And this would avoid batteries running out , having to replace batteries and such like . 
UNKNOWN Um for the buttons , I thought we'd probably get away with just having the standard um push buttons rather than the scroll wheel . 
UNKNOWN Um and for the circuit board , again depends on which features we want in the actual in the remote . 
UNKNOWN So if we wanted the scroll wheel and wanted the voice recognition , um then we'd have to get a a more costly circuit board . 
UNKNOWN And that's it . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
CONFIRMATION Thanks . 
UNKNOWN with the printed circuit boards you were going for the Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um i it kind of depends um if we're gonna have the speech recognition , we'd have to probably get an advanced one . 
UNKNOWN I'm guessing . 
UNKNOWN Uh but I don't know , so that is something I'll have to look into . 
UNKNOWN But are we going f R right . 
UNKNOWN Um that's a that's a decision for all of us . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN So are we able to make that decision now in a sense that this is the point at which we're discussing that issue , so would it not be best to rather than I mean one way is to do each of the presentationsand then make decisions going back to the various presentationsas they were . 
UNKNOWN Yeah yeah . 
UNKNOWN We decide . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN The other way would be to do the presentationand then make the decision at that point in time . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's probably a better one , to discuss it straight away . 
UNKNOWN Maybe w Um . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause at that point then you've got the details up there , so if we wanted to know for instance that the scroll wheel required the regular and what required advance . 
UNKNOWN Then if we were able to see that down then we could make the decision at that point in time and then that would be the end of that issue . 
UNKNOWN Does that make sense ? 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um I have a lot of the information there . 
UNKNOWN It might not be very clear . 
UNKNOWN Is there Um . 
UNKNOWN Unless you want to plug it back in to yours . 
UNKNOWN We could do , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um yeah we should . 
UNKNOWN As I say it only specified that we need a more advanced circuit board for the scroll wheel , it didn't The voice recognition came as a separate piece of information . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN No the scroll wheel required the regular , so the Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah if if you down um . 
UNKNOWN It's just this bit at the bottom which I've highlighted , but the scroll wheel requires a mini m minimally a regular chip , which is in the higher price range . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN I think the scroll wheel um Yeah , and if we're going for sleek and sexy , I think a scroll wheel is maybe a bit kinda bulky ? 
UNKNOWN The display requires an advanced chip the display requires an advanced chip which in turn is more expense . 
UNKNOWN Also the display's for something else which we decided against . 
UNKNOWN Um but that bit And note that the push button just requires a simple chip , so that would keep the price down . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Down . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN I I've got um pictures well I've seen pictures with it kind of sticking off the side of it , and they don't really look great . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So maybe just a simple push button , and that would cut costs on the Did everyone get this on the speech recognition ? 
UNKNOWN So . 
UNKNOWN So we're going for p Okay . 
UNKNOWN So is um Simple push button . 
UNKNOWN So are we going for the w are we going for the simple one , are we ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , a simple pushbuttons . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN The um it was basically what we said before , the idea that you record in a set message , and then it picks up that message um and replies to you . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So it is basically the concept we discussed before . 
UNKNOWN Um but then we don't know for sure whether it would require a more complicated circuit board . 
UNKNOWN I'm guessing it would , but got like the definite information . 
UNKNOWN Maybe we should go on what we're certain of rather than Um if it's just the push button then it just needs the simple circuit board . 
UNKNOWN So if we go for the simple push button , so effectively we're going for the simple printed circuit board are we ? 
UNKNOWN Or are we going for the regular ? 
UNKNOWN Mm-mm . 
UNKNOWN But is there any other I mean okay , that's true for the for for that element , but we have to take all el elements into consideration . 
UNKNOWN And so if there is one element that requires the more expensive one , or say the regular one , or the more advanced , then that would have to be the same for all of them . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN S Right . 
UNKNOWN I suppose we need we need to find out what circuit board that requires , maybe before we m make a decision . 
UNKNOWN But But the way that I interpret that um it doesn't seem to send out a signal to the telly , it just it's like a parrot just rep reply replying to your message . 
UNKNOWN Oh yeah , I suppose so , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So maybe that would be something separate , yeah . 
UNKNOWN So I don't think it would effect our circuit board . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so we'd have a simple circuit board and that would be an extra that would be in addition to it . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And I don't think you could really perform any of the remote functions with it . 
UNKNOWN Oh that makes sense . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause the example that they've given there is good morning coffee machine , good morning Jo . 
UNKNOWN Mm-mm . 
UNKNOWN It might be useful to say like where are you remote . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Here I am , Jo . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But I think that's maybe as far as that one could go ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah that makes sense , so we'd stick with the simple circuit board and then think of the speech recognition as an extra an extra possibility . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , just as a fun way to find it . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Simple circuit board . 
UNKNOWN Simple push button . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN W w kinetic . 
UNKNOWN And it says that I think it said the cost of that isn't too much . 
UNKNOWN You were you were wanting to go for the kinetic power supply . 
UNKNOWN Um yeah I I thought so just for just for ease of not having to replace the batteries . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN And how does it get uh charged up ? 
UNKNOWN It's um I think it works on the basis they have some kind of ball bearings inside . 
UNKNOWN It's um it's some on watches which you you kind of you shake to power it up . 
UNKNOWN Somehow the mechanism inside powers up through movement . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So you'd you'd move the remote around a little bit and then that powers it up to use it . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So the speech recognition was Are we going for speech recognition ? 
UNKNOWN No ? 
UNKNOWN 'Cause that required the advanced I had speech recognition requires advanced req require Oh . 
UNKNOWN Um I think it would be helpful to find it , but I don't think it'd um Yeah , I think so . 
UNKNOWN Just Just just for the call and find thing . 
UNKNOWN Uh yeah I think did we decide it didn't affect the circuit board , it just affected It was just Oh no th that's what that's what I thought , but maybe maybe it doesn't . 
UNKNOWN Um I think I might have got that wrong . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause it's s it's separate isn't it , it's not part of the Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So okay . 
UNKNOWN Speech recognition you reckon then is s simple . 
UNKNOWN It's it's just an addition thing it's um yeah . 
UNKNOWN And so we would want it in as an extra because it doesn't appear to cost too much . 
UNKNOWN Would that be In fact , it wouldn't really cost anymore , would it ? 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN 'Kay shall I pass on to you now ? 
UNKNOWN I think I'll just just check what it said . 
UNKNOWN Actually I don't think it really says anything about the cost , but it says that it's already in the coffee machines , so like it's already kind of Um . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I assume it would cost extra , but Maybe we maybe we'll find out how much that does cost and have to decide slightly later . 
UNKNOWN And then have to change all change everything at the last minute. 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN S Sorry ? 
UNKNOWN Oh , that was quick . 
UNKNOWN Um okay , so very brief presentation, um . 
UNKNOWN From looking at the remotes that are out there at the minute, none of them are particularly um sleek and sexy . 
UNKNOWN Um I haven't actually got the examples of the scroll button there , um but there's some curved cases that you can see , uh a range of sizes uh . 
UNKNOWN All of them have a lot of buttons there um they seem to just have the rubber buttons . 
UNKNOWN Does that move it ? 
UNKNOWN It just seems to be skipping on without us doing anything . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I've found that try and get it back . 
UNKNOWN If you right click and then go onto a previous slide. 
UNKNOWN Ah it's alright . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Okay , right . 
UNKNOWN There wasn't much more to say about that , just rambling . 
UNKNOWN Um some of the uh remotes that I looked at , one of the models da did actually have voice recognition where you could um where it was connected to the remote control functions . 
UNKNOWN And uh it was quite uh a swish model , where it can control uh four devices , T_V_ , cable , satellite , video , D_V_D_ , audio . 
UNKNOWN Um so that's a bit of competition there . 
UNKNOWN So I mean maybe it's better not to try and compete with that sort of thing and just to market it as a completely different um like different viewpoint as a kind of finding your lost control rather than trying to compete with the functions . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um the scroll buttons , as you've already mentioned , um there's examples of those , but they don't look as sleek as other models . 
UNKNOWN And there's no real advantage and because it impacts on other on the materials and the price it's not great . 
UNKNOWN On the price , yeah . 
UNKNOWN So you were saying the scroll buttons Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Th there was a specialist type of remote that we could think about , um . 
UNKNOWN There was children's remote , where um they just had a very limited range of buttons and they were b uh bright and colourful and um you you could program them so that they could only look at certain channels . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN Um but I don't know if that's really in our field ? 
UNKNOWN But that's something that's out there . 
UNKNOWN I guess I guess we're going for the biggest market , maybe not , but Was it was it specified that we went for the biggest ? 
UNKNOWN Well we're to go for the international market rather than a local market but that that wouldn't necessarily preclude The one thing that you can often do with products is you can uh make small modifications . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN So you have your basic model which you would sell at whatever , and then you could have additional features in you know like a You'd have model one , model two and model three , and therefore you can sub-divide your market up . 
UNKNOWN But that's really where your field is . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So maybe the children's remote should be like a a next step , but maybe I dunno for ours , maybe we should Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Anyway you could add on for an extra package , but on this basic one I'm reckoning that we're going for the basic model to be discussed here and that uh you would have for future reference the possibility of adding in extra features at extra cost to take care of specialist market segments . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Right well that's something that we can be aware of . 
UNKNOWN Is that So so what are we deciding to do here ? 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN I think because there's already um very good voice recognition technology out there , and because ours might not cover the same functions that the leading brands do , it might be a good idea to market it as a um finder function . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Uh the fi Yeah , the finder function rather than as a speech function to find your remote . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So you also said for going for the international market um that some some maybe older people might not like the speech recognition . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Oh yeah . 
UNKNOWN S s so um Yeah , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Different languages might not be compatible . 
UNKNOWN It w it would make it quite complicated , where um ours at least keeps it fairly simple and then the Yeah , yeah . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , 'cause I think you program um this one yourself , like to say like whatever you want to your question . 
UNKNOWN Yeah and ours is quite a cheap device , so I don't know how much we'll be able to put into it . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So you'd have a finder feature rather than a voice recognition feature . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Maybe unless something else comes up . 
UNKNOWN And you were talking Mm . 
UNKNOWN And you were talking about scroll buttons ? 
UNKNOWN Um yeah I think um I think we've decided that it's gonna increase the cost and give no real kinda extra benefit and it's gonna decrease from the sleekness of it . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN b Alright , so we're just gonna have the the rubber buttons , was that right ? 
UNKNOWN Yes yes . 
UNKNOWN Hmm um and just to be aware that there are kind of specialist functions and specialist remotes but we probably don't want to focus on those like such as the children's remote . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So not to be focused on . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um there was a mention just as kind of a warning about button design . 
UNKNOWN Um just to avoid ambiguity . 
UNKNOWN So it gave the example of say your volume buttons for up and down , they might both have a V_ on for volume , Um let's think how they did this . 
UNKNOWN Good in in Flip it round in ninety degree a hundred and eighty degrees and have it up and down . 
UNKNOWN I'm just gonna check so I do this right . 
UNKNOWN An upside-down V_ . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN So that would show that volume was going up , whereas the one underneath would see the volume going down . 
UNKNOWN What did they say ? 
UNKNOWN Um I think the thing was that if you decide to do this , to have triangular buttons , um somebody might look at this one and say oh well this triangular button is pointing up , and that's the first thing that they see Actually that can't be right , can it ? 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Oh well , no , they might see yeah , they might see this pointing down and think right that's gonna turn the volume down , whereas the actual button's pointing up , so the function is to turn the button up . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So , be careful what you put on the buttons and be careful of the shape that you make them , because they might be kind of two um contradicting kind of shapes . 
UNKNOWN So maybe we could have like Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah I I know what you mean . 
UNKNOWN So maybe we could have volume written on the side and then up and down on the on the buttons themselves . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN You could have volume up and volume Volume up , down and Like that . 
UNKNOWN Possible . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN And 'cause the idea was to have limited um it was to have sizable amount of information on it . 
UNKNOWN Yeah yeah . 
UNKNOWN Limited number of buttons . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause it was sixteen buttons , wasn't it that were Okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah we got it down to not too many . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um and I think that's all I had to say for that . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um so what was the decision on the um design of the volume button ? 
UNKNOWN Um Are we are we gonna go through the design of all the buttons at the moment , or are we gonna t Yeah , maybe we should see yours first . 
UNKNOWN I've I've got some things to say about possible design things from trend watching . 
UNKNOWN Oh okay . 
CONFIRMATION Cool . 
UNKNOWN Right , um I've been looking at some trends in in sort of basically fashion on top of doing the um research into the remote control market the the one that's the one I talked about last time , that we'd sort of asked people about remote controls and what what was good about them , what was bad , what they used . 
UNKNOWN And we've also been looking at sort of fa sort of fashions and what people are wanting out of consumer goods at the moment . 
UNKNOWN So we've had people in Paris and Milan watching the uh fashion trends . 
UNKNOWN You know yourself . 
UNKNOWN So So just to summarise the most important things which came out of the remote control market investigation . 
UNKNOWN The most important thing was that the thing sort of look and felt fancy rather than just functional . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN And second , there should be some technological innovation . 
UNKNOWN And then third and l less important than the other two , there should be an ease of use as well . 
UNKNOWN And apparently , the fashion trends are that people want sort of clothes and shoes and things with a fruit and vegetables theme . 
UNKNOWN Um but um the feel of the material should be spongy , which is contrary to last year , apparently . 
UNKNOWN I presume it must have been not not spongy last year . 
UNKNOWN So we need to emphasise the fancy design with on on our remote control above all else . 
UNKNOWN And then also try and add in technological informat innovation which could be our sort of find the thing with a hand clap . 
UNKNOWN And then we need to ma sort of make it easy to use that's as a third priority , so perhaps um fewer fewer buttons and functions as we've as we've discussed . 
UNKNOWN And then maybe find a way to incorporate these trends so that we sort of capture people's imaginations . 
UNKNOWN So maybe we could make the buttons shaped like fruit and veg , or the the buttons could be spongy , uh somehow . 
UNKNOWN Maybe we could make them out of rubber rather than sort of hard plastic . 
UNKNOWN And then sort of even wackier than that , we could maybe have a fruit or vegetable shaped remote , say in the shape of a banana or something like that . 
UNKNOWN Right , so that'll be it . 
UNKNOWN Maybe a banana or courgette or something . 
UNKNOWN How how far we actually want to go along and sort of follow the trends , do we think the trends are particularly important for this type of gadget , or or you know , do they not matter that much ? 
UNKNOWN I think if you start making the buttons fruit shaped , it might make it more complicated to use . 
UNKNOWN Well you were just talking about you've got to be careful how you shape your buttons , 'cause you're can mis-direct people . 
UNKNOWN And I would've thought the functionality 'cause the people get cheesed off by things by having to read instructions et cetera , so . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN .. . 
UNKNOWN Maybe just one button , say the standby button is quite kinda separate from all the other functions . 
UNKNOWN Maybe that could be a little apple . 
UNKNOWN And then that wouldn't get in the way of like kinda one to nine , and it wouldn't confuse the numbers . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Maybe yeah . 
UNKNOWN Now ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Stand-by button . 
UNKNOWN No th that that incorporates the trend whilst at the same time not confusing people , if you're looking for functionality . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Well I dunno I I guess maybe fruit and vegetables may be popular at the moment , but as we know how fickle the fashion markets are , maybe I mean it just seems realistic that the remote control market isn't the kind of thing which takes in those kinds of fashion trends . 
UNKNOWN But what are they gonna be next Yeah . 
UNKNOWN What are they gonna be next year . 
UNKNOWN Yeah yeah . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN But but th but okay but you you can incorporate the tr If y if you change all the buttons then you've got the problem that this year's fruit and veg , next year's uh I was gonna say animals or elephants or w whatever . 
UNKNOWN S But I suppose as long as it's quite a subtle design , um even if the design kind of changes , It seems like you're gonna have rubber cases , as well as buttons . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I'm not Yeah . 
UNKNOWN That means you're constantly changing your production schedule , and you've gotta make different moulds and everything else , so that's not a good idea I would I would suggest . 
UNKNOWN I'm not I'm not sure what what what the sort of timescale we're thinking of selling the product over is . 
UNKNOWN I don't know . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah . 
UNKNOWN to something which is maybe more universal . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Well Ah d d But if Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN We c maybe can imply a fruit shape possibly . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Maybe the spongy feel is something we could think about , um . 
UNKNOWN Well . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN Maybe still with a rubber design we could Um . 
UNKNOWN Was that in the sort of fashion sense that this Or was the spongy feel was that uh sort of fashion ? 
UNKNOWN It was , wasn't it ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So the Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And that you can make them curved or double-curved and that would be the kind of sleek and sexy look . 
UNKNOWN Oh yeah yeah one of the things were if you had rubber buttons then you had to have a rubber case . 
UNKNOWN Oh right , that fits , doesn't it ? 
UNKNOWN Um oh no no no sorry it's if you use the uh rubber double curved case then you must use rubber buttons . 
UNKNOWN That's the way round . 
UNKNOWN If you have the rubber case then you have to have the rubber buttons to go with it . 
UNKNOWN Which makes sense . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Rubber buttons require rubber case . 
UNKNOWN And that would fit in with what we want , wouldn't it , for the spongy feel , to have everything rubber . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Uh so , yeah . 
UNKNOWN The m the main problem is how f how frequently do the fashions change ? 
UNKNOWN 'Cause in essence in the production you want things to stay you want to basically mint them out 'cause if you've got fashion changes and that you're incorporating , then it means that your stock is um is last year's stock and therefore you're selling it or having to sell it at a discounted rate which you wouldn't want to do . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Whereas if you kept the product the same but you could have a difference from year to year , uh it seems to me that you could incorporate a fashion statement if you like , rather than changing the whole kit and caboodle . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN You're just changing one aspect like like the standby button or something like that , and especially 'cause then you could make it something that Well , you might be limited in space , that yes . 
UNKNOWN I suppose we maybe are limited in the fact that we still have to put the logo on the actual would or not . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Well you two are obviously gonna find that out fairly quickly when you move over to your kit modelling stage as to uh how much pl how much how much how pliable is Plasticine . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Yes yes . 
UNKNOWN Maybe we could think of the the cases like changing with the fashions like the Nokia phones where you could take the casing off the outside . 
UNKNOWN But whether that would be too much to incorporate in production , whether that would just increase the costs , make it more complicated . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN That's possibly it . 
UNKNOWN So you're talking there about uh changing changing the casing . 
UNKNOWN Yeah the a the actual the sort of the look from the outside , so where the buttons would stay the same , and the general function of the remote would stay the same , but you could change the the way it looked . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah and then you could have Oh but you still would have to have the logo on every new case , but you could have like pink cases for girls and red ones and things like that . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's true . 
UNKNOWN Yeah you you could do a colour change , so therefore you would yeah yeah I mean that's effectively what they did with the with the mobile phones , was to have some in blue , some in red , some in rather than all in black or , you know , which four do you want , as long as it's black ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN But uh so Yes oh that's true uh that might no Well not necessarily , because you could have your company uh We're we're meant to be finishing up . 
UNKNOWN So it is a possibility , um . 
UNKNOWN But we are supposed to use the um company colour scheme , aren't we ? 
UNKNOWN We haven't really seen that yet It might and we might be able to do both but it might clash with certain things . 
UNKNOWN Oh okay yes that is Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN You could have your company badge and logo . 
UNKNOWN I mean a lot of um computers for instance like like on the one you've got there , it actually has a sort of um stick on badge so what you would al all you would really need , whether it , you know , whether the casing be w any colour , could be any colour , but that badge would then have to stick out on top of it so that uh in a sense , with a with a logo like that , because it's on a white background , the only colour that it might not stick out so well on would be a white casing . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause you you know you're sort of you're badging it . 
UNKNOWN And in fact a lot of companies get somebody else to make them and literally just badge them themselves with their own uh badge over the top . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN And in fact the way they've got that there even if you had that on a white , which is the predominant colour of the uh the Windows badge , you'd still be able to see it clearly from you know a white casing uh product . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN And whether we'd have a big enough market to have this kind of like secondary market of selling the cases might be something to consider . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Well if it's for young people , um like the phone generation , that sort of thing'd probably go down well , and the market research has been on that side of things , hasn't it ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I mean it's people say that it's the look , they want the fancy looking thing but I'm Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I'm not convinced on whether having changeable covers would be something that people would buy into . 
UNKNOWN I think with the mobiles , it's the , you know it's a communication device , people see you with it all about and i if it Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah I suppose , where you you keep the remote hidden under the sofa most of the time . 
UNKNOWN It's uh in in the house , isn't it , I suppose . 
UNKNOWN I think Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so if we just went for one colour of a rubber case Did we decide on the rubber case ? 
UNKNOWN So don't change case . 
UNKNOWN Change case colour . 
UNKNOWN And we're sort of saying no to that . 
UNKNOWN The spongy feel , or did we think that that might go as a trend ? 
UNKNOWN Well , it was different last year . 
UNKNOWN The trend was different last year apparently . 
UNKNOWN It was not not spongy feel . 
UNKNOWN But I don't know whether the trend will change . 
UNKNOWN I don't know whether it's one of those things that like sort of having all fruit shaped keys , that that probably would go out of fashion very quickly , whereas just the fact that it was a rubber case is probably less less of something that y you're gonna end up hating in a year , you know . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , less likely to So then th th that would Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Sounds reasonable . 
UNKNOWN If you're going for fashion trends like that they'll need t you'd have to have interchangeable cases so that you could or 'cause otherwise someone's gonna have to buy a complete new remote rather than just a case . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN it seems to make sense that we we'd just maybe stick with the standard rubber case , and then have the standard rubber buttons as well . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Uh we haven't really talked about uh the curvature of the case . 
UNKNOWN There's flat , there's single-curved and there's double-curved . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN I'm not exactly sure what these things look like . 
UNKNOWN Mayb Maybe curves give it like the slightly more aesthetic feel ? 
UNKNOWN But the double curve wouldn't require us to perform miracles with the Plasticine . 
UNKNOWN Well it says that I'm not exactly sure . 
UNKNOWN When you say d when you say double-curved , what what exactly does that mean ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um I'll show you the remotes that I've got . 
UNKNOWN See how uh Let's just get that bigger . 
UNKNOWN See how uh the one Oh I'm not plugged in , am I ? 
UNKNOWN No you're not connected to me anymore . 
UNKNOWN That doesn't help . 
UNKNOWN One one thing to cons one thing to consider is that in some ways you want um by having a fairly standard case it means they can all fit together on top of each other therefore for storage purposes in shops and the like and it makes it easier that you can if you can store them up on top of each other . 
UNKNOWN Shall I just turn it round for time ? 
UNKNOWN That should come up . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Whereas if you do um fancy things with it , you then gotta put it in a ca a a packaging box that that does that . 
UNKNOWN And the cost of packaging could be quite important vis-a-vis the total cost of the product . 
UNKNOWN Yeah yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN So shall we go through quickly and just work out what we've decide on , if we have to kind of 'Kay , so shall we quickly We'll go for single curve , yeah . 
UNKNOWN So but No . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um it's not very clear up there , but you can see some of them have got kind of bulges , like the second one and the end one uh where there's a curve there . 
UNKNOWN Mm yep . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN I'm not exactl I don't know if a double curve is maybe it comes up slightly , or ? 
UNKNOWN That's what I was trying to work out . 
UNKNOWN But um it is a kinda sleeker look if you've got curves in there . 
UNKNOWN Oh right . 
UNKNOWN Shall we Yeah . 
UNKNOWN S so do you wanna go for curves , more curves ? 
UNKNOWN We're meant to be f we're meant to be finishing this meeting in about a minute or so . 
UNKNOWN Definitely a single , maybe a double . 
UNKNOWN Shall we go for single curve , just to compromise ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Okay , curved or double curved ? 
UNKNOWN Single curve . 
UNKNOWN So it's single curved . 
UNKNOWN So did we did we decide on the kinetic power supply ? 
UNKNOWN The one you move around ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah I think that think that's a good idea . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um Oh we ca Yeah yeah , we'll still have the Are we gonna go for the simple circuit board just to keep the cost down ? 
UNKNOWN And the rubber push buttons , rubber case . 
UNKNOWN Rubber Rubber buttons and case . 
UNKNOWN Um and we don't really know much about the colour scheme or logo yet do we , but possibly a sticker . 
UNKNOWN I th I think we can by by not having anything too complicated . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Yeah and and the voice recognition , we can use that can't we , just to find it . 
UNKNOWN Yeah yeah . 
UNKNOWN Without affecting the circuit board . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
CONFUSION Um . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN And see we could always decide against it if something comes up that's just something to that we seemed to leave out . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN And then are we going for sort of one button shaped like a fruit . 
UNKNOWN Yeah that sounds like it wouldn't do too much harm in a couple of years . 
UNKNOWN Or veg . 
UNKNOWN Uh what sort of shape do we want ? 
UNKNOWN Don't know , maybe just Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So we've got spongy feel buttons as well , have we ? 
UNKNOWN As well as or w or was that So it's rubber buttons , so it's not really spongy feel buttons , it's just rubber buttons . 
UNKNOWN That's ru rubber buttons , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , it was just 'Kay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN With a rubber case right ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , so it's not too wacky . 
UNKNOWN Reasonably spongy I guess , yeah . 
UNKNOWN And the standby button is gonna be different . 
UNKNOWN Yeah okay . 
UNKNOWN Um I think an apple would be a good recognisable shape . 
UNKNOWN If you start getting into kinda aubergines and things , it gets a bit weird . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay so what what shape are we making the standby button ? 
UNKNOWN Apple ? 
UNKNOWN Vote ? 
UNKNOWN A apple . 
UNKNOWN Oh oh Sorry ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Shall we vote on it ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN We will go for the a a a apples apples . 
UNKNOWN Anyone got any suggestions ? 
UNKNOWN Apple apple a a qu Quite a big one , as well . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Ah . 
UNKNOWN A big apple . 
UNKNOWN Uh Could be a red apple , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well it could be red . 
UNKNOWN Either , don't mind . 
UNKNOWN A red apple ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah 'cause we wanna incorporate a bit of colour if we can , once we find out um Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Is it ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN And then we're gonna are you gonna work on keeping the button design quite simple ? 
UNKNOWN Just like the Just working out what we're gonna do for the next time . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Yeah that seems pretty straight forward . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause most of them will just be kind of mainly circular or like very plain . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Sorry what was that last thing again there ? 
UNKNOWN Uh just to keep the shape of the buttons simple . 
UNKNOWN Right much option on that . 
UNKNOWN I thought you were going for a single curve and Alright . 
UNKNOWN Ah just the uh shape of the buttons . 
UNKNOWN And j yeah , just keeping the sort of the labelling them labelling of them fairly simple as well . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Fairly sort of self explanatory . 
UNKNOWN Right , so shape of buttons simple . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So that's that , I guess . 
UNKNOWN We should now go away and get these things sorted out . 
UNKNOWN I guess you two are on plasticine duty or whatever . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so um . 
UNKNOWN Is that the end ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Looks like it . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Alright , that did nothing . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Welcome to the meeting everyone . 
UNKNOWN Just gonna attempt to make this into a slideshow . 
UNKNOWN Sorry guys . 
UNKNOWN You may have to do the function F_ eight thing . 
UNKNOWN I did . 
CONFIRMATION Oh , okay . 
UNKNOWN Twice . 
UNKNOWN This'll just take a moment . 
UNKNOWN Okay okay Okay . 
UNKNOWN Or it won't . 
UNKNOWN Okay we'll have to deal with it like this then . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN This is the first meeting uh for developing our , our new product . 
UNKNOWN I'm Heather , I'm your Project Manager . 
GREETING Hello . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So um . 
UNKNOWN So that was the opening . 
UNKNOWN The first thing we'll do is get acquainted with one another . 
UNKNOWN If everyone could go around and explain their role and um , and their name . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN My name's Poppy . 
UNKNOWN I'm the Industrial Designer for this project . 
UNKNOWN Um , I'm going to be responsible for the functional design phase . 
UNKNOWN Also the conceptual design and the detailed design for the final product . 
UNKNOWN Nice to meet you Poppy . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN My name's Tara and I'm the User Interface Designer . 
UNKNOWN I will also be responsible for the functional design phase , the conceptual design phase and the detailed design phase of the user interface design . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
UNKNOWN Hi , I'm Genevieve . 
UNKNOWN I'm the Marketing Expert . 
UNKNOWN I'm an expert at marketing . 
UNKNOWN Um , I'll be telling you guys about the user requirement specifications for our new product . 
UNKNOWN Um , I'll be doing some trend-watching in the conceptual design , and product evaluation for the design phase . 
UNKNOWN Alright I'm Heather and I've I said I'm your Project Manager , um Well you can pretty much read what it is that I'm doing . 
UNKNOWN But um um Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And uh tool training is one thing that we're going to be doing today , um um as well as planning the project , how we're going to , uh , create this product , and , um , discuss , um , our aims and objects of this , uh Which brings us to our next subject , is , um , um , as a team we're going to be designing and creating a new kind of remote control . 
UNKNOWN Um , we want this to be a marketable product that can be trendy , um , a completely new style , so that , um , can really appeal to a , to a generation that doesn't want a simple plain kind of , uh , channel-changer . 
UNKNOWN And , um , it needs to be user-friendly for , um , maybe , for an example , for people that , um , can't see the numbers as well , or , um , perhaps an ergonomic design . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So this is a television remote control ? 
UNKNOWN Yes , it's a television remote control . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN I believe I should be taking minuteson this right now . 
UNKNOWN So , alright . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um , the way that we're going to go about this is , um , we'll have a time where we can , um come up with new ideas alone , and , and work on the project and then , um , after we've brainstormed and , and thought about , we can come together in a meeting and , and discuss what , what um , what kind of functional design we want to use . 
UNKNOWN Same with conceptual design and detailed design . 
UNKNOWN So , um , making sure that it , it's usable , that as a , um and that it's , it's feasible to create , and uh , to come up with a concept of it want , what we want it to look like . 
UNKNOWN Um , tool training . 
UNKNOWN Is , is everyone , um Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Got those notes. 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
THANKS Thank you . 
CONFIRMATION Great . 
CONFIRMATION Great . 
UNKNOWN Um One thing that , uh , we're going to do is become more acquainted with the , the tools that we have access to for our project . 
UNKNOWN Um , one of them is our whiteboard . 
UNKNOWN And , um , as a sort of team-building moment , um , I , I'd like us to , um , try out the whiteboard by expressing our favourite animal and the charac characteristics of that animal . 
UNKNOWN Um , why that , why that should be your favourite animal . 
UNKNOWN So , um , I , I'm assuming that we should do that now . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN With our microphones still attached to our bodies . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Gosh . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN 'Kay , what's my favourite animal ? 
UNKNOWN Do come up . 
UNKNOWN Oh , to go first . 
UNKNOWN Oh , are we all doing it individually ? 
UNKNOWN This is a team-building time where , um , , okay cool , um My favourite animal , which changes all the time , okay , right now it is an elk . 
UNKNOWN Okay , let's stand up and support you Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN An elk ? 
UNKNOWN alright , so And it goes like Yeah it's got like big antlers , yeah . 
UNKNOWN A vicious We have sheep . 
UNKNOWN Looks kinda like , like it has holly growing out of its head . 
UNKNOWN Do you have elk where you come from ? 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN You do . 
UNKNOWN We have moose too . 
UNKNOWN Yeah we have moose and we have deer . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Do you have 'Kay , um . 
UNKNOWN Sheep . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , cows . 
UNKNOWN That's a great elk . 
UNKNOWN Uh-oh , we have a good artist . 
UNKNOWN That is really good . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I'm quite Very good . 
CONFIRMATION Thanks . 
UNKNOWN This is my Okay . 
UNKNOWN Oh , very shapely . 
UNKNOWN Brilliant . 
UNKNOWN That's a sketching of my my elk , and it , it is my favourite animal right now , 'cause it is a large beautiful majestic creature , that um , that um In a way it looks kind of awkward , because it's on spindly legs and it uh But it can really overcome harsh terrain , and although it's gorgeous it's also very dangerous , because it has um strong antlers , and uh it can really combat its enemies , even like it it's a it's an herbivore but , uh , it can really defend itself . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Very nice . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Right , I'm gonna take minuteswhile , um , you guys express your favourite animals . 
UNKNOWN Okay , I'll go next . 
UNKNOWN I am a big animal lover . 
UNKNOWN I like all sorts of animals , but for the moment I'm gonna drawa cat , in memory of my poor cat that died recently . 
SURPRISE Oh .
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN It's gonna be a bit of a strange drawing, but never mind . 
UNKNOWN Not as artistic as Heather's drawing. 
UNKNOWN Bit more cartoon style . 
UNKNOWN But I like cats because they're so independent , and they always seem to be doing what they want to be doing . 
UNKNOWN Um , but that doesn't mean they're completely not sociable , 'cause they enjoy interacting with humans as well , and they seem to enjoy the good things like sunshine and , um , running around outside as well as being inside , and enjoying their food , and generally just , they just seemed so cool and they just know what they're doing . 
UNKNOWN Uh I reckon they're sort of , they got it sorted . 
UNKNOWN They know what they want . 
UNKNOWN Basically , that's why I like cats . 
CONFIRMATION Great . 
UNKNOWN I'll rub that out . 
UNKNOWN There you go . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN I think my favourite animal would be a dog , but I'm not really sure how to drawone . 
UNKNOWN Ooh . 
UNKNOWN I , I've never drawn a dog , I don't think . 
UNKNOWN I'm tempted to drawa snail 'cause I drawthem sometimes and they're really easy to draw. 
UNKNOWN Um , right it's gonna be a really funny dog , 'cause I'm not sure how to drawa dog . 
UNKNOWN I forget her name . 
UNKNOWN Tara or Tara . 
UNKNOWN Well there are loads of different types of dogs , so I'm sure it'll represent one kind of dog . 
UNKNOWN It's a cartoon dog I think . 
UNKNOWN A s I don't ev Oh , oh well . 
UNKNOWN It's a scary cartoon dog . 
UNKNOWN That This , that does not look like a dog . 
UNKNOWN It looks kinda like a person . 
UNKNOWN I'm sorry . 
UNKNOWN We can pretend . 
UNKNOWN That's Pinocchio . 
UNKNOWN How do you drawa dog ? 
UNKNOWN I suppose it has a lon Oh my god . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Yous know what it's supposed to be . 
UNKNOWN It's a dog . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN . 
UNKNOWN Um , I like dogs because , um , they're so good to humans , like they can be trained to be police dogs and seeing-eye dogs , and they're just such friendly animals . 
UNKNOWN And , like they're more of a companion than cats . 
UNKNOWN I've nothing against cats . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's true . 
UNKNOWN Cats don't really like me , so I can't like them . 
UNKNOWN But they're just so friendly and warm and nice animals , that don't look like that . 
UNKNOWN Alrighty . 
UNKNOWN I feel like a robot . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um , well I guess I had the most time to think about it . 
UNKNOWN I'm going to drawa butterfly , because I saw a butterfly yesterday , that seemed to be like the symbol of Spring arriving . 
UNKNOWN And it was actually the prettiest butterfly I've ever seen out in the wild , and I though that was pretty cool in Scotland . 
UNKNOWN It was like , well it was a little pointier than that . 
UNKNOWN At first I thought it was a dead leaf . 
UNKNOWN And then it landed on the wall next to me . 
UNKNOWN But this part was all brown and then it has these big blue dots like this . 
UNKNOWN And then it kinda there was a green , I think it was a green ring , and there was like red going out like this . 
UNKNOWN It's kinda like a peacock . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , it kinda was actually , 'cause it was This part of the body was really dull , and then it was the most colourful exotic butterfly ever , and I'm like , wow this is the middle of Scotland in like March . 
UNKNOWN So I thought that was pretty cool . 
UNKNOWN And it landed by a wall and let me look at it for about two minutes . 
UNKNOWN I wish I'd had my camera . 
UNKNOWN So that's gonna be my favourite animal because after all the snow it seemed to say that like Spring is finally here . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN There you go . 
CONFIRMATION Very nice . 
CONFIRMATION Great . 
UNKNOWN Uh , what do we Oh . 
UNKNOWN Do you hear the eraser buzzing while you do that ? 
UNKNOWN Yes I do . 
UNKNOWN Yea Right . 
UNKNOWN So , now that we know how to use the whiteboard , um , the next , um , thing we need to address is our financial department , to meet our our budget , um or not meet our budget but more , um , like what kind of , uh , selling range we'll be looking at , um , wanna make this um selling price of twenty five Euros . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN And so we have to , um , come up with a way to , to create a , a uh remote control , where um we can like the price to create it will be significantly less . 
UNKNOWN Um , we'd like to , um to , uh , make fifty million Euro . 
UNKNOWN I'm assuming that's what the M_ means . 
UNKNOWN Um , and make it for an international market . 
UNKNOWN Um , one thing we'd have to think about internationally is in the design of , um , like different kinds of , uh , V_C_R_s . 
UNKNOWN Things like that , depending on which country you are . 
UNKNOWN Another thing for the design team to think about . 
UNKNOWN Um , we want it to cost , uh , absolute maximum of twelve Euro and fifty cents . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so we'll have a hundred percent profit then ? 
UNKNOWN Twelve fifty . 
UNKNOWN I'm bad at math . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN Um , so now that , um , that is underway , um it is discussion time . 
UNKNOWN So this is time for us to bring our initial ideas , any um suggestions that you may have so far , a um your personal experiences with remote controls , and um , um , areas you see that , uh , could be improved in your experience with them . 
UNKNOWN Does anyone have any initial thoughts ? 
UNKNOWN I find that in the dark it's often hard to know what button you're pushing . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So what's something we could , uh , do to remedy that ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN I always find that in our house the remote control always goes missing . 
UNKNOWN It's always , where is the remote control ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So maybe if you could have some kind of tracking device for the remote control or some signal that you could find out where it was . 
UNKNOWN I dunno , some kind of alarm . 
UNKNOWN You can press a button on your wall , signal , 'cause it always gets lost . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It's a great idea . 
UNKNOWN It's a great idea . 
UNKNOWN Do yous not find that , um , like , there's a lot of , um , buttons on your remote control , and you don't know what half of them do . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that you don't use half of them . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I don't know what they do . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN There's some remote controls where there's kind of a hidden panel , so all those buttons that you don't really use unless you're programming or something . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's , that's Yeah , it is . 
UNKNOWN That's useful . 
UNKNOWN So you just have like the number buttons , power button , T_V_ video button . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
UNKNOWN Anything about , um , the look of the , uh , remote control that you might have ideas about . 
UNKNOWN Maybe it could be , instead of like a standard rectangular shape , it could be , um , something more interesting like Any ideas will do that you have at this point . 
UNKNOWN Could be shaped like a conch , you know . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Be like a shell-shaped remote . 
UNKNOWN Can hold it . 
UNKNOWN A novelty . 
UNKNOWN Are we going into kind of novelty factors here . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Like , I've seen phones like a Okay . 
UNKNOWN Well if it's a trendy original , um , aspect we're going for . 
UNKNOWN I mean , you're the designers , you c , you can um decide what kind of , um , direction you wanna go in , but at this point in the , in the first meeting it can be any ideas that we just throw out there . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I suppose , if we're he heading to have it , like make a huge profit out of this , it needs to be quite a universally accepted thing . 
UNKNOWN Like , a novelty thing might only sell a few things rather than , like , a general kind of more acceptable But we don't wanna go towards boring , 'cause that wouldn't sell either . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So , hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And the key issue here is , is being trendy and original . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um , that does not necessarily mean it needs to be outrageous . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Okay we have five minutes left . 
UNKNOWN So , just to cover We have one more thing . 
UNKNOWN Um , like you can go over your ideas , of course , in your own personal times . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um , our next meeting will be in half an hour . 
UNKNOWN So you have half an hour to , uh , think about what you want to present . 
UNKNOWN Or not present but bring to the meeting . 
UNKNOWN Um , I_D_ , whatever that stands for . 
UNKNOWN . 
UNKNOWN Interface ? 
UNKNOWN Industrial Designer . 
UNKNOWN Industrial Designer . 
UNKNOWN Oh , industrial . 
UNKNOWN That's me . 
UNKNOWN I have to remember these things . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN You'll be beginning your , your working design . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um , U_I_D_ the technical functions design will , will be worked on the next thirty minutes . 
UNKNOWN Um , maybe how this can be achieved , and , um , we need the user requirements from the manag Marketing Expert . 
UNKNOWN Marketing Expert . 
UNKNOWN Um , you will get specific instructions , um , of what to do in the next half an hour . 
UNKNOWN And I'll see you in half an hour , okay ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
THANKS Thank you . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN That's okay . 
UNKNOWN That's okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Am I starting now ? 
UNKNOWN Anytime ? 
UNKNOWN Oh sorry . 
UNKNOWN 'Kay , um . 
UNKNOWN Alright , welcome back fro to the second meeting . 
UNKNOWN And um I hope you had a productive last thirty minutes . 
UNKNOWN Um , and um , I'll be taking minuteson this one , and um Being hooked up to the PowerPointfor this meeting isn't very necessary for uh myself , because it'll be more about uh , what you guys are bringing to the meeting today . 
UNKNOWN Um , so , the first presentationwe'll be looking at is Poppy's presentation. 
UNKNOWN And , um So , sorry ? 
UNKNOWN So , um , take it away Poppy . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um , do I need to plugged in . 
UNKNOWN It's , it's plugged in . 
UNKNOWN So , um No problem . 
UNKNOWN F_ eight , w . 
UNKNOWN Function F_ eight . 
UNKNOWN F_ okay . 
UNKNOWN Function F_ eight . 
UNKNOWN Sorry about this guys . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN is on . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN I will take this time just to apologise . 
UNKNOWN I , I only , uh , received my emails later on . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause I was too busy carried away doing my own thing , which is not obviously not a very good part of a team-working thing . 
UNKNOWN But there we go . 
UNKNOWN I'm sure it's fine . 
UNKNOWN Um , so I was looking at how we're going to go about the working design , and what we actually need to do , and what the remote control needs to do . 
UNKNOWN And it needs to um allow a person to have a portable desi device , so they can control the television from wherever they are . 
UNKNOWN They don't need to actually manually touch the television set . 
UNKNOWN So , it gives them much more flexibility , and allows them to be where they want to be . 
UNKNOWN Um , from Uh , on a functional side of things , we found out that wh from our previous meeting , we decided that there're certain points that will make our product unique . 
UNKNOWN Um , one is the visibility in the dark , which was um Genevieve's idea . 
UNKNOWN So we need to think about how we could bring this in um technically . 
UNKNOWN And we could use illuminated buttons , which we are all familiar with when we're using a mobile phone , or um something fam familiar . 
UNKNOWN A automatically , um lights up at first touch . 
UNKNOWN Or we could use fluorescent materials which would just um take in the light during the day , and then as soon as they go off they would glow in the dark . 
UNKNOWN Um , also we could use um an alarm . 
UNKNOWN So if we lost the um remote control , perhaps there could be a button on the television set itself , which you could press , and then an alarm from the handset would sound where it was , hopefully in the room . 
UNKNOWN Maybe behind a cushion or somewhere . 
UNKNOWN Um , so that would work . 
UNKNOWN Um , oop . 
UNKNOWN Go back there . 
UNKNOWN Um , another thing I think we d missed out on on the last meeting was the fact that we should consider the environmental impact of our design . 
UNKNOWN Um , from previous researches I've carried out on other projects , um we've learnt about smart materials where um um specific alloys of metals have a shape memory . 
UNKNOWN So they can be heated and um and cooled , and they change the shape of um the metal . 
UNKNOWN So , for example , a screw that's holding something together could expand and it would force all the components apart . 
UNKNOWN So um , the benefits of this for our product would be that when it came to the end of its product life , if it was heated , um everything would spring apart . 
UNKNOWN So , all the um individual components could be easily separated , and then some could be reused , some could be recycled , and I think that would be very important for products now . 
UNKNOWN Especially 'cause there's much uh responsibility for all the um companies who are coming up with like new designs. 
UNKNOWN 'Cause all , we all know that our resources are being limited , and we have to be very environmentally conscious . 
UNKNOWN Right , um , one question . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN This , um , self-destructible uh metal , it allows for recycling materials ? 
UNKNOWN Um And then Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So that , um , someone could have this product for as long as they felt that they wanted it , and then once they contribute it , then that company can break down the part , the parts better ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah they would , um you would make the , the product as you normally would , apart from the , the bits that hold it all together would be made out of this shape-memory alloy . 
UNKNOWN And that's the part that would um allow all the other parts to be separated at the end . 
UNKNOWN I mean , the user would return the p product to the company , 'cause it's the product's responsibility to get rid of what they've made . 
UNKNOWN Um , and then the company could then just use , make use of this shape-memory alloys to split up the components , and then either reuse some bits , and other bits which are obviously gonna wear out with time , or not usable , they might be like be able to put into scrap metal . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Something like the case , if it's scratched or something , you would want to reuse it , but you might be able to melt it down and reuse it again somewhere else . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Would we be the company that would break down these , or uh metals ? 
UNKNOWN Or would we contribute to another group ? 
UNKNOWN You could we could probably empl em employ a , a side company or something to do that for us . 
UNKNOWN But it would be our responsibility to get that done and to dispose of the products that we made . 
UNKNOWN For a certain percentage at least . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
UNKNOWN Not every , not a hundred percent of everything we produce , but Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN This sounds like a really great idea . 
UNKNOWN One thing we have to consider is our uh one hundred percent um turnover goal that we have for our financial sector . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um , so we'll have to investigate how much that will cost us , cost the company , um 'cause it sounds very labour-intensive . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN You would have to hire a number of people , and it might be more expensive . 
UNKNOWN Well I the fact of the shape-memory alloys is that they , they don't need to be manually de um deconstructed . 
UNKNOWN Like , you don't have to individually um unscrew all the screws . 
UNKNOWN Because of this , their properties are smart material . 
UNKNOWN All you need is just the heat , so they self-destruct themselves . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
UNKNOWN So I suppose it does need like high contact , yeah , you know high uh quality machinery , and very specific machinery , but Yeah . 
UNKNOWN We'll still have to investigate the financial implications . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
UNKNOWN I like the environmental approach . 
UNKNOWN Um , we'll have to see if that can meet our financial goals as well . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um also there is um components . 
UNKNOWN This'll be how it uh will actually work . 
UNKNOWN But I haven't put this plan together yet . 
UNKNOWN I'm sorry , could you Those were um Okay . 
UNKNOWN There we go . 
UNKNOWN Sorry , should I go back . 
UNKNOWN This would actually show the circuit diagram. 
UNKNOWN Although I haven't come up with the final circuit yet . 
UNKNOWN So I just put all those components in . 
UNKNOWN So those are what , um , we'll c construct the remote . 
UNKNOWN Those are all the Alright . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I it just shows what sort of energy source . 
UNKNOWN It could be a battery , like rechargeable probably . 
UNKNOWN Um , an' yeah , well how the infrared will actually be sent through the chip to be received by the chip on the television set itself . 
CONFIRMATION Great . 
UNKNOWN Okay ? 
UNKNOWN So , now is it F_ eight again to escape ? 
UNKNOWN Or escape ? 
UNKNOWN There we go . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
THANKS Thank you very much . 
THANKS Thank you . 
UNKNOWN And , um , the next presenter will be Tara . 
UNKNOWN There you go Tara . 
CONFIRMATION Thanks . 
UNKNOWN Can you see ? 
UNKNOWN Oh , Function F_ eight . 
UNKNOWN Do you think Is it uh , function eight yeah ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Function F_ eight . 
UNKNOWN Function F_ eight . 
UNKNOWN Sorry . 
UNKNOWN The one at the top . 
UNKNOWN Oh right . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN That looks right . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN I'm the User um User Interface Designer . 
UNKNOWN Uh , the technical functions design of the apparatus is the effect the apparatus should have . 
UNKNOWN Um , in this case it's the function of the remote control , which is to send messages to the television , television set . 
UNKNOWN By taking inspiration from other similar designs, we'll try and come up with an original trendy remote control , which is sellable international . 
UNKNOWN There're two functional design options . 
UNKNOWN A multifunctional remote control , which can be used for several entertainment devices . 
UNKNOWN And a single function remote control , used specifically for the television . 
UNKNOWN I'm sorry , what was that last one . 
UNKNOWN Multifunctional and Ch Oh , I see . 
UNKNOWN Sorry . 
UNKNOWN Um , a single function just for the television itself . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um , multifunctional controls can be difficult to use , as the multitude of buttons can be confusing . 
UNKNOWN A single function remote control is simpler to use , but it means you have to have other remote controls for your other entertainment devices . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN Um , I think that a single function remote control would be preferable , because it's easier to use . 
UNKNOWN It'd be more compatible with a range of television sets , making it more internationally sellable . 
UNKNOWN Um , it will make an original design more obtainable , as we have less functional necessities to include in the design . 
UNKNOWN And it would be more profitable as it would be more simplistic . 
UNKNOWN And less functions would have to be included . 
UNKNOWN So it would be cheaper to make . 
UNKNOWN And probably more sellable just because it's more compatible with a r a wider range of devices . 
UNKNOWN Does anyone have any questions ? 
UNKNOWN So as far as we know , um , a single function television remote control is us usable internationally ? 
UNKNOWN Well , it's just that , when we're creating it , we're , we have to make it um compatible with different brands of devices . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN And it would be easier to make it compatible with just different brands of television devices rather than other ent , yeah , other entertainment devices . 
UNKNOWN D_V_D_s and V_C_R_ ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Does everyone agree with this ? 
UNKNOWN Does anyone object and , and find the multifunctional might be a better way to go ? 
UNKNOWN Um , I was just wondering about the , what , what Genevieve said before , about having like some hidden controls like having the outer casing . 
UNKNOWN And that would probably , um , I d , well well what you said before about it being a more profitable simplistic design . 
UNKNOWN I suppose having that would complicate it a lot more . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And limit the design . 
UNKNOWN Do you think ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I think I agree with the single design thing for now , because we're trying to do so much , that if we're trying to make a unique , user-friendly , dadada , and it's also multi also multifunctional , um , we're gonna go over budget for one thing . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN That's true . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And with this we'll have more room in the budget probably to make a more original design . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN We'll have more money to go into the design side of it . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
UNKNOWN Sounds great . 
UNKNOWN Mm , 'kay . 
UNKNOWN Alright , well , um , are you ready for your presentationGenevieve ? 
UNKNOWN Yes I am . 
UNKNOWN Fabulous . 
UNKNOWN Except you're not hooked up to the Great . 
UNKNOWN Oh , I'm not hooked up , but other than that , completely ready . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN I just lost my microphone . 
UNKNOWN No problem , we can I'm sorry , what was that last thing that you just said ? 
UNKNOWN Just a moment . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So I'll be discussing the functional requirements of this remote control . 
UNKNOWN Um , and I'll give you a little briefing on what that means exactly . 
UNKNOWN Um , if you all remember from the emailwe got before our very first uh kick-off meeting , with the coffee machine ? 
UNKNOWN The functional requirements of that was to produce hot coffee quickly . 
UNKNOWN Um , so what I'll be talking about now is the equivalent for a remote control . 
UNKNOWN Um , so basically what needs and desires are to be fulfilled . 
UNKNOWN Um , I've done some marketing research , a lot of interviews with remote control users , um , and some internet research . 
UNKNOWN And I'll show you my findings . 
UNKNOWN Oh , and firstly I wanted to remind you about our company motto and purpose . 
UNKNOWN So we believe in providing international market with fashionable products . 
UNKNOWN Um , hence our motto , we put the fashion in electronics . 
UNKNOWN So I think that should be our priority here . 
UNKNOWN Um , and we should also be looking to trends in clothing and interior design . 
UNKNOWN Not just in electronic fashion . 
UNKNOWN So that it's something that fits in the household . 
UNKNOWN Um , we should be looking towards trends in both clothing and interior design . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Any trends that are going on in , in the public , even media , you know who's famous , what T_V_ shows are being watched , um , to influence our remote control . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so the findings . 
UNKNOWN Um , seventy five percent of users of remote controls find them ugly . 
UNKNOWN Which is a , quite a significant number . 
UNKNOWN Um , the other twenty five percent didn't specify if they love them or found them , you know , neutral . 
UNKNOWN Eighty percent of users would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy . 
UNKNOWN Current remote controls do not match well the operating behaviour of the user . 
UNKNOWN I'm sorry , that eighty percent of users would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy . 
UNKNOWN You mean that they would spend more money on a fancy-looking remote control ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , they're willing , they're willing to spend money on a remote control with personality . 
UNKNOWN As opposed to your basic , you know , oval black , all same size button remote control . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um , so it is something that people care about . 
UNKNOWN It's not , it's not ignored in the household . 
UNKNOWN Um , seventy five percent of remote control users said that they zap a lot . 
UNKNOWN Zapping meaning they go through channels a lot . 
UNKNOWN They're you know thumb-masters . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um , and fifty percent of users say they only use ten percent of the buttons . 
UNKNOWN That A very small amount . 
UNKNOWN Thought that was interesting . 
UNKNOWN Alright , so it might be very appealing if , um , we have very concise buttons . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN the single function . 
UNKNOWN And another thing with um lots of surfing , we'd probably have to work on something that could be um a lot more durable , because I find with um channel-changers that , um , a lot of the numbers get rubbed down if they're printed on the button . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah that's a good point . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And actually to go with that , I'm gonna give you some statistics on the uh relevancy of the buttons , how much they're used . 
UNKNOWN And uh how important the uh users find them . 
UNKNOWN So the power button , obviously , in an hour is only used once . 
UNKNOWN Hopefully the person's not turning on and off the T_V_ . 
UNKNOWN Um , but the relevance of that button is nine out of ten . 
UNKNOWN So people wanna be able to turn on the T_V_ with the remote control . 
UNKNOWN Um , as opposed to standing up and turning on the television set . 
UNKNOWN Channel selection is used a hundred and sixty eight times on average per hour . 
UNKNOWN That's a huge amount . 
UNKNOWN This is the most important button . 
UNKNOWN Um , so obviously when commercials come on they're changing it , so as you said we want a durable button that's not gonna run down . 
UNKNOWN Relevance of that button , our users found was uh ten , ten out of ten . 
UNKNOWN Uh , ditto for volume selection , so ten out of ten . 
UNKNOWN And it's used on average four times an hour . 
UNKNOWN Not as much as channel selection , but still significant . 
UNKNOWN Um , audio settings is used on average zero point eight times an hour . 
UNKNOWN Relevance is two . 
UNKNOWN Screen settings , which means brightness , colour etcetera , zero point five times an hour . 
UNKNOWN Um , and relevance of one point five . 
UNKNOWN We're getting to specific statistics here . 
UNKNOWN Teletext , um , now I'm not too clear on what that is . 
UNKNOWN I don't know if you can help me . 
UNKNOWN Flipping pages. 
UNKNOWN Is that So like a running banner , underneath Oh . 
UNKNOWN It's um It has T_V_ has like information , it has information on holidays , the news , entertainment . 
UNKNOWN It's like the news . 
UNKNOWN Or like information . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN The and what's on . 
UNKNOWN It's um No it's a button that you press , and then you , uh , like a menu pops up . 
UNKNOWN No , li Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I haven't used it before but Mm . 
UNKNOWN And you have pagenumbers like for the menu , and you press the pagenumbers with your remote , and it , it'll come up . 
UNKNOWN It's like It's like very basic internet . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Very basic internet , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Sort of , um Yeah , it's just information that um , like television timetables , what's on , what's on now , what's on next , on every channel , and Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN But you have Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Like tells you the weather , and Okay . 
UNKNOWN But you have no interaction back with it , you know . 
UNKNOWN Like the internet you can send emails and You've no interaction . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
UNKNOWN Well I guess I'm not with it , because I wasn't But it's , it's being used fourteen times an hour . 
UNKNOWN Um , and has a r a high relevance of six point five . 
UNKNOWN So it looks like something that we're gonna want to do some research on and include on our remote control . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um , channel settings . 
UNKNOWN Zero point zero one times an hour . 
UNKNOWN Relevance of three . 
UNKNOWN Channel settings . 
UNKNOWN Uh , probably just tuning in the channels , would it be ? 
UNKNOWN P Sorry . 
UNKNOWN Changing the channels ? 
UNKNOWN Tuning them in at the very start . 
UNKNOWN You know if you get a new T_V_ set , you tune in all the channels , do you th do you think ? 
CONFIRMATION Oh , okay . 
UNKNOWN To get the right reception and picture , I suppose . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um , so it's not used very often , but people still find it relevant . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um , biggest frustrations of uh the people that we interviewed . 
UNKNOWN Remote controls are often lost somewhere . 
UNKNOWN So that was already discussed by Poppy . 
UNKNOWN How we could have a , an alarm system so that people can find it . 
UNKNOWN Um , takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote control . 
UNKNOWN So it should be very user-friendly , you know . 
UNKNOWN People know what to do very quickly . 
UNKNOWN Um , remote controls are bad for R_S_I_ . 
UNKNOWN Repetitive strain injury . 
UNKNOWN Repeti Uh . 
UNKNOWN Ah . 
UNKNOWN I think . 
UNKNOWN Is that what it is ? 
UNKNOWN People with arthritis and such ? 
UNKNOWN That's rather sad . 
UNKNOWN Um , maybe our designers can look into that . 
UNKNOWN Oh , I'm guessing that's what it is . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah . 
UNKNOWN I'm not Mm . 
UNKNOWN I think it is . 
UNKNOWN Um , buttons that don't require , you know , very firm pushing , if they respond . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But we'll have to also avoid , you know , buttons responding to the slightest touch as well . 
UNKNOWN That's a problem . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It is . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Did you guys uh get that one down ? 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN Um okay , here's some ideas for you . 
UNKNOWN A large percentage of the public would pay for voice recognition on the remote controls . 
UNKNOWN So I'll show you some numbers here . 
UNKNOWN Um , so the youngest age group , fifteen to twenty five . 
UNKNOWN Ninety one point two percent said that they would pay extra money to have voice recogni voice recognition included on their remote control . 
UNKNOWN Um , and you can see that number decreases a bit with ol s Interestingly enough , twenty five to thirty five is the lowest amount . 
UNKNOWN Um , that would , are willing to pay extra . 
UNKNOWN So I guess we're gonna have to figure out what age group we're , we're targeting , and if and if voice recognition is something we wanna look into . 
UNKNOWN And if we have the budget for it . 
UNKNOWN Um , if we are targeting young adults , it looks like something that would pay off . 
UNKNOWN Seeing as ninety percent , over ninety percent would pay for it . 
UNKNOWN I agree with um if we're targeting young adults then it would be something we should look into . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um , financially and and functionally . 
UNKNOWN Um , and especially if we are um trying to be trendy , go with fashions , things like that . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Um , ages like from thirty five to sixty five which show lower numbers probably won't be as concerned . 
UNKNOWN So that , that's a whole other field of research . 
UNKNOWN I don't know if it'd be , if we'd still have a remote , or if you're talking to your television and saying change channel . 
UNKNOWN Um and depending on how many members you have in households . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So it m it may be too complicated for us , but it's something to keep in mind anyway . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And something that might further complicate it is that the T_V_ makes noise itself . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Wonder if it would have Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And if there was conversation in the room at the same time , although in theory it doesn't tend to be when you're watching television , but could be very difficult to get the specific uh design . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN If we're looking for a simplistic design , if We need to decide if that is our um intention is , is a simplistic design . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Um , because if , if it is then I think voice , um voice-activated Yeah , and that would sort of negate the whole remote control thing , because if people can activate the television with their voice then they won't be using a , they won't be talking into a remote , I'm sure . 
UNKNOWN It looks like Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN It'd be like the ultimate remote . 
UNKNOWN Um okay . 
UNKNOWN And th the last thing here was a , an L_C_D_ screen . 
UNKNOWN So , I mean voice recognition might be a little too extreme for us . 
UNKNOWN Not practical . 
UNKNOWN Um an L_C_D_ screen though might be something that , you know , you can shift through pageskind of li the way this PowerPointis working . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So that you don't have so many buttons to deal with . 
UNKNOWN Um , I don't know what an L_C_D_ screen is . 
UNKNOWN Oh sorry , just , just a screen , like a computer screen . 
UNKNOWN S Or like um Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Mobile phone . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Or Like an alarm clock . 
UNKNOWN You'd have an L_C_D_ versus just a , a normal clock . 
UNKNOWN What , what would appear on the screen ? 
UNKNOWN I have no idea still . 
UNKNOWN I'm sorry . 
UNKNOWN Oh just like an electronic screen . 
UNKNOWN As opposed to just buttons . 
UNKNOWN There would be like a little , like on Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Oh , on the remote . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Like on the top of a cellphone , the the little L_C_D_ screen . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um , now that's , I , I dunno exactly what exactly we'd put on there . 
UNKNOWN I guess the channel that you're on , the v the volume setting . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Could it it It would be good if it had the actual programme that was on , and what was next . 
UNKNOWN But that would probably be Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Like linked in with the teletext , or sort of like an teletext at your fingers , without having to access that through the television . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN That would be good , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Might be quite expensive to do that though . 
UNKNOWN Mm , Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Could be . 
UNKNOWN Well I guess that's something we can all take back to our respective research . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um , and finally , whoops , my personal preferences and thoughts . 
UNKNOWN Um , I think our priority really should be unique design . 
UNKNOWN Um , we want something that people want in their home . 
UNKNOWN Every remote control looks the same , so uh in my opinion it should be , um , user-friendly and unique . 
UNKNOWN So the other stuff might be a little too , a little too gadgety for some people . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um , I th myself , voice recognition kind of scares me off . 
UNKNOWN So if we're , if we're aiming to make this an international university , universally accepted product Um , and for all , the other thing is like age market . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN I mean if we wanted to concentrate on fifteen to twenty five years olds , we could go for the fancy stuff . 
UNKNOWN But if we wanna make fifty million , and and have everyone want this remote control , we should maybe stick to the basics . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN And we should keep in mind that fifteen to twenty five year olds might not have twenty five Euros to spend on a remote control . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Like their priorities might not be a fancy remote control , when they're just starting out and , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN And we have to keep in mind the , the reliability of our research . 
UNKNOWN I mean , you know , a sixteen year old boy would say , yeah I'd pay extra for voice recognition , until they realise that's three months allowance . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um , so I I think , I think the older generations we should be catering to a bit more . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Early twenties , that's the kind of age group . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And if one of the largest , uh , or most complained about thing is that it takes so long to get to know how to use a remote control , I'm sure that something like an L_C_D_ screen or remote control would be just furthering that problem . 
UNKNOWN Twenties . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN Complicated jus complicating things even fo Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN That's it for the market research . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Before we go into uh more discussion on we want this design to look like , I've received some information from the management that will affect some of our decisions . 
UNKNOWN Um , for one thing , because Having controls with D_V_D_ , V_C_R_ , that sort of thing , would really complicate the design of the remote control . 
UNKNOWN Um , we've decided not to include them and make it a specific , just a specific television um function . 
UNKNOWN Which is good as , as we've sort of decided that we would like to go with that anyway . 
UNKNOWN Um , for many reasons . 
UNKNOWN So um we have that decision sort of made for us . 
UNKNOWN Another thing that might um affect other decisions is that um the management feels that teletext is outdated , because more people are using the internet now . 
UNKNOWN And so uh we won't concern ourselves with um navigating the teletext option . 
UNKNOWN Can I just interrupt ? 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN Would you like to plug in your Have you got a PowerPointor not ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Maybe we can do the There you go . 
UNKNOWN Okay , sure . 
UNKNOWN Yeah I do . 
UNKNOWN I'm looking at looking at it right now . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Thanks . 
THANKS Thank you . 
UNKNOWN Oh , come back screen . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Were they , was the management suggesting use of the internet rather than teletext , or just avoiding both altogether ? 
UNKNOWN Um , well , I mean we don't have the resources or or possibility of using the internet with the remote control , but um they were just pretty much saying that the teletext would not be used . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Alright , and another thing . 
UNKNOWN This is for the design , the design of the product is that um we wanna create , um more of a sense that people know that this is from our company . 
UNKNOWN So , um , all the remote controls must have our um We'll incorporate our logo and colour in in some way . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So , um , perhaps um our logo on the bottom , or wherever you feel like it would look good . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um , it doesn't have to be the colour of our um of our company but , another thing is that , um we need to , we probably would have to have that colour and , and logo decided upon . 
UNKNOWN Just Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um , I'm assuming that we already have one , but for the purposes of this meeting I , I wasn't offered a , like a type of logo or colour , so if that could be um somewhere on the design so that we can be recognisable . 
UNKNOWN Work on that . 
UNKNOWN It's probably R_ R_R_ in yellow . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN The little R_ R_ yellow thing ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I think . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Real Reaction ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um , yes , those are the changes . 
UNKNOWN Um , so , now we need to discuss , um and come to a decision on our remote control functions , of , of how this is going to be . 
UNKNOWN I'm just going to look at my notesfor a second . 
UNKNOWN Um , we have to decide on a target group and the functions of the remote control . 
UNKNOWN So , um , we already know that it'll just be for the television . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN It'll It won't have teletext . 
UNKNOWN But um , you know , we could discuss um those other options that you brought up , Genevieve . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so I Are we going to write off the L_C_D_ option ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Is that how most people feel about that ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So no L_C_D_ , no teletext , and no voice recognition . 
UNKNOWN I think it would be annoying though if I don't use teletext that much , but if it was on your T_V_ , you'd want to be able to use it , if You'd Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but another thing is that if we're reaching an international crowd , um , I know for one that in North America there is no such thing as teletext , so it'd be really superfluous . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So is it just Okay . 
UNKNOWN Never heard of it . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN I don't know about other countries besides the U_K_ . 
UNKNOWN Do you know if anywhere else has it ? 
UNKNOWN I don't know . 
UNKNOWN I don't know . 
UNKNOWN I don't know . 
UNKNOWN More research required , I think . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
UNKNOWN But if Was it a management decision that we're having Okay . 
UNKNOWN It was a management decision , so it's , it's pretty much out of our hands at this point . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So Okay . 
UNKNOWN Okay then . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN So , I guess we're looking at something rather simple . 
UNKNOWN Um , well I guess , just from my findings it looks like we wanna minimise buttons . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Minimal Yeah okay . 
UNKNOWN And the What was the word they used ? 
UNKNOWN F findability is important . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think we should definitely go ahead with the alarm system idea that you had . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause I'm sure that could be inex inexpensive because we could use the same kind of infrared the same signal through that and it could just like make a little beeping noise . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN The same signalling . 
UNKNOWN I mean Or vibrate just the same as a mobile phone . 
UNKNOWN It's not that expensive to do . 
UNKNOWN Like you just a , a buzz or something . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN I like that idea . 
UNKNOWN Would you be able to , um , put the little device anywhere ? 
UNKNOWN 'Cause uh isn't our remote control for all T_V_s , so you'd ha Yeah , with the button that you pressed . 
UNKNOWN If Do you mean the the link between the Well , if the button was actually on Oh , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN The button Oh . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN C 'cause then it would only be a applicable to one T_V_ set , so it would need to be something that you could stick somewhere , or something . 
UNKNOWN Minor detail there . 
UNKNOWN Maybe Yeah , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Maybe something adhesive that you could like stick onto the back of any set that would be um yeah not very obtrusive . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , it would have t Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Obviously something small that's Yeah , that's a good point . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Then it wouldn't , it probably wouldn't be able to use It would be able to use the same reception on the remote c control I guess , but the actual device would have to have its own infrared signaller . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , okay . 
UNKNOWN Would it need a battery then ? 
UNKNOWN Maybe , um Probably , I mean . 
UNKNOWN Pr probably . 
UNKNOWN Unless it could be Okay . 
UNKNOWN That's your department you'll have to sort that out . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Um , unless some way , it could have some universal connection to like the socket , the same socket that the T_V_'s supplied from . 
UNKNOWN I mean the power for the T_V_ . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So , mm , more research into that one . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , you'll have to Yeah , you'll have to investi Do some research on that , alright ? 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Great . 
UNKNOWN Um , alright , and I'm sure that , um um , the glow-in-the-dark , fluorescent , whatever , system , um is a go ahead . 
UNKNOWN Is everyone interested in that ? 
UNKNOWN Y Yeah . 
UNKNOWN On the buttons ? 
UNKNOWN I I like the light up suggestion . 
UNKNOWN I think that would be better . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause you know the way fluorescent lights lose their brightness after certain time , so I would go for Well just the numbers could be embossed , couldn't it ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN it doesn't It could it could be a tactile thing as well . 
UNKNOWN Um right , if w if we're minimising buttons , we might be able to make them actually larger . 
UNKNOWN And there's something on it . 
UNKNOWN S you know like up arrow down arrow for , for volume . 
UNKNOWN Like a raised Yeah That's true . 
UNKNOWN Um , and I don't know what we could do for , for channels . 
UNKNOWN S The numbers themselves . 
UNKNOWN Like raised . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But then the like up button and down button for the channel , channel changing . 
UNKNOWN Could be raised . 
UNKNOWN Just little arrows , that you could feel , maybe ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN I just thought that it , it might be sucking more battery power , if there , if it is a light up . 
UNKNOWN I'm not sure . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And also y , uh Heather you mentioned before , um like how it should be accessible to everybody . 
UNKNOWN But I mean Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um , so like big b um buttons , for people you are visually impaired . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN The glow-in-the-dark or light up won't make any difference anyway . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So like you say tactile might be better , because it'd be more available to everybody . 
UNKNOWN That , I think that's good , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Could we somehow We could , may , possibly , sorry , incorporate them both so that the buttons could maybe be in the shape of the numbers themselves and be made out of some glow-in-the-dark material . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause I d I don't think that glow-in-the-dark material , um , like the actual soft plastic , um , costs that much more than other colours . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN No , I wouldn't say so . 
UNKNOWN No , it's not these days . 
UNKNOWN I mean , it's quite easily accessible . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I guess the other option , referring to the battery thing is , you know how cellphones will t light up for fifteen seconds or something , when you're s and then it goes , so if , if you're like changing the volume during a movie . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN That's good Yeah that a good idea . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I know , I'm thinking of mostly when you're watching a movie you turn all the lights off right . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And you don't want to turn on the lights , to turn it down , because there's suddenly an explosion , and it's gonna wake up the baby . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um , so if you touch the button , it kind of reactivates it . 
UNKNOWN It lights up for On self timer . 
UNKNOWN That , yeah , that's a good idea . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So self-timed lighting . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Alright we have five minutes left um , for the meeting , but I think we should discuss this light subject a little bit more before we close . 
UNKNOWN Um , I Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um , what was I missed the last moment , reading that . 
UNKNOWN What were you talking about with the lighting up buttons ? 
UNKNOWN Oh , just if it was kinda the same way that a cell You know how a cellphone will light up for about ten , fifteen seconds when you touch a button , after having not touched it for a while . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um , if instead of a constant light up on the , on the remote control , if it lights up for ten seconds when it's touched again . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN So it could be any button that would be pressed . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , and you , you touch it and it just kind of lights up a bit , and it gives a faint glow . 
UNKNOWN So , self-timed Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So if you have all the lights off in your living room , you'll , you'll temporarily see it . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Because usually you're not fooling around for it for more than what ten seconds . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so That's probably feasible . 
UNKNOWN So Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So , do you think that we should do the lighting up thing , and the glow-in-the-dark thing , and the shape of the numbers ? 
UNKNOWN Do we have to kind of decide what we're gonna do with this . 
UNKNOWN I think the shape of the numbers is a really good idea . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , okay . 
UNKNOWN And I think that's un unique as well . 
UNKNOWN For visually impaired , yeah . 
UNKNOWN I mean , I haven't seen that . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN And as you're saying like numbers can wear off if they're just sort of like painted on , you know printed . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah . 
UNKNOWN And it could , if it's that softer rubber material it'll be , maybe , um , uh , better for people with um els no what's it called , R_S_I_ , what was it that we were talking about ? 
UNKNOWN durable . 
UNKNOWN Oh yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Oh right , the Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Repetitive strain injury . 
UNKNOWN Yeah instead of like hard buttons . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um , did we want to go for the glow-in-the-dark look ? 
UNKNOWN Or did we want to go for the lighting up instantly ? 
UNKNOWN If I was thinking though , if it was glow-in-the-dark , you could put the um Real Reaction symbol as glow-in-the-dark , and then it would be constantly advertised . 
UNKNOWN Like should we do both ? 
UNKNOWN Or we can have one or the other ? 
UNKNOWN Because it might , for , for our design purposes , I mean , the lighting up thing might be better because glow-in-the-dark material has a funny kinda colour . 
UNKNOWN I was gonna say , Exactly . 
UNKNOWN And it might not go with different like face plates that we might come up with . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It the it might be perceived as tacky , glow-in-the-dark . 
UNKNOWN It's kind of like Eighties neon-style . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , and we could Yeah there are now like loads , or a huge range of different colours that it could light up in as well , which could like link in with the company colours . 
UNKNOWN Um , whereas we're trying to be trendy and fashionable . 
UNKNOWN So Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Like it could be blue or green or yellow , or like we've just limited t with the , just ordinary phosphorescent so Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
CONFIRMATION Right .
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
UNKNOWN So we've decided on lighting up things . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Every time the , that it lit up , you c that could light up as well . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Or , or the , whate Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But with the same thing , I mean . 
UNKNOWN That's true . 
UNKNOWN If you touch the button and then it could be , it could be lit up as well . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Is Are you okay with that ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Cool . 
UNKNOWN Um Alright . 
UNKNOWN So I think that um that completes most of our um our more uh practical decisions . 
UNKNOWN Is Okay . 
UNKNOWN And now it's up to designing . 
UNKNOWN And um making sure that this can be feasible . 
UNKNOWN What um Oh sorry . 
UNKNOWN And do you have anything Do you have anything to say ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah well , I was just gonna throw out there the thought about um personalising the remote control . 
UNKNOWN Um , it , you , 'cause you mentioned face plates . 
UNKNOWN So I I dunno if there's something that diff , you know like five different face plates . 
UNKNOWN I dunno if this will start making it more complicated , but it could increase the popularity of the , of the remote . 
UNKNOWN Oh yeah . 
UNKNOWN Like you can have changeable um mobile covers or something . 
UNKNOWN Um Yeah , Exactly , like an iPod . 
UNKNOWN Interchangeable thing ? 
UNKNOWN Like an iPod or something ? 
UNKNOWN That would be good . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , or Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Exactly . 
UNKNOWN Or , or like mobile ph . 
UNKNOWN Like a cellphone ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And I dunno if we'd want to go with like T_V_ show themes or something . 
UNKNOWN Like a Bart Simpson faceplate . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , and then that would be uh more profitable like as a sideline to the remote as well . 
UNKNOWN But Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Y Could buy extra Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Accessories . 
UNKNOWN Exactly . 
UNKNOWN You could start out with three , and if , if we hit it big then we can add some on . 
UNKNOWN Person Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well , that's great . 
UNKNOWN That's a good idea . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think that we should incorporate that . 
UNKNOWN Interchangeable . 
UNKNOWN Um , als Yeah . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause that wouldn't be very expensive at all . 
UNKNOWN You'd just get one mould , throw some plastic in it , you know . 
NEGATION No . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Interchan And also possible I mean , uh , we could gain out of that by advertising certain T_V_ shows , or Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Oh yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well , that might be com problematic with um copyright issues . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN So , if it takes off then we'll , we'll , we'll try that out . 
UNKNOWN But if we , there is Yeah . 
UNKNOWN If w No . 
UNKNOWN We could Um , the environmental factor , we didn't bring that up again . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN We'll have to do more research . 
UNKNOWN Like as of yet , that has nothing to do with , um , the way it'll look . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um , does it need to be reached a de Do we need to reach a decision on that right now ? 
UNKNOWN Um , I've Okay . 
UNKNOWN Because we need to investigate the financial implications . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Let's I think we could probably leave that 'til later on , then . 
UNKNOWN Is it Does it need to be uh decided on now ? 
UNKNOWN Or should we Okay . 
UNKNOWN Good . 
UNKNOWN Alright then . 
UNKNOWN Anyone else have anything more to say before we close ? 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN Alright , well . 
UNKNOWN Let's have lunch and we'll discuss this later . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Alright ? 
THANKS Thank you . 
UNKNOWN Is everyone ready to start ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Great . 
UNKNOWN Well , welcome to the third meeting of conceptual design . 
UNKNOWN I'll just get the PowerPointpresentationup and running . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um , on the agendafor this , um , for this particular meeting , we'll have your three presentationson what you've done since our last meeting , after we came up with um some general ideas of our design . 
UNKNOWN And , um , then we have to make some key decisions on , on our remote control concept , and how we're gonna make it , what uh materials we're gonna use , and that sort of thing . 
UNKNOWN The meeting will be forty minutes long . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN And um we will once again have Poppy as our first presenter . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Alright , and I will switch up PowerPoint. 
THANKS Thank you . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Should be just loading . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Oh , although I can't see it on my screen . 
UNKNOWN That says go here . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN I've been doing some research into the different components that we could use , um what's available to us f to actually make the remote control . 
UNKNOWN Um , first of all we have to look at how the remote control is actually made , and what is it happens inside the casing , which is more your field . 
UNKNOWN Um , thes main internal feature is a circuit board , which contains all the elec electronics and also the contacts with the power source . 
UNKNOWN Which is not necessarily a battery , as we're about to see . 
UNKNOWN Um , there are several components of , um , the circuit board that we need to consider , where we'll be getting them from , what they'll be made of . 
UNKNOWN Um , including the integrated circuit , which is also known as the chip . 
UNKNOWN Which is where all the main information is uh contained . 
UNKNOWN Um , diodes , transistors , resonators , resistors , and capacit capacitors all need to be considered as well . 
UNKNOWN Um , and all their positioning in the circuit . 
UNKNOWN Um Are they all included , like mandatorily , or r are these different options ? 
UNKNOWN Uh , these , they're all different options , they're all separate , apart from the chip , which we will probable decide whether we buy a simple , a regular , advanced . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN We can go into that later . 
UNKNOWN Um , all the other things are individual components that we'd have to get in separately , and work out the most , like , effective um circuit , including all the wires and everything like that . 
UNKNOWN And the L_E_D_ of course , that's a light emitting diode . 
UNKNOWN So , we could , so we've got flex flexibility with colours and things , with that as well . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Okay , there are lots of different possibilities for the energy source . 
UNKNOWN We could use a basic battery , but that brings with it , like they need to be recharged and the bulk , the size of it as well . 
UNKNOWN And they're not so great to dispose of , environmentally . 
UNKNOWN There's a hand-powered dynamo which is a sort of thing that was used for torches fifty years ago . 
UNKNOWN A bit out of date . 
UNKNOWN Kinetic energy is something that's been recently developed . 
UNKNOWN Um What is a hand-powered dynamo ? 
UNKNOWN Um , where you manually charge up the power . 
UNKNOWN Like you wind up something . 
UNKNOWN Just every , every once in a while ? 
CONFUSION Sorry ? 
UNKNOWN Just every once in a while or constantly ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Every once in a while I think . 
UNKNOWN But it's Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
UNKNOWN It'd be kind of strange to always be cranking it I think . 
UNKNOWN It would be like going a step back in time . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I don't think it would really be with kind of cutting edge technology . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN Whereas kinetic energy is a new idea that's being used by some watches and other devices , where you just shake the device and it gives it power . 
UNKNOWN I mean , the kinetic energy is transformed into power to make the circuit work . 
UNKNOWN Um , or there's solar power , which we've been considering inside a building , which is where it's gonna be used , might not be quite so useful . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN But , good to look into , renewable energy , always the way . 
UNKNOWN Um , lots of considerations for the case , like what sort of shape it would be , curved or flat . 
UNKNOWN That's got a lot to do with the ergonomics . 
UNKNOWN Like how it's comfortable and s sits in the hand . 
UNKNOWN We don't want something that's huge and you can't pick up . 
UNKNOWN Or too small . 
UNKNOWN Or too slidy . 
UNKNOWN I know I've had a remote control before which you couldn't tell which was the front and the back , 'cause it had so many buttons on , and the shape was so symmetrical that I'd be pressing like a volume button instead of the on button . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Because you can't really see which way round it is . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Um , we also can choose what materials um , the we could use metal , we could use rubber which might be more um ideal for the anti-R_S_I_ . 
UNKNOWN It's like the same sort of rubber that's used in stress balls and things like that , so it's very like soft , not so stressful on your hands . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Wood . 
UNKNOWN Um , again , stepping back in time again there . 
UNKNOWN I don't think that's quite up to date with what we're looking for here . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um , titanium is not gonna be possible , even though it just it beyond our budget really . 
UNKNOWN But , would've been maybe for future projects . 
UNKNOWN Um right our choice for buttons as well . 
UNKNOWN We've developed some we've got some good advances in technology , with our research team have found some uh new multiple um option scroll buttons . 
UNKNOWN I think that was brought up for , um , they're basically quite a flexible design , modern , you don't have to use individual buttons . 
UNKNOWN You can just slideup and down . 
UNKNOWN I'm sure we're all quite familiar with those on mobiles or computer laptop pads . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um one thing with the scroll buttons though . 
UNKNOWN It , it we would have to have an L_C_D_ um display , and the glow in the dark thing might be difficult . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN That's true . 
UNKNOWN And that would lead to an advanced yeah . 
UNKNOWN If we have yeah . 
UNKNOWN We're going on to that later with the advanc with the L_C_D_ that means we'd need a really advanced chip . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And it's unlikely that that's gonna be in our budget . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um , also we've got the integrated pushbutton , which is what we're most familiar with . 
UNKNOWN It's the most straightforward . 
UNKNOWN But you can in like incorporate that with a scroll button as well . 
UNKNOWN . 
UNKNOWN Got decisions to make there . 
UNKNOWN And this is what I was just saying before . 
UNKNOWN Linked in the different depends on what type of buttons we have and the inputs . 
UNKNOWN Um simple would go with the pushbutton . 
UNKNOWN Um , regular you could link with the scroll button . 
UNKNOWN And the advanced we'd have to go with a L_C_D_ s display . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN My personal preferences ? 
UNKNOWN I think we could go for the kinetic energy source . 
UNKNOWN I don't , I think that's quite um an advanced kind of technology . 
UNKNOWN It's not been seen before , so it could be quite a , a novelty factor , attractive as well . 
UNKNOWN And also energy saving 'cause you're producing the energy , you don't need an external sort of battery supply or solar panels . 
UNKNOWN You just give it a shake . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Sounds brilliant to me . 
UNKNOWN Rubber casing I thing would probably the best , if we're going for the anti-R_S_I_ and like more choice with um aesthetics . 
CONFUSION Uh . 
UNKNOWN Like it could be pretty much any colour we want . 
UNKNOWN Um , and gives you , yeah , more flexibility there . 
UNKNOWN And probably the regular chip as opposed to the simple , then we could possibly have the scroll and the push , but no L_C_D_ , 'cause we probably can't afford that one . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um , one concern with the rubber casing is that it would be rubber encapsulating all of these chips and diodes and delicate technology as like as the exterior . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN This is the one thing that's protecting its innards . 
UNKNOWN I think that would , uh there would be an in sort of more internal casing . 
UNKNOWN And the rubber would just be the , what's in contact with the human . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Another thing is it might be more difficult if it's a rubber exterior talking about putting on interchangeable plates . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um , is it I don't see how a like a rubber plate going on top it would stay there . 
UNKNOWN Like if it was sort of like a clip-on plastic plate . 
UNKNOWN It would work that way . 
UNKNOWN Maybe if the , um , if it was just kind of a , more of a rubber coating which was on to a case . 
UNKNOWN W Like plastic with rubber , kind of on top Well , there's , there is a certain phone that has like a rubber casing , b like a Nokia it is . 
UNKNOWN So , it was kind of , the whole thing would be removable . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Like I can't think of what . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Or like an you can get sort of outer casing for iPods and something , that's just it's protective as well . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN It's yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Like the skin ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It , it stops it , I mean , it would reduce the impact if it was dropped or something , as well , 'cause it wouldn't damage itself so easily . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
UNKNOWN I think i maybe a mixture of both there , maybe . 
UNKNOWN So maybe the Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So the actual remote would be hard plastic and the casings rubber . 
UNKNOWN And then yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN And the buttons obviously are rubber . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN That sounds good . 
UNKNOWN I , um , is it possible to put designsonto this type of rubber ? 
UNKNOWN As far as I know . 
UNKNOWN It should be . 
UNKNOWN Okay , we'll just say yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yes , just why not . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
UNKNOWN I like the kinetic energy source idea . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I thought that was Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um , I don't know when people will , um , be moving a remote around a lot . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , tha Backup . 
UNKNOWN But I think that it's worth it , kinetety , kinetic um energy source . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN It could make an we could have any kind of style . 
UNKNOWN It wouldn't be as heavy or bulky , and Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Just for environmental reasons . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I guess it's a bit scary 'cause it hasn't been done before . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So it seems we'd have to do more research on it . 
UNKNOWN Or I dunno if you could have a battery pack . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Like as a backup for something . 
UNKNOWN Yeah so there's there is a one battery , because most remotes use two batteries I believe . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So , if it was running off of one battery as a Right . 
UNKNOWN That would be good yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Some alternative just in case something went wrong . 
UNKNOWN Maybe we could you were saying about um solar power ma maybe not working indoors , but a lot of calculators , yeah , have solar power . 
UNKNOWN That's true . 
UNKNOWN I just thought of that . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So maybe that could be incorporated as Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN May maybe that could be the backup . 
UNKNOWN Instead of a battery . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Although it needs some light , doesn't it ? 
UNKNOWN Like solar backup . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Do , do those calculators yeah . 
UNKNOWN I suppose s but some But thing is , it's not you don't need the solar all the time . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , you can watch a T_V_ in the dark then . 
UNKNOWN So , if we're doing yeah . 
UNKNOWN If we're Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I don't know how it works . 
UNKNOWN It can be stored . 
UNKNOWN It can be like you can have the solar energy and then it can store that energy and use it . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It just needs to be in light for a certain amount of time per day . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Like a few hours a day . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think that might be a little impractical though . 
UNKNOWN . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think sometimes it's just shoved under , under a cushion , and yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN That's true . 
UNKNOWN It could easily Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Like people don't wanna have to worry about that . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I suppose it would be really annoying if you get to think , oh no , I forgot to charge my remote today . 
UNKNOWN Like if the kinetic thing , I think what's best about that is that it's instant energy . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN You don't have to , you know , you can shake it a few times , or whatever . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And it works . 
UNKNOWN Or just like pick it up when you're gonna use it . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I suppose . 
UNKNOWN Instead of you don't have to like make sure it's in the right place to charge and . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
CONFIRMATION Cool . 
UNKNOWN K okay . 
UNKNOWN 'S that the end of your presentation. 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
THANKS Thank you . 
UNKNOWN There we go . 
CONFIRMATION Thanks . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN It's not on my screen . 
UNKNOWN Why ? 
UNKNOWN it wasn't on mine either . 
UNKNOWN I don't know why . 
UNKNOWN I think , I just , I just used the mouse on there . 
UNKNOWN You don't know why ? 
UNKNOWN Oh okay . 
UNKNOWN Is it that one ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN That's um Oh . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um , I'm just gonna go through the interface concept with yous now . 
UNKNOWN Uh , first of all I'll explain what a user interface is . 
UNKNOWN It's the aspects of a computer system which can be seen or otherwise perceived , for example , heard or felt maybe , or by the human user . 
UNKNOWN And it's also the commands that the user uses to control its operation and to input data . 
UNKNOWN Um , there are two types of user interfaces . 
UNKNOWN There's the graphical user interface , which emphasises the use of pictures for output and a pointing device , for example a mouse for input control . 
UNKNOWN So that's sort of like the scroll thing we were talking about . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I'm not really sure about the pictures that maybe that's on an L_C_D_ screen . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Or maybe it's the the buttons or pictures or something . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Do you think it's Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So I suppose sometime after you . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , 'cause I'm sorry ? 
UNKNOWN Um , because command interface requires you to type textual commands and input at a keyboard , so the numbers are sort of like a keyboard . 
UNKNOWN You're pressing the numbers for , um , for what you want . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN So you must , for the graphical user you must need some kind of presentationfor the graphics . 
UNKNOWN Like an L_C_D_ screen . 
UNKNOWN I s I suppose where um mm on some buttons you would have like the power would be s some kind of symbol . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And if you wanted to go onto teletext or , I know we're not having that , but I mean a similar thing , you , they have there's a like little picture with a screen with lines across it , which I suppose it's that sort of thing like the , the symbol on the button . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But if we're having a simplified display anyway , w that , we probably won't have to focus so much on that . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , we'll be doing Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It'll be more the on the numbers and the volume . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It'd be more a command interface , and then Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I suppose we need to think of symbols for like the volume , display , and stuff like that . 
UNKNOWN So it's just draf graphical for the pointing aspect ? 
UNKNOWN The infrared is like , that's considered a Okay . 
UNKNOWN I For inp Mm . 
UNKNOWN Hmm ? 
UNKNOWN No I think it's to do with the actual symbols that are on the , that's on the buttons of the remote control , and per Well it could be a wee scroller thing , and something could come up on the screen . 
UNKNOWN So when it says pointing device that doesn't include Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think they're talking about L_C_D_ type things . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But um I think we're gonna go with the command interface anyway , to make it more simplistic . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN But the , we could incorporate some of the graphical user um points , as in just to make it m um nicer to look at maybe . 
UNKNOWN What do you mean ? 
UNKNOWN Like I can't think of an example , but Sort of like little pictures rather than Like a little sound . 
UNKNOWN Oh yeah , like how the buttons Yeah , as a button though . 
UNKNOWN Instead of saying volume , like a little speaker or something . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , something y Yeah m perha yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN So , it's a keyboard in the shape of it , right ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Maybe . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I like that idea . 
UNKNOWN Um , the co uh we've decided that the command interface would be the most useful for a remote control . 
UNKNOWN As it would be less complicated , and the controls would be more user-friendly . 
UNKNOWN Um , the remote control would be cheaper to design , so that we'd have more money in the budget to , um , target the design area of the interface . 
UNKNOWN You know , make it more trendy and original . 
UNKNOWN We'll have more money if we keep it simple . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I'm sure i like kinetic energy would probably dip into the budget . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN A bit more too , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Seeing as it's quite a new technology . 
UNKNOWN Um We , we also have to keep in mind when we're designing our , um , more user-friendly remote control , that a lot of interfaces consist of a clutter of buttons , that , um , that their functions , colours and forms aren't always helpful . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN That's true . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN That's in like the buttons with all the different like colours for different choices and things . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It can be a bit , yeah , overwhelming . 
UNKNOWN And that all interfaces are different . 
UNKNOWN So , um , that doesn't improve the use of the produ product , so we need to come up with something that's easy to understand . 
UNKNOWN And maybe learn from the mistakes of other interfaces that can be too complicated for people to use . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN Does anyone have any questions ? 
UNKNOWN Do you think that we should keep all the buttons to one same colour , just to keep it , give it a simplistic look . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN I think if we go with the um design plate thing , we'll have to . 
UNKNOWN Just because of colour clashing , and if we wanted to , so and , and we might , I mean , depending on what comes out of the design , we might have to stick to just black buttons . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But um Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But what about the lighting up effect ? 
UNKNOWN You mean different colours for the lighting or Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um , well , um , I thought we had um decided that we would if you touched one of the buttons they'd all light up . 
UNKNOWN And so if they were black , it wouldn't be possible for them to light up . 
UNKNOWN Oh I see what you're saying . 
UNKNOWN Well y Oh so you're picturing the light is coming from the back . 
UNKNOWN If they were white they would glow , probably . 
UNKNOWN If they were made out of rubber . 
UNKNOWN I kinda pictured it as kind of coming from the sides and lighting it up frontwards . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN But , but I guess , you mean from the back . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN Where would the light come from ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN I'd assume , like , an internal light , that comes through . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So there would have to , have to be some parts maybe transparent around the buttons , or something . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Yeah , and well rubber is a more translucent product too , so we have that taken care of . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN It should be able to mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN In the phone that I was thinking of as well , when you change the um covers of it , the , the little buttons that actually , you know , that contro control stuff , are behind the rubber . 
UNKNOWN Li yeah . 
UNKNOWN So you can change the buttons when you're changing the faces . 
UNKNOWN Do you know what I mean ? 
SURPRISE Oh .
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause it's just the wee control , yeah , thing that's behind it . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN They , they insert over . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So I mean , we don't have to decide on one colour . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Each face could have its own colour of buttons maybe ? 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Well , if they're raised up buttons . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So that you can feel them . 
UNKNOWN We were talking about it being more um , a lot more tangible . 
UNKNOWN T Okay is that my turn then ? 
UNKNOWN Um , it might be more difficult to do . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN If they're , if they're sticking up . 
UNKNOWN If it's flat then , like o like on a cellphone or a mobile phone , it's like all very flat , and you just have to sort of press down on these tiny little buttons , but Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think it would be possible . 
UNKNOWN I don't think it would make that much difference . 
UNKNOWN I mean , the uh the dimensions of it . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause if it's just like constructed in the same way as like the front cover of a mobile phone . 
UNKNOWN You can like take off the hard cover and then there's the like say the buttons . 
UNKNOWN And then you get to the circuit . 
UNKNOWN I don't think it would matter that the buttons were bigger through the , the top casing . 
UNKNOWN I'm sure you could f work it out to fit in the casing , without causing too much difficulty . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I'm sure that'd be fine . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
UNKNOWN If it's do-able we can do . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , sounds good to me . 
UNKNOWN So that's everything , then ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Alright , thank you . 
UNKNOWN That means you're up . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I have a shorter reportfor you today . 
UNKNOWN Um , it took a while to get this , uh Uh . 
UNKNOWN You're not plugged in yet . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN That's a very good point . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so um , this reportis about uh trend-watching . 
UNKNOWN Um , basically so we can live up to our , our uh purpose of having a very fashionable remote control . 
UNKNOWN Sorry . 
UNKNOWN There we go . 
UNKNOWN Um So , just so you know , my method was mainly web web-based research this time around . 
UNKNOWN I also spoke with fashion experts in Milan , New York and Paris . 
UNKNOWN And I looked at the design reports from previous years , here at Real Remote . 
UNKNOWN Um , just so c we can work off of them , see how fashions have changed . 
UNKNOWN Um , so I'll list the three most important aspects that I've come across . 
UNKNOWN Um , and they , they're each more important than the one that comes after it . 
UNKNOWN Uh , the first one is that there should be a fancy look-and-feel , instead of the current functional look-and-feel . 
UNKNOWN Um , this should be our priority , as we've been saying . 
UNKNOWN The second most important aspect is that a remote sh that the remote control should be technologically innovative . 
UNKNOWN So , I think we've done a lot of talking about that , just with lighting and the buttons and the face-plates . 
UNKNOWN Um , so it looks like we'll be able to keep on track with that . 
UNKNOWN And the third most important aspect is that the remote control should be easy to use . 
UNKNOWN So , pretty basic there . 
UNKNOWN And the recent fashion update , uh , according to fashion-watchers in Paris and Milan , is that fruit and vegetables will be the most important theme for clothes , shoes and furniture . 
UNKNOWN Um , also , in contra uh in contrast to last year , the feel of the material is expected to be spongy . 
UNKNOWN Again , we've already discussed that with rubber versus hard plastic buttons . 
UNKNOWN Um So , my personal preferences here , um of course , as we , we've already talked about the personal face-plates in this meeting , and I'd like to stick to that . 
UNKNOWN The fruits and vegetable themes , I don't know if that's going to work for us . 
UNKNOWN It sounds something that you'd use on kitchenware . 
UNKNOWN I don't know if we wanna do it on remotes . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN It could be one of the options . 
UNKNOWN Maybe for the television that people have in their kitchen . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um , the temporary light-up idea , sounds like we're gonna stick to that . 
UNKNOWN And then , uh , tying in a trendy look with user-friendliness . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , it's the fruits and vegetables is the only area that I find rather jarring . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Everything else we can really , we can really um , do , according to our plans already , given the market . 
UNKNOWN It is strange . 
UNKNOWN But fruits and vegetables seems a very strange idea for a remote control . 
UNKNOWN It's , it's a little but it , it's everywhere . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well We I think we possibly could take a more abstract design . 
UNKNOWN So maybe we I've seen a lot of purses with olives on them , you know . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But I I think , I think if we stick to T_V_ based , you know , maybe T_V_ shows , or Or colour schemes . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But they still need to um fit into people's decor though . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Like look at the basic shapes of different fruits and vegetables . 
UNKNOWN And then just really like strip it down to like really basic shapes . 
UNKNOWN I mean we don't have to make something in the shape of a strawberry , but it could have the curves of a strawberry , or something . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN The The essence of strawberry . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Or a strawberry seed or a leaf . 
UNKNOWN Or just like you know really make it a quite abstract , if that's fits in more with what we're doing . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Instead of fruits and vegetables , just if you look at it straightforward , it's a bit yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It doesn't s quite fit in with the trendy well , obviously it does , if that's the current theme . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But may maybe we could go more directly , I don't know . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But initially , I dunno . 
UNKNOWN I think if we just sort of tone it down a bit . 
UNKNOWN Tone it down . 
UNKNOWN I guess , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah and like not , not yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , like more like photos of fruit , on , on our product . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Or banana-shaped . 
UNKNOWN One thing I was thinking though is I dunno if you all remember from our kickoff meeting , we talked about our favourite animals . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So maybe there could be animal-based , you know . 
UNKNOWN Because a lot of people have a house cat . 
UNKNOWN Or , or a dog . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Um , that might be getting , you know , too specific , and we should see what the success of the first face-plates are . 
UNKNOWN But it's something to keep in mind . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN And , did you have any questions ? 
UNKNOWN Pretty straightforward ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah um Alright , given that information , we need to start making some more specific decisions . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So I'll need to um hook up the PowerPointagain . 
UNKNOWN There you go . 
UNKNOWN Have you guys been saving your PowerPointpresentationsto the okay . 
UNKNOWN I didn't for the first one . 
UNKNOWN But I have now . 
UNKNOWN But it's still around right ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Uh , hopefully . 
UNKNOWN Where do you have to save it to ? 
UNKNOWN Project documentsI think . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN I'm just trying to make this pop up now . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
UNKNOWN Here we go . 
UNKNOWN Okay so we have to uh decide now exactly what we are going to do . 
UNKNOWN So energy , we oh . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN Oh no I can't write it in when it's in this setting . 
UNKNOWN Does anyone know how to take it out of Um , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Just escape I think . 
UNKNOWN The PowerPoint? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um , so back to decisions . 
UNKNOWN Energy , we've decided on kinetic , right ? 
UNKNOWN Kinetic yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so that's good . 
UNKNOWN Are we going to have a backup ? 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Or do we just I think maybe we could just go for the kinetic energy , and be bold and innovative , and hope this works , and well hope that it works . 
UNKNOWN But would a backup really be necessary ? 
UNKNOWN I mean will people just use the battery if there's no , if there's , if there is backup . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think yeah . 
UNKNOWN There's like no reason why it wouldn't work , right ? 
UNKNOWN I think no . 
UNKNOWN So So if it's not working they just have to shake it a bit and that revitalises it ? 
UNKNOWN I , I think we should just like take uh advantage of like using this to its full potential . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It could even be one of our selling points . 
UNKNOWN Go for it . 
UNKNOWN It could be fully kinetic energy . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Environmentally conscious or something . 
UNKNOWN Is everyone happy with that ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Hope so . 
UNKNOWN Alright , the next um decision is chip on print. 
UNKNOWN I don't exactly know what that means . 
UNKNOWN Um , it was whether we went for the simple , the regular , or the advanced chip . 
UNKNOWN And that linked in with what buttons we would gonna have , so Yeah , it was so that was without the L_C_D_ . 
UNKNOWN Right , and we were going for more simplistic style , right ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So that means we're not doing the advanced . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So it depends on whether we wanted the scroll buttons or just the push buttons . 
UNKNOWN I think we decided on the pushbuttons , right ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I don yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh , so that's the simple . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Would we need a more advanced one for uh the lighting , the interior lighting system ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah possibly . 
UNKNOWN So , it's probably gonna be the regular chip that we're going to need . 
UNKNOWN Yeah ? 
UNKNOWN So it's a medium . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So regular chip . 
UNKNOWN That's called medium , or regular ? 
UNKNOWN Regular sorry . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN Regular chip . 
UNKNOWN Oh , is regular not simple ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Lighting . 
UNKNOWN Yeah if we because of the lighting that we've decided to put in as well . 
UNKNOWN It's for the lighting , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Right right right . 
UNKNOWN Okay , and cases . 
UNKNOWN Um , does this , is this dependent on shape , or what it's made of , or what ? 
UNKNOWN So th I think this is just like gonna be the a very outer case , which we will decide on rubber . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well , I guess plastic and coated in rubber . 
UNKNOWN Rubber . 
UNKNOWN Yeah plastic coat . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Plastic with rubber coating and interchangeable um yeah , interchangeable plates . 
UNKNOWN Plastic rubber coat . 
UNKNOWN Interchangeable , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Still going for that . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN User interface concept . 
UNKNOWN This is your time to shine . 
UNKNOWN We decided on the component . 
UNKNOWN I , I I'm sorry , I've lost my um PowerPointthing , so I can't remember what it's ca it's the component The command inter The command line interface yeah . 
UNKNOWN Your screen ? 
UNKNOWN Think it was called command interface . 
UNKNOWN Was it Ouch . 
UNKNOWN Oh , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Command interface , . 
UNKNOWN Command interface . 
UNKNOWN Did you say command line ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Line interface . 
UNKNOWN Alright , and supplements . 
UNKNOWN What's that all about ? 
UNKNOWN Um , I think that is well we haven't really made any decisions about what we're gonna do about the cluster of button functions , colours and forms , in the in consistent use . 
UNKNOWN Like what what are ideas to combat these problems ? 
UNKNOWN Um Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN You know how um different interfaces are very different , and can be confusing because because of their difference , and because of the different clusters of buttons that they have . 
UNKNOWN We haven't really decided what to do about that . 
UNKNOWN Um , what are our choices here ? 
UNKNOWN Well it's just um w where where shall we locate the buttons . 
UNKNOWN What kind of functions wi shall we have ? 
UNKNOWN You mean like we'll have the numbers of the channels , and we'll have the channel-changer , and volume , and power ? 
UNKNOWN The power . 
UNKNOWN Volume . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So pretty just just the basic button functions . 
UNKNOWN Um Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Like I don't know if we should go into like adjusting light levels , things like that , because different televisions will have Um , yeah . 
UNKNOWN May yeah . 
UNKNOWN Tone , contrast , and things . 
UNKNOWN That's a bit Yeah , it was minima well , it wasn't the l Yeah . 
UNKNOWN That was on , um one of my presentations. 
UNKNOWN About how often it was used . 
UNKNOWN Do you remember that ? 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , it was hardly ever used really . 
UNKNOWN I w Should I bring it up ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN That would be good . 
UNKNOWN And most televisions will come with a remote . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , and surely that would be like quite specific to the individual television , so Mm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , each television . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN 'Kay , well we know we want numbers . 
UNKNOWN The ch t Screen settings was used um zero point five times an hour . 
UNKNOWN So tw twice every once every two hours . 
UNKNOWN Um , and it was considered a one point five relevance , on a scale of ten . 
UNKNOWN That's brightness , colour , tone , all that . 
UNKNOWN You don't change that often , yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think most of that comes like on the i individual television set itself , doesn't it ? 
UNKNOWN I'm sure it has its own buttons , so you don't necessarily need to have it on remote . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , it does . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , and different televisions . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Like we , I don't know if we can make a remote that would be universal to all the different kinds of changes like that . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So we're just going for power , channels , volume , Mm . 
UNKNOWN Volume . 
UNKNOWN The other one was audio settings . 
UNKNOWN Mono , stereo , pitch . 
UNKNOWN I mean I sometimes use that . 
UNKNOWN Some T_V_s will have the option of like living room style , movie style , um and that , they say that's used zero point eight times an hour , which is actually somewhat high . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Like almost once an hour . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um , relevance of two . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN We have five minutes to finish our meeting . 
UNKNOWN Crap . 
UNKNOWN Okay , um , let's do this fast . 
UNKNOWN Um Should we have audio ? 
UNKNOWN Well that didn't some up on mine . 
UNKNOWN It only comes up on mine usually . 
UNKNOWN It w it would seem silly if we'd having anything else , just have an audio button though . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN Do you know ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I don't , I it's , it's a problem with the international uh appeal , I think . 
UNKNOWN Um , if we have audio because we don't know how other televisions work . 
UNKNOWN But we Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But we know that everyone has this and it's the same . 
UNKNOWN Yeah I guess that it affects the marketing , 'cause it , mm it is a good sales ploy to say , aren't you annoyed with remote controls that have all these buttons . 
UNKNOWN I've Yeah , that's it . 
UNKNOWN This one has channel , volume and your channe and your power . 
UNKNOWN That could be a sales pitch . 
UNKNOWN We can just go for , make it a selling point that it is just the basic . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Simple and Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah uh I brilliant . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
UNKNOWN Good . 
UNKNOWN And , okay , in closing , 'cause we only have five minutes . 
UNKNOWN We'll be meeting again in thirty minutes . 
UNKNOWN Um , you'll be working , Poppy will be working on the look-and-feel design . 
UNKNOWN Wait a minute. 
UNKNOWN Is that right ? 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Yep , and um the user interface design , so this is where the trendy stuff comes in . 
UNKNOWN And you'll be evaluating the product . 
UNKNOWN Um , Poppy and Tara will have to work together , using modelling clay . 
UNKNOWN And , um , your personal coach will give you the rest of the information of what needs to happen . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
UNKNOWN So , anyone else have something to say ? 
UNKNOWN Um , I just have one question about the whole fruit and vegetable aspect . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Are we seeing as that was the most popular thing that came up out of your market research , I thi I think we should keep to that rather than moving to animals or something , because even if that may not seem obvious to us , if that's what the surveys brought out , I think that we should probably go along with that . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um , so I suppose that'll come out in our dev design development . 
UNKNOWN But you're happy to go ahead with the fruit and veg ? 
UNKNOWN Now do you guys need want an idea of how many uh are you gonna come up with casing ideas ? 
UNKNOWN Like f five different Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Y Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN What I What I was thinking what do yous think of this ? 
UNKNOWN five . 
UNKNOWN . 
UNKNOWN Um , having the numbers kind of like , not a bunch of grapes , but you know like purple and kind of in a triangle . 
UNKNOWN Like grapes . 
UNKNOWN Yeah you can have some fun with the buttons , it's true . 
UNKNOWN Like that's kind of fruity or something . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN That's just Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN We can have a look at those ideas , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I guess what you i ideally you'd kind of think of age markets as well . 
UNKNOWN So it's a something that will , you know , appeal to the fifteen to twenty five year olds . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Something that your granny would want on her remote control . 
UNKNOWN Um , and international tastes as well , so Not easy . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Tricky . 
UNKNOWN A lot of things to consider . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Lots of yeah . 
UNKNOWN Hm . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN 'Kay we'll stick to the fruit and veggie theme then . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
UNKNOWN And , um , we'll reconvene in thirty minutes . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
FAREWELL Bye . 
THANKS Thank you . 
UNKNOWN I'll see you later . 
UNKNOWN Oh , what did I just do . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Here we go . 
UNKNOWN Alright , the agendafor thi oh . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
UNKNOWN Um the agendafor this meeting is um we'll initially have the prototype presentationby our two designers . 
UNKNOWN And then we will evaluate it , given the criteria that um that we gave gave it . 
UNKNOWN And um talk about our finances , whether we were under or over our budget . 
UNKNOWN I have a um a spreadsheetwhere we can calculate um our prices for every aspect of of what we've made , given our options . 
UNKNOWN And um evaluate the product , as a group . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN And um So first we'll have the prototype presentation. 
UNKNOWN Do you need the um PowerPointfor this ? 
UNKNOWN Um yeah . 
UNKNOWN I just got a few slides, so show them . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
THANKS Thank you . 
UNKNOWN Do you want to present it ? 
UNKNOWN Um This is what we came up with . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , here we are . 
UNKNOWN It's a pretty simple design . 
UNKNOWN It's um based on a mango ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And we Yeah . 
UNKNOWN On ? 
UNKNOWN Mango shape . 
UNKNOWN A mango . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN And we have the company logo here and this will be the infrared here and this'll be the power point , the on off button kind yeah . 
UNKNOWN The L_E_D_ . 
SURPRISE Oh .
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN I'm sorry . 
UNKNOWN What was the where's the L_E_D_ ? 
UNKNOWN Oops . 
UNKNOWN It's in the middle of one of the little R_s . 
SURPRISE Oh .
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN And then the other one is the power . 
UNKNOWN And uh we just have a simple design . 
UNKNOWN We wanted it all to be accessible from your thumb yeah palm-held and all the buttons are accessible from your thumb . 
UNKNOWN So it's palm-held . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Notice you have a number ten button . 
UNKNOWN So you don't have to Oh that was a mistake , wasn't it ? 
UNKNOWN Right no , that's a zero . 
UNKNOWN You just need the nought . 
UNKNOWN Take that one off . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Sorry . 
UNKNOWN I was in charge of the numbers . 
UNKNOWN No problem . 
UNKNOWN Ah . 
UNKNOWN And this is just if you've got like eleven or twelve or thirt the plus . 
UNKNOWN So one plus one would be eleven , or Yeah because if you on your average um remote , if you press one twice you just go to um or uh say you wanted channel twelve , you press one , and then you go to channel one , and then two then you'd just go to channel two , instead of twelve . 
UNKNOWN You can go one , three or something . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN You press that first and then you go one three yeah . 
UNKNOWN You press a plus button ? 
UNKNOWN Oh okay . 
UNKNOWN I've never heard of that kind before . 
UNKNOWN Well we just thought , we have all the numbers here , so we wanted something representative of numbers larger than ten and So the plus and then yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Oh , there's no e okay . 
UNKNOWN So if you did like one plus two you could go to channel twelve , or two plus two is channel twenty two . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN I But Would you have to go zero plus one if you wanted to go to channel one or two ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN No no , th all that's why we have all these numbers . 
UNKNOWN These numbers um these numbers all work independently up to nine . 
UNKNOWN Yeah but I mean if you press , it'll go to that channel right away . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause you gotta press the plus afterwards . 
UNKNOWN Oh no . 
UNKNOWN Uh , the plus is only for if you're going past the number nine . 
UNKNOWN Yeah I know , but if if I wanna go to say number like sixty five , channel sixty five , if I press the six it'll go to channel six , and then I'll press the plus , and then it'll go to six and then put the five and it'll go to sixty five ? 
UNKNOWN Sixty . 
UNKNOWN You p Oh . 
UNKNOWN No you press the plus first . 
UNKNOWN I I well it doesn't we haven't really s I would've thought you pressed the plus first and then the six five , but she says plus press which what do you think is simpler ? 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN Well I don't mind , we can further define that . 
UNKNOWN I th Um Yeah it wouldn't be a problem . 
UNKNOWN It's a Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I wouldn't have thought it'd be a problem that it went to channel six first , in like on the way to channel sixty five . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But I was just wondering like as long as we realise that's what it'll do . 
UNKNOWN But I suppose it's not as snappy . 
UNKNOWN Well the there is a there's a delay on remotes I think . 
UNKNOWN Oops . 
UNKNOWN Where you can have it it's like a five second input time . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN If you don't put it Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So as long as you hit them dada it should be fine . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN As long as there's not a big pause between the t hitting the two buttons . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So A channel . 
UNKNOWN Um And channel , which is so you could just go like that without thinking about it , like It's the bigger R_ . 
UNKNOWN Was there so on the top there is volume and Channel up volume up . 
UNKNOWN Okay cool . 
UNKNOWN C_ and V_ . 
UNKNOWN Just so we can flick It's in the middle of one of the little R_s . 
UNKNOWN Right , where um where's the power button ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It's the R_ . 
UNKNOWN Oh okay . 
UNKNOWN So it's just like . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , so it's all accessible . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN We deci Yeah um we went for like a a circular design for the numbers because we thought that's kind of a more natural movement than just going like that with your thumb . 
UNKNOWN Without m taking your hand off the remote . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Oh okay . 
UNKNOWN Uh e ergonomics are all considered . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And it might actually help with the repetitive stress injury as well . 
UNKNOWN Ergonomic , definitely ergonomic . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It could cause another type of repetitive stress injury though . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN But yeah , no I mean it's a different movement so yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um and the feel of it , I mean , we've made this out of Play Doh , which is representing the , you know , the rubber , and the spongy rubberness . 
UNKNOWN The spon yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um 'cause it was said before in the material specification that this the this anti-R_S_I_ um material is often used in stress balls so this has got a you know a bit of give to it , and it just feels feels different . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Bit of a stress ball feel . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Would you like to feel it yourselves ? 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN How it fits in the palm of your hand ? 
UNKNOWN I would . 
UNKNOWN My goodness . 
UNKNOWN There you go . 
CONFIRMATION Thanks . 
UNKNOWN And you ? 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN Genevieve ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Oh it's nice . 
UNKNOWN Oh I think I killed the five . 
UNKNOWN I did . 
UNKNOWN I killed the four . 
UNKNOWN And something hmm . 
UNKNOWN Oh god . 
UNKNOWN O Okay , as for the colours , we were presented with um a limited range of colours for this prototype . 
UNKNOWN Oh it smells good . 
UNKNOWN Of Play Doh yeah . 
UNKNOWN But we're thinking that , seeing as we're having it in interchangeable casing anyway , that this is not necessarily a representation of the true colours that we would necessarily use . 
UNKNOWN Or the combination . 
UNKNOWN Um and we're thinking to carry-on with the fruit and vegetable theme , the colour um combination just could just be named after different fruit , like banana could be black and yellow , watermelon red and green , or vanilla might be the most popular if it just uh blends in more settled cream instead of the others are all a bit garish . 
UNKNOWN Oh right . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause it'd be quite subtle and Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It looks more Think like vanilla and banana would . 
UNKNOWN Banana's more representative of our colour scheme , like the company the yellow and black . 
UNKNOWN Okay yeah . 
UNKNOWN So that for corporate identity that would probably be the most strength . 
UNKNOWN I mean watermelon , you know , m probably appealing to the yeah , seasonal . 
UNKNOWN Kinda Christmas , you know . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Apple green , brown , more kinda trendy , you know , khaki Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN The pomegranate's kinda girly and funky kind of , and then the vanilla's more for the more sophisticated customer who just wants something that fits in with all decor . 
CONFIRMATION Cool . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um yeah we thought of the components it was definitely um a focus of ergonomics and just a single ha handheld device , I mean you don't need to use both hands , one hand to hold this and type in with the other , you can just use your thumb . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um , as we said the rubber's probably used for comfort and anti-R_S_I_ and that's about it . 
UNKNOWN Alright , thank you very much . 
UNKNOWN Good work everyone . 
UNKNOWN Bravo You want the I don't know what order it goes in . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
UNKNOWN And so now that we've we have a prototype , uh we need to go over the finances and seeing if this prototype matches uh what our budget can handle . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So , I have something I'm going to Oh wait a minute. 
UNKNOWN Do you need to do a presentationfirst ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I'm gonna check that out for a second . 
UNKNOWN I have one . 
UNKNOWN Mm go Feel I think . 
UNKNOWN What time is it anyw Oh yeah sorry you're right . 
UNKNOWN Evaluation cri Okay . 
UNKNOWN Evaluation criteria is next in line . 
UNKNOWN That's me . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
GREETING Hello . 
UNKNOWN Oh there we go . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Come on my computer . 
UNKNOWN Come on . 
UNKNOWN Sorry my computer's giving me technical difficulties . 
UNKNOWN Just press um function eight again . 
UNKNOWN Should I press it again ? 
UNKNOWN Last time I did that it sh Okay . 
UNKNOWN You're right . 
UNKNOWN And then again I think . 
UNKNOWN One more time . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN Still not there . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay now I think for this one I could Would you guys prefer use the whiteboard or mayb maybe I'll just do it on right on the screen where you can see it . 
UNKNOWN Um , we're gonna be doing an evaluation reporttogether based on the protoptype that we've just seen . 
UNKNOWN Um and looking looking back at my notesfrom our both our conceptual and our functional meetings , um I made a list of what our original requirements and goals were , um , back to our kick-off meeting this morning . 
UNKNOWN Um , and we'll evaluate as to whether we've s done what we set out to do . 
UNKNOWN Um and we're gonna do it on a one to seven scale where one is true and seven is false . 
UNKNOWN So basically the lower p the lower the points the better . 
UNKNOWN Okay so question number one . 
UNKNOWN Does the remote whoops . 
UNKNOWN Sorry . 
UNKNOWN Oh I'm not gonna be able um , I'll do it on the whiteboard . 
UNKNOWN I can't change it so I'm g I'm gonna ask you to push it down once . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN I'll write down our scores up on the Okay so number one . 
UNKNOWN Ooh . 
UNKNOWN Do we have a fancy look-and-feel ? 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN We've been quite successful with the rubber coating and Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN The look is a little bit more playful . 
UNKNOWN Well Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah I guess that depends on your definition of fancy , but it's definitely different . 
UNKNOWN It's not your traditional yeah . 
UNKNOWN Oh definitely different yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think the colour has a lot to do with it . 
UNKNOWN I mean th the colours we were given for making the prototype aren't the colours that I think we would've necessarily chosen . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It's not the kind of ooh uh at all sleek red , black and yellow , and orange . 
UNKNOWN Oh you were only given red and black ? 
UNKNOWN Oh okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah so not very sleek and we don't wanna go for black because most remote controls are black or grey . 
UNKNOWN Um But if you can imagine that in like a s just a maybe uh a kind of pale metallic-y finish or something Well I know know it's for rubber . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So we want it to be stand out that way , anyway . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN A metallic-y finish we were thinking . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Polished . 
UNKNOWN I mean diff if you can visualise this in nice colours I think it would look quite fancy . 
UNKNOWN Okay Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I kinda I like the potato look . 
UNKNOWN It's mango . 
UNKNOWN It's very different . 
UNKNOWN Oh well , potato , mango , fruit and veg . 
UNKNOWN We we were we were thinking about yeah . 
UNKNOWN It's what ? 
UNKNOWN It's mango . 
UNKNOWN Oh sorry the mango the mango look . 
UNKNOWN Potato's fine . 
UNKNOWN Yeah it is , fruit or vegetable depends on your mood . 
UNKNOWN Potato's fine . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Totally . 
UNKNOWN It's really adaptable . 
UNKNOWN So I myself would say a one or a two . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I would say two . 
UNKNOWN Personally . 
UNKNOWN I w I'd say two I think . 
UNKNOWN It's a two ? 
UNKNOWN Okay , and p One being true . 
UNKNOWN For the fancy I uh two , three . 
UNKNOWN Fanciness . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So Two . 
UNKNOWN Okay , actu that's pro that's gonna get confusing , like that . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay so question number two was is it techn technologically innovative ? 
UNKNOWN So I know we have the kinetic energy which is very innovative . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah and the use of the rubber . 
UNKNOWN Use of the rubber , the use of the L_E_D_ . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN For the anti-R_S_I_ . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN The L_E_D_ use isn't particularly innovative and we don't have any scroll buttons , it's all pushbuttons , there's no L_C_D_ control , so if we're thinking about the rest of the market , it's sort of probably halfway . 
UNKNOWN Isn't Mm-hmm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN In some aspects it is , like we said . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I'd say maybe three . 
UNKNOWN I'll go for three as well . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And I think I mean it it's tough to say because we were we didn't want it to be any more innovative than this , because then that would've defeated the purpose . 
NEGATION No . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah we want it simple . 
UNKNOWN Though it was our specification . 
UNKNOWN Wouldn't be simple , yeah . 
UNKNOWN So I mean I we'll put three , but I think we actually reached our goal . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN We didn't want it any more than that . 
UNKNOWN Okay question number three . 
UNKNOWN Uh , will it be easy to use ? 
UNKNOWN I think so . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah very . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think one for that . 
UNKNOWN S Yeah I think it's you can't really get confused with that . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN One . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN I mean , there'll be s we have to work out the uh number the plus system . 
UNKNOWN Th The plus number thing . 
UNKNOWN Yeah that's the only thing yeah . 
UNKNOWN But once that's figured out , it should be fine . 
UNKNOWN Yeah and perhaps the turning on but Mm . 
UNKNOWN Number four . 
UNKNOWN Is this a good-looking remote ? 
UNKNOWN Remember that seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly . 
UNKNOWN It's definitely Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Again I think the colour comes into this . 
UNKNOWN Yeah colour will definitely be a factor . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN I think that the logo could be smaller . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN And maybe not such a prominent way . 
UNKNOWN But the Remember the management said that it it had to be prominent . 
UNKNOWN Maybe like at the bottom , kind of . 
UNKNOWN Not in Don't worry . 
UNKNOWN Whoops . 
UNKNOWN Oh it just had to be on there I guess . 
UNKNOWN Should just not touch it . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN This time it's the three I killed . 
UNKNOWN I was just wondering if it should be like flatter . 
UNKNOWN Or Well Yeah the bottom could be like ch chopped a bit . 
UNKNOWN I suppose I've got quite big hands . 
UNKNOWN I like the appeal of it being like a big glob in your hand . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But you know what I've just thought of there now . 
UNKNOWN What where's it gonna sit in your living room ? 
UNKNOWN Is it not gonna fall off the arm of the sofa ? 
UNKNOWN Maybe if the bottom was just sort of flat , and then the rest is like round . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But then it wouldn't sit as comfortably in your hand . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN That's true . 
UNKNOWN It would still be comfortable I think . 
UNKNOWN Thing is like that , it's not going anywhere particularly . 
UNKNOWN We c we could handle it I think . 
UNKNOWN Maybe , it could it could be on the bottom , so you wouldn't loo like if it's flat here , so it sits up . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Like that . 
UNKNOWN Oh that would be nice . 
UNKNOWN Ah it'd fall over all the time though . 
UNKNOWN It'd be annoying . 
UNKNOWN Uh yeah , it's less um , what's th ha . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I g If it's weighted maybe . 
UNKNOWN H it's got higher centre of gravity like that . 
UNKNOWN Details , details . 
UNKNOWN 'Kay we're done designing . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Come on . 
UNKNOWN So , is this a good-looking remote ? 
UNKNOWN Would we wanna show it off to our friends ? 
UNKNOWN Three . 
UNKNOWN You would though , 'cause it's bit it's more interesting than other remotes . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think , it was another colour and it was like I think it'd look okay . 
UNKNOWN I think maybe a two . 
UNKNOWN Yeah ? 
UNKNOWN I mean I gue yeah , it's personal taste , but Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I would definitely go for that rather than like your average plain old remote like that , but definitely in another colour , I'm not happy with those colours . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so should we say two for that ? 
CONFIRMATION Sure . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Uh , question number five . 
UNKNOWN What's um will people be willing to spend twenty five Euros on this product ? 
UNKNOWN Remember that eighty percent of users were willing to spend more money when a remote control looked fancy . 
UNKNOWN I think we have to market it in the right way , that um to say that it is simplistic . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So people don't just see it and think , uh , this is so simplistic , I don't want to spend twenty five Euros . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN We have to market it . 
UNKNOWN Yeah it the marketing will have a lot to do with it . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And the kinetic energy , shaker-style-y , whoo , ooh no . 
UNKNOWN And the kinetic energy part . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Shake it and the buttons fall off . 
UNKNOWN Durable . 
UNKNOWN Don't shake Oh no the plus . 
UNKNOWN But you know , those'll be firmly on . 
UNKNOWN No , I guess , I don't know much about the remote control industry , how much your average sells for , but I know I am , aren't I ? 
UNKNOWN You're use the zero . 
UNKNOWN Make a new one . 
UNKNOWN But you're our Marketing Expert . 
UNKNOWN I think they're about ten po ten pound , aren't they ? 
UNKNOWN About ten pounds . 
UNKNOWN But you don't have to buy batteries . 
UNKNOWN Fifteen ? 
UNKNOWN So in the long term this can actually save you money . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Mm , yeah , that's true . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN So we'll market it that way too . 
UNKNOWN Exactly . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Exactly . 
UNKNOWN So yeah I think with a good marketing scheme um and the personalisation options , it'll Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Good point . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I would give it a two still though . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Okay number six . 
UNKNOWN Can someone read it out ? 
UNKNOWN Or Um yeah . 
UNKNOWN Does this prototype match the operating behaviour of the average user . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So that was mainly that the statistics we said Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think it does very well . 
UNKNOWN Oh yeah . 
UNKNOWN Because yeah , because the most accessible buttons are the volume and the and the channel-changing . 
UNKNOWN The zap yeah . 
UNKNOWN And it's just you won't have to think about it . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN You don't have to look down to find them . 
UNKNOWN They're clearly there , easy to use . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah I guess the I think the key word there is average , 'cause there were some people that used the uh video input and sound and stuff . 
UNKNOWN Simple . 
UNKNOWN Uh Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But they're not you and I really . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN So . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay so one ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Number seven . 
UNKNOWN C Heather could you push it down ? 
UNKNOWN Will this remote control be easy to find when lost ? 
UNKNOWN Remember that fifty percent of users lose their remote regularly . 
UNKNOWN Now is there the is the alarm system still was it implemented ? 
UNKNOWN We have the alarm system . 
UNKNOWN Yeah the bu when you press the alarm system , the lights behind the and it'll vibra It'll be again in the marketing . 
UNKNOWN It Yeah l lights on and , or flash as well . 
UNKNOWN But I mean it's not obviously obvious from the outside that that's gonna happen 'cause you can't s particularly see an alarm . 
UNKNOWN I thought the light from the inside was gonna light up . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN The light it will . 
UNKNOWN Or or was it gonna make a noise ? 
UNKNOWN But But both Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But when the alarm's not yeah . 
UNKNOWN If you Yeah . 
UNKNOWN You press the button it makes a noise right ? 
UNKNOWN It turns into a duck and starts quacking . 
UNKNOWN You could s Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Here I am . 
UNKNOWN Awesome . 
UNKNOWN Oh , that would be brilliant . 
UNKNOWN Awesome . 
UNKNOWN I'd be tempted to Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well the thing is , if it was had an alarm system , I mean , when it when it lights up as we I mean it could light up when the alarm went . 
UNKNOWN Um Okay . 
UNKNOWN But if it was hidden underneath the cushion or something , there wouldn't be any point . 
UNKNOWN So you can't see the alarm , but it would light up . 
UNKNOWN It would have to be in the market Yeah but you still couldn't see it . 
UNKNOWN I though w it was gonna make a noise . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Alarm , but you can't see an alarm inside uh the alarm system itself . 
UNKNOWN It would just be a little speaker on the back or something . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN We oh you're just explaining why it's not on the prototype . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But yeah , it'll be there . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So we can we could say that We can give it a one , because compared to every other remote ever m ever made , this one will be easier to find . 
UNKNOWN Oh okay . 
UNKNOWN It w yeah . 
UNKNOWN Whoo . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Sorry . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , totally . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um Question number eight . 
UNKNOWN Sorry Heather . 
UNKNOWN That wasn't very clear . 
UNKNOWN No problem , mm . 
UNKNOWN Will it be easy to learn how to use this remote when brand new ? 
UNKNOWN Remember that thirty four percent of users usually found it difficult . 
UNKNOWN So it has to be yeah , it's eas they'll pick it up and they'll know what to do . 
UNKNOWN Totally . 
UNKNOWN So the plu the plus w once that's written down on the pagethat'll be really simple , won't it ? 
UNKNOWN The plus thing needs to be worked on . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah I think just because it's we've decided to reduce it down to the basic buttons , I think that in itself makes it so much easier to use . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well Do Does it make more sense for the middle one to be an just an enter button ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So then you would have to push two buttons every time at least . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , so it's just like channel six , six , enter . 
UNKNOWN That kind of annoys me though , when it's zero six when you have to press I don't know why . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah but you don't have to press zeros . 
UNKNOWN You could just press six enter , or one two enter . 
UNKNOWN Oh okay . 
UNKNOWN And or sixty six enter , y Yeah I think that's probably more straightforward . 
UNKNOWN And then like twelve , enter . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Alright , aye . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Good Ooh . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um , okay so we can we'll say yes it's uh one ? 
UNKNOWN I'd say w yeah one . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Question number nine . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN Uh , will it minimise the effects of R_S_I_ , which was repeated strain injury ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Injury . 
UNKNOWN Um , which affected over a quarter of users . 
UNKNOWN S It's soft , and And people could Mm-hmm . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN I think so . 
UNKNOWN It's like right in the Your thumb might get a little bit uh Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But if you're zapping yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's what I was thinking . 
UNKNOWN I don't think it will f Yeah , the biology . 
UNKNOWN We may have to do some more research into other strain injuries that we don't know about . 
UNKNOWN But it is soft . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN And that's kind of what the um the PowerPointslidething said would be good for R_S_I_ , so maybe it is but Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I don't know what other options there are . 
UNKNOWN I think we're getting that's true . 
UNKNOWN Could I mean , you could hold it in your left hand and d use your index finger . 
UNKNOWN But there's not really any other options unless it's like a keyboard . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN So , I think we did as as much as you can with a remote control . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So , one or two do you think ? 
UNKNOWN I I'd say t two . 
UNKNOWN I think yeah , I think too . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Two okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay number ten . 
UNKNOWN Did we somehow incorporate the company colour and logo ? 
UNKNOWN Yes we did . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Now is the colour gonna be there even if it's like vanilla ? 
UNKNOWN Is the yellow Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN N We we can't really do that because for example on the banana theme we can't have it as being yellow . 
UNKNOWN It won't stand out . 
UNKNOWN So n it's not always gonna be the same colour . 
UNKNOWN It sounds like the colour's something that we But I mean the yell yeah d yellow's ugly though , depending on the So I think we'll have to talk to our executive managers , and see if we can get away with just the R_R_ . 
UNKNOWN Well , yeah the colours are yellow and grey . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Gray , yeah . 
UNKNOWN So it could be grey on the banana one . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , could be grey . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah that's right , we didn't even rea Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think this is the the factor that we've been least successful in confronting . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Perhaps a metallic or or like that's grey , and it wouldn't be that expensive to have a little bit of metal . 
UNKNOWN Mm , yeah . 
UNKNOWN No ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN That isn't rubber . 
UNKNOWN And the buttons in the middle . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So , do you think that's more of a three then ? 
UNKNOWN Three , four ? 
UNKNOWN Four I think . 
UNKNOWN Four ? 
UNKNOWN Well I don't what do what Okay . 
UNKNOWN Well we have good reasons for it , so we but we can still put a a four ? 
UNKNOWN Hum . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Okay , and final question . 
UNKNOWN Um , did we stay true to our motto and put the fashion into electronics ? 
UNKNOWN Current trends of fruits and veggies , desire for sponginess . 
UNKNOWN I would say so . 
UNKNOWN Following that briefing we did . 
UNKNOWN But maybe more like two 'cause there's no like pictures of fruit , it's just sort of naming it by a fruit . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN With the with the colours . 
UNKNOWN Like um the colour scheme names and stuff . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN No , uh , are the plates interchangeable ? 
UNKNOWN I think I missed a few they are ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So you can have banana and kiwi and okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so that's something that's kind of in the making too , like maybe it'll become more Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN That's fashionable in itself to have interchangeable plates . 
UNKNOWN It is . 
UNKNOWN I think w yeah , I think one . 
UNKNOWN Well that was our brief and we followed the brief . 
UNKNOWN Well we haven't got a big banana but Oh yeah . 
UNKNOWN The thing is , I think if somebody saw that and you said what was that inspired from , I don't know if you'd instantly say mango . 
UNKNOWN Be like Yeah . 
NEGATION No . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN Maybe if it was scented . 
UNKNOWN Oh yeah . 
UNKNOWN Oh that would be class . 
UNKNOWN There we go . 
UNKNOWN That would be great . 
UNKNOWN Yeah we have money for that . 
UNKNOWN Um Alright so based on this evaluation , do we average them out sorta thing ? 
UNKNOWN Um Okay . 
UNKNOWN Yes we do . 
UNKNOWN So I wh what was I gonna put for that ? 
UNKNOWN A two for fashion ? 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN I would say two . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Two . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so our average there , five , six , eight , ten , eleven , twelve , thirteen , fifteen , nineteen , twenty one , divided by eleven is Between okay . 
UNKNOWN It's Yeah . 
UNKNOWN One point nine or something ? 
UNKNOWN It's Between one and two . 
UNKNOWN I don't know these things . 
UNKNOWN Um , between one and two . 
UNKNOWN So that's pretty fantastic . 
UNKNOWN Close to two . 
CONFUSION Um . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's very good 'cause the highest we coulda got is one . 
UNKNOWN I got Yeah , 'cause we've a four to bring down . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
UNKNOWN Does that seem right then ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Uh , aye . 
UNKNOWN It seems like it should be more around two . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh , should've added five . 
UNKNOWN Do we have an online calculator ? 
UNKNOWN I'm attempting to do that right now . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN This is . 
UNKNOWN Yeah it is one point nine . 
UNKNOWN Ooh . 
UNKNOWN Yay . 
UNKNOWN Oh wow . 
UNKNOWN Well done . 
UNKNOWN Go Heather Pauls . 
UNKNOWN Well that's excellent . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Alright , now with that over and done with , our next step is to see if we are under budget . 
UNKNOWN And um my computer's frozen . 
UNKNOWN And now it's not . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So um in our shared folder , if everyone could go there right now , um I'm going to um steal a cable . 
UNKNOWN Sorry . 
UNKNOWN Are you gonna do that ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um it's it's um it's an Excel file. 
UNKNOWN Is that the project document? 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN Production costs . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN 'Kay there we go . 
UNKNOWN Um , production costs . 
UNKNOWN And um I have to access that as well . 
UNKNOWN It says it I think it just means that we can't add any more to it now . 
UNKNOWN One moment . 
UNKNOWN 'Kay so far I've added what I think or what is going on ? 
CONFIRMATION Great . 
UNKNOWN It's blinking at me . 
UNKNOWN It's locked for editing . 
UNKNOWN Read only . 
UNKNOWN I'm gonna open up a second one then 'cause it's locked for editing . 
UNKNOWN I have the original in my um my emailaccount . 
UNKNOWN Oh is it locked 'cause I'm in it ? 
UNKNOWN I dunno . 
UNKNOWN Or okay . 
UNKNOWN Have you have you completed it ? 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN Oh right . 
UNKNOWN No , I was hoping that you guys could . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um , there we go . 
UNKNOWN Okay here we go . 
UNKNOWN So we need to tally up how much our w our product will be costing . 
UNKNOWN So um if you can look up at the screen , um the large screen , oh I guess looking at your own too and telling me which one you think . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay we're using kinetic which is quite a large expense at three Euros . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Oh right . 
UNKNOWN Um we're using a regular chip . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um , it's cur it's double curved , so its curved all around . 
UNKNOWN Double double-curved yeah . 
UNKNOWN That's another three . 
UNKNOWN We're already at five . 
UNKNOWN Um , we're using plastic and rubber , so Good thing plastic is free , we're at eight . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um S Yeah . 
UNKNOWN What about a special colour ? 
UNKNOWN Are we using that ? 
UNKNOWN I guess we should do it just for one kind . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So it's like special colour well we'll have two colours right ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well one colour for the case , one colour for the buttons . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So we can Um , we have push button interface , so that's inexpensive . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And um we have a special colour for the button , and we also have a special form . 
UNKNOWN And a special material . 
UNKNOWN And a special material . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Oof . 
UNKNOWN Which puts us just barely under budget . 
UNKNOWN Hurray . 
UNKNOWN Congratulations guys . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN 'S good . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Good work guys . 
UNKNOWN So um our operating cost is twelve twenty Euros . 
UNKNOWN That's good . 
UNKNOWN Awesome . 
UNKNOWN And back to our PowerPoint. 
UNKNOWN So we've 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN Yes we are . 
UNKNOWN So we need to do a product evaluation , again , which is probably um I dunno . 
UNKNOWN A different extension of a Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Of the actual project rather than the product ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN A project ? 
UNKNOWN Is is yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah 'cause we're talking about leadership , teamwork . 
UNKNOWN So wh how we actually went round uh about doing it . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Alright so um Do you guys feel like there was room for creativity ? 
UNKNOWN I think we were pushed . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Pushed for creativity ? 
UNKNOWN I mean we weren't really given a lot of time , or materials , yeah , to go about our design task . 
UNKNOWN The ma Or materials . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So I think we could've done with a bit more time . 
UNKNOWN Ye Okay . 
UNKNOWN So it'd be like need more time and materials . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But you were allowed m creativity ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think so as like but you were supposed to have creativ Right . 
UNKNOWN Yeah and the conceptual and functional . 
UNKNOWN Like we were very creative in in coming up with an idea I guess , but m When we can down to it . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well we were just limited by resources really and like if we had decided to use the L_C_D_ screen , and like solar power backup and everything , then we wouldn't have been able to afford that . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So that did limit creativity . 
UNKNOWN Creativity . 
UNKNOWN Right Okay Great . 
UNKNOWN Just resources . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN But yeah . 
UNKNOWN The fruit and veg idea . 
UNKNOWN Leadership ? 
UNKNOWN Is this me being like , guys do you like me ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Good leadership , I think we stayed on task . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah we did . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN We've , uh seeing as we've come out with what we intended . 
UNKNOWN A pro um a product within the budget . 
UNKNOWN I think that's a sign of good leadership and also our personal coach helped us along the way , so you know I think it's been fine . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And the timing was good . 
UNKNOWN We never were pushed for time , or sat around doing nothing , so Was good teamwork . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Good timing . 
UNKNOWN Oop Okay . 
UNKNOWN And project manager of course . 
UNKNOWN Teamwork ? 
UNKNOWN I think we worked great as a team . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think we are well-suited to our roles . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Alright how were our means ? 
UNKNOWN Um Yeah and more Play Doh , 'cause that was all the red we had . 
UNKNOWN We needed more Play Doh colours . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So even if we wanted to make a bigger prototype , we wouldn't have been able to . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , it c it might've been bigger . 
UNKNOWN Oh really ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN But ever everything else was satisfactory ? 
UNKNOWN Is that good Yeah ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN The computer programmes are good . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN The Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It could be really straightforward for the computer . 
UNKNOWN I don't think there was anything Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think the only thing was having to remember to you know to tick the okays but I think I was the only one who struggled with that . 
UNKNOWN I'm actually not sure if I've saved my presentations. 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN They'll probably still be there . 
UNKNOWN Uh me too . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN New ideas found . 
UNKNOWN I don't really know what that means . 
UNKNOWN Um I'm not sure , new ideas found . 
UNKNOWN Well I think we've all learnt stuff from each other , like the n um yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Through discussion . 
UNKNOWN Just about each different . 
UNKNOWN Got new ideas from each other . 
UNKNOWN Hmm ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah well I guess we really it we bounced off of each other , which was cool . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Like based on marketing stuff and then you'd say something about interface and yeah , worked well . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And we were a able to modify each other's ideas to fit in with our areas of expertise . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Each other's Mm . 
UNKNOWN Oh does it have smart materials by the way ? 
CONFUSION Sorry ? 
UNKNOWN Does it have smart materials ? 
UNKNOWN Oh yeah . 
UNKNOWN Oh yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well mm , did it come into the into I dunno if we counted that in the costs . 
UNKNOWN If if it if it If it can be afforded . 
UNKNOWN Okay ? 
UNKNOWN Well with that achieved , our last slideis our closing slide. 
UNKNOWN Yes our costs are within budget . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN It's evaluated generally positively . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN And um don't forget to complete final questionnaire and meeting summary . 
UNKNOWN Then we celebrate in such a way that I have no idea . 
CONFUSION Uh . 
UNKNOWN Yay . 
UNKNOWN Fantastic . 
UNKNOWN By watching T_V_ ? 
UNKNOWN Okay , brilliant . 
UNKNOWN Alright ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
THANKS Thank you very much . 
UNKNOWN Okay , bye . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Conclusion ? 
UNKNOWN Dadada . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Oh , that's not gonna work . 
UNKNOWN Oh , alright . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um alright . 
UNKNOWN I'll just put that there . 
UNKNOWN Uh as you all know we're here to create a brand new fantastic remote . 
UNKNOWN Uh I'm Nick Debusk , I'm the Project Manager . 
UNKNOWN Uh we'll just get started with everyone kind of letting each other know who they are and what you're doing , what your what your role is um . 
UNKNOWN Go ahead . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN I am Corinne Whiting and I will be the Marketing Expert and in each of the three phases I will have a different role . 
UNKNOWN In the function design phase I will be talking about user requirement specification , and this means what needs and desires are to be fulfilled , and I'll be doing research to figure this out . 
UNKNOWN In the conceptual design phase I will be dealing with trend watching and I'll be doing marketing research on the web . 
UNKNOWN And then finally in the um detailed design phase I will be doing product evaluation and so I will be collecting the requirements and ranking all the requirements to see how we did . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN Hiya , I'm Ryan . 
UNKNOWN Um I'm the User Interface Designer . 
UNKNOWN Um likewise I've three different roles for each stage of design . 
UNKNOWN Um the functional design is looking at the tex technical functions of a remote control . 
UNKNOWN Um in the concept design , the user interface , how the user reacts with the the product . 
UNKNOWN And the detailed design um sort of like the user interface design , what they might be looking for , uh things like fashions , what makes wha how we're gonna make it special . 
UNKNOWN That's about it . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN I'm Manuel and I'm the Industrial Designer in in this project um . 
UNKNOWN In the functional design phase I'm I'll be dealing mostly with the requirements , um we'll discuss what the prog what functions the the product has to fulfil and so and so on . 
UNKNOWN Um I suppose we'll work pretty much together on that one . 
UNKNOWN Um um in the conceptual design um I'll be pro mostly dealing with properties and materials um of our product . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And uh the detailed design in the detailed design I'll be concerned with the look and feel of the product itself , um so we're pretty much working together obviously on the design front here . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um so we've got our opening , our our agendais the opening , uh acquaintance which we've kinda done . 
UNKNOWN Uh tool training , project plan discussion and then closing . 
UNKNOWN Uh grand total of twenty five minutes we have here . 
UNKNOWN Um so we are putting together a new remote control . 
UNKNOWN Um we want it to be something original . 
UNKNOWN Um of course we're a not only a electronics company but a fashion um conscious electronics company , so we want it to be trendy um and we want it to be easy to use . 
UNKNOWN Um we've got the functional design , conceptual design and detailed design um which basically is is the three of you um . 
UNKNOWN And w uh well um functional design um . 
UNKNOWN Um do we have um any ideas of of maybe d let's just throw out some ideas of what kind of remote control we want to have , and then we can go into how we're gonna design it and and how we're gonna do the detailing on it . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well uh s function of remote control is just just you know , change channels is its main function . 
UNKNOWN So we want it to be um a T_V_ remote or I I mean do we want it to to do other things besides just be a a television remote ? 
UNKNOWN Oh right . 
UNKNOWN I suppose you c try make it a universal remote for could work on all sort of electrical products in in one person's house . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN But , you know , they all sorta have the same role changing channels , volumes and then programming . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN I think they all work on the same prin principle as well sorta like I don't actually know . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN But is it just infra-red ? 
UNKNOWN Is that standard ? 
UNKNOWN I I think yeah , yeah , r universal remote . 
UNKNOWN Ye yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um this is my first uh go-round with creating a remote control , so I think we're all in the same boat here . 
UNKNOWN Huh . 
UNKNOWN Ours too . 
UNKNOWN Um Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um one thing I thought of with the remote control is you always lose 'em . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN So if there's a g a way of finding it quite easily , I thought that'd be quite good quite a good feature . 
UNKNOWN Ch Like a tracking device ? 
UNKNOWN So we should we should set our remote control up to where it has a uh like a tracking device or or like a a It makes a noise , there's a button on the T_V_ that you press and 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN Oh you can get those key well you could whistle or make a noise and it'd beep . 
UNKNOWN Mm , mm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Be good . 
UNKNOWN So Mm . 
UNKNOWN Generally , all remotes are sort of quite similar in their appearance . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Just long . 
UNKNOWN Do we want so they're kinda like long and rectangular . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Do we want something crazy ? 
UNKNOWN Black usually . 
UNKNOWN You know , we want something new that's gonna stand out . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Lot more modern . 
UNKNOWN I think so . 
UNKNOWN A m a modern so our remote should be 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN Maybe sorta spherical or something . 
UNKNOWN A ball . 
UNKNOWN Maybe like user-friendly , like a little you know , where you can use both hands , like a little keyboard type thing . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN People I thought maybe , because people always tend to throw a remote control about the place to one another if it was in a ball , and maybe the actual controls are inside or something . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Well there are of course certain restrictions , you can't have it be any form and fulfil all functions at the same time , so there are always the some restrictions we have to apply here . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um however um one question is how stable is that thing supposed to be , that refers to the material , pretty much um . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN What are we gonna build that thing out of ? 
UNKNOWN How sturdy is it gonna be ? 
UNKNOWN Do we want it to last longer or rather have people whatever , have to buy one every half a year ? 
UNKNOWN Okay so yeah , so we want it to be sturdy , we want it to to hold up to somebody's child , you know , throwing it across the room or , as you said , people kinda throw it , so ball-shaped , uh you know , if it were ball-shaped maybe , then it 'Kay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It could be cased on the outside and t everything could be inside . 
UNKNOWN Um so we want it to be modern , fun , sturdy , um So our form and our function . 
UNKNOWN Um we want it to be um easy to find . 
UNKNOWN Um What else it what else do we want it to to do ? 
UNKNOWN So we want it to be universal . 
UNKNOWN It's something that we're supposed to sell for about twenty five Euros um and you know , goals for profits are I think somewhere around uh fifty million Euros , what they wanna make on it , so . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Also since we're partners of the International Remote Control Association , maybe we wanna make it something that would globally appeal . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN That's more on the research end , but the marketing . 
UNKNOWN So marketing , you know , how maybe uh marketing , you could s find out what is the most universally um appealing remote control out there . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And maybe as far as design goes , maybe we could have different ones for different target audiences , 'cause maybe one won't apply to all of the countries we're targeting . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN Ye Small . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Um Do you guys have any ideas for what it should look like ? 
UNKNOWN Maybe we could drawit up on the on the board over there . 
UNKNOWN Some ideas ? 
UNKNOWN We want it to be a b a ball , you know , we'll drawup we'll drawup the ball and maybe th um where the buttons are located . 
UNKNOWN I'd I could drawsorta the ball idea . 
UNKNOWN My original idea was just simply sort of a sphere , where maybe you this is where it's connected together , and then when you open it out , it could fol it could be maybe flip , like a flip phone , and then when you fold it out the middle Maybe a hinge that'll have to be the strongest part of it . 
UNKNOWN If that if we did use a hinge , or if it was just two parts , and then you'd have just sorta you you you know , your buttons . 
UNKNOWN Thing is inside I think , sometimes remotes have too many buttons , so maybe as simple as possible , um as few buttons inside as possible . 
UNKNOWN Um , I dunno , what's the idea for . 
UNKNOWN Just something maybe if you ha if it had like if some kind of like light or something or lights around it . 
UNKNOWN It's looking a bit like something out of Star Wars at the moment though , to be fair . 
UNKNOWN But yeah . 
UNKNOWN Futuristic . 
UNKNOWN That was that was a sorta simple idea I had and then you know you could about Right , it would almost be like a ball . 
UNKNOWN Uh-huh . 
UNKNOWN So that was just just an idea I had . 
UNKNOWN I don't know whether anybody else has other ideas ? 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN One problem you'd get with this design is um the ball is a nice idea because of it's stability really , but of course , since it's a ball , it'll roll , so we'd have to have it flat on one side at least , down here somewhere , take away that part . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Maybe f yeah . 
UNKNOWN That's one of the big issues . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's g that's a good idea . 
UNKNOWN Also also you risk the hinges here . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN That's that's um a problem . 
UNKNOWN The idea it didn't have to necessarily be f a hinge , that was just one idea though . 
UNKNOWN That's that's interesting of course , but that's of course a weak point , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN How would we go about um making you know getting rid of our weak points ? 
UNKNOWN What I mean would we just have a flat spot on the bottom of the ball ? 
UNKNOWN Not to put you on the spot , but What did you say your title was again ? 
UNKNOWN E No no , uh uh . 
UNKNOWN N n Uh , I'm your Industrial Designer , so i b well , the point is that well maybe I dunno . 
UNKNOWN You're the the Industrial Designer . 
UNKNOWN The shape is perhaps not the most ideal . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN As as stable as it is , there must be a compromise between um stability and design here , so . 
UNKNOWN Well I I suppose that things become design . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN But I mean i I was trying to think of like the design of others . 
UNKNOWN I can't think of anything other than a long rectangle for remote , maybe small , sort of fatter ones , but there's nothing being done sort of out of left field , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It's not new , it's not innovative , it's you know , everybody does long remote because it's easy , it's it's stable um . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN 'Kay , I'll drawsomething . 
UNKNOWN So if no , go ahead . 
UNKNOWN What ? 
UNKNOWN My idea was just to have it be kind of like a keyboard type shape , you know , like video games l so . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But maybe I mean that would be kinda big and bulky . 
UNKNOWN We could also try to do the hinge thing , so it could like flip out that way . 
UNKNOWN I don't know . 
UNKNOWN That's my idea . 
UNKNOWN I think definitely doing something different is a good idea . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN I mean maybe design something , that's sort of like uh I suppose not everybody's everybody's hand's the same , but something that would maybe fit in the hand easier . 
UNKNOWN Something with a grip . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , with a grip . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Because even I suppose even with the ball it's it might not be the easiest to hold onto um . 
UNKNOWN It still might be hard to it still not the ho easiest thing to hold , yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN So perhaps the the joystick the the keyboard idea might work better . 
UNKNOWN Like yeah . 
UNKNOWN But then again , people like to use one hand to flip and one hand to hold their soda , so maybe maybe we I feel like I'm just shooting everything down here . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN True . 
UNKNOWN It's d yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think it's definitely got to be a a one-handed a one-handed job . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Uh um Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION That's fine . 
UNKNOWN You're the boss , you're allowed to . 
UNKNOWN Well with the one-handed design you also have the the problem of the size w 'cause you know from cell phones , they can be too small . 
UNKNOWN So if the remote is too small it if it's small it probably looks better , but may not be th as functional . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So for that there's So The question is also , I dunno , d do you really always want to open that thing when you have to use it ? 
UNKNOWN Okay , so unfortunately we've got about five minutes here to come up with our um remote control idea and start rolling with it . 
UNKNOWN Um we've talked about our experiences with remote control and um we've got a couple ideas um . 
UNKNOWN Let's see here . 
UNKNOWN What if we had what if we had not only um say we went with the ball the ball function um , but maybe we give it sort of grips along the side s um to make it easier to hold on to . 
UNKNOWN So you know um s so it's easier to hold onto that way . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Course that'll then remove some of our our ball . 
UNKNOWN Unless this unless this part were raised , so say the cover flips over and covers that part . 
UNKNOWN So the grip is No , that wouldn't work either um . 
UNKNOWN But if we're gonna make it flat on the bottom , then that eliminates our ball anyways . 
UNKNOWN So if it were flat on the bottom and then had the sorta grips on the side here I guess , um and then flat uh And then we have the problem with the hinge . 
UNKNOWN So if we're flat on the bottom , it's not gonna roll away , it'll stay where we want . 
UNKNOWN Mm , that's true . 
UNKNOWN It's probably going to lie around opened all the time anyway , so I don't know if a lid is a good idea . 
UNKNOWN From stabil stability point of view uh it certainly is , but also you have to face it and take into account the more of these things break by accident , uh the more we sell . 
UNKNOWN So it's don't make it too stable uh . 
UNKNOWN So we don't have it flip open . 
UNKNOWN We just have a ball Okay , so then we forget the ball . 
UNKNOWN But then maybe to go back to the to th s something along those things then . 
UNKNOWN To the other design . 
UNKNOWN It looks cool . 
UNKNOWN Looks cool though . 
UNKNOWN It looks cool , but it's really not it's not functional um . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh functional . 
UNKNOWN So we've got our sort of keyboard kind . 
UNKNOWN What if we flipped it around here , so that it were um Sorry , that doesn't look anything like what you had there . 
UNKNOWN Um so it's up and down , you hold it this way . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Course then it's it's like the rectangular again , only with a couple of jutting out points . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN But it's one-handed um . 
UNKNOWN Question is what makes those game pads functional ? 
UNKNOWN W I think that's pretty much the form for full hand . 
UNKNOWN So it's a round shape underneath that makes it comfy , right , makes it nice , so that's the essential part . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Except for that I think we'll not probably not get a get away from some longer design . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN 'Cause you also have to know which way around to point this thing . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , because it doesn't have a cord , like joysticks do . 
UNKNOWN You know , all that dif batteries right , and Batteries go weak as well , so um after a while you have to point it towards the uh towards the equipment you wanna control with it , right ? 
UNKNOWN So , have to m show which is the front , which is the back . 
UNKNOWN Is it possible to have it to where it would work with a like a sensor on either side ? 
UNKNOWN So that either way you're pointing it it would work . 
UNKNOWN I suppose you could do that . 
UNKNOWN O of course the more technology you stick in that , the more it'll cost , so . 
UNKNOWN More expensive and yeah . 
UNKNOWN Course you can do that . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN Um True . 
UNKNOWN I mean of course it'll be evident after a while or if you look at it , it'll it'll be evident which way around to point it , since you have the the numbers and the and the the buttons and stuff , but um it's rather about an instinctual thing , like you just grab it , you don't have to s look at it , you know , which way around to point it . 
UNKNOWN Put it Even if you designed it in some in a way that you know , isn't a rectangle , but still pointed in a direction that had definite points . 
UNKNOWN Otherwise the design of or the the point of putting two sensors on both sides um would probably work . 
UNKNOWN So if that's your thing and you got something like that instead , and there's your s you kn you know which way you're gonna pointing it . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN Sorry to interrupt , but we have a warning to finish . 
UNKNOWN Um Does it say what does it say for n it says on there what we need to do for the next meeting , I think . 
UNKNOWN Are we out of time ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Okay , well , just to finish up , should we s go with this plan , start making some Are good ideas , what are not . 
UNKNOWN Let's . 
UNKNOWN Obviously Alright . 
CONFUSION Uh . 
UNKNOWN Must finish now , so . 
UNKNOWN T Uh , uh , um . 
UNKNOWN And then marketing will look and see what uh what people want . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Great . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN And Project Manager will design a better meeting for next time around , be a little bit more prepared . 
UNKNOWN And uh alright , good meeting . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN Du Uh we yes s I've lo I've done the role that I was asked to do anyway . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Thanks for coming to this meeting . 
UNKNOWN Hm . 
UNKNOWN S how we doing on our remote ? 
UNKNOWN We have some we have some ideas and some uh ideas for what people want . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think . 
UNKNOWN Alright let's just go over the agendareal quick for this meeting . 
UNKNOWN See if I can't get things uh moving along here a little bit better . 
UNKNOWN Um I'll go over what we went over last time , which shouldn't take long . 
UNKNOWN Then I believe each of you have a presentation. 
UNKNOWN Um I've was sent a a couple more requirements for our remote , what they want . 
UNKNOWN Um then we can come to a conclusion on uh what we want the remote to do , um and how it's going to do it hopefully . 
UNKNOWN And uh then we'll have the closing . 
UNKNOWN Um which we'll have forty minutes for . 
UNKNOWN Uh let's see , the last meeting we went over um who was responsible for what . 
UNKNOWN I'm responsible for leading the meetings , keeping the notes, uh and coming up with the final presentation. 
UNKNOWN Um Corinne is our Marketing Expert . 
UNKNOWN She's gonna figure out what what um the consumer wants . 
UNKNOWN Um Ryan is our User Interface Designer . 
UNKNOWN And Manuel is the Industrial Designer . 
UNKNOWN So you're gonna come up with the ideas Ryan , and you're gonna pick 'em apart . 
UNKNOWN Um we decided our remote , uh we want it to be a universal remote uh that everyone would want . 
UNKNOWN Um we want to be modern , um fun , different . 
UNKNOWN Uh it needs to be sturdy , um easy to find , so we gonna have that locator function . 
UNKNOWN Um and we want to be different . 
UNKNOWN Um and then we went over a couple of different ideas . 
UNKNOWN Ball-shaped phone . 
UNKNOWN The keyboard shape . 
UNKNOWN Um we decided that it should probably be one-handed . 
UNKNOWN Something we could use with one hand . 
UNKNOWN Um and that was our last meeting . 
UNKNOWN So um why don't um Do each of you have a presentation? 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN I'll hand it off to you and um Does anyone do you wanna go first ? 
CONFIRMATION Sure . 
UNKNOWN So we can maybe see what uh what the people want . 
UNKNOWN What was it ? 
UNKNOWN Function ? 
UNKNOWN Eight . 
UNKNOWN F_ eight ? 
UNKNOWN F_ eight . 
UNKNOWN Well . 
UNKNOWN How do I get it Oh right right right . 
UNKNOWN Slideshow . 
UNKNOWN To go to the next one ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah you click on that guy . 
UNKNOWN That one ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
UNKNOWN Well , this is my report, which is going to be based pretty much on a survey that I was sent . 
UNKNOWN Oh gosh , I've no idea . 
UNKNOWN G Okay . 
UNKNOWN Just press the arrow keys I think . 
UNKNOWN Usually goes to it . 
UNKNOWN Sorry I actually need to see something else on my screen . 
UNKNOWN Hit F_ eight again . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think . 
UNKNOWN And then ? 
UNKNOWN Again ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN You want it to be on both screens , or just just yours ? 
UNKNOWN No I want something else on mine . 
UNKNOWN Is that possible ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah but I think you have to hit escape . 
UNKNOWN And then you can Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay but now you don't have that . 
UNKNOWN Oh hit F_ eight again . 
UNKNOWN Sorry guys . 
UNKNOWN I know . 
UNKNOWN I did the same thing . 
UNKNOWN And then it should come up here shortly . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN So is there no way I can give you the slideshow and have something yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think oh give us the slideshow and something on your screen ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Oh well . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN I'm not sure . 
UNKNOWN You could maybe minimise that screen and then have them both up at the same time I think . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It's okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um so first of all , the method that I used was by doing some marketing research , by um doing research on some interviews that were conducted . 
UNKNOWN And then some internet research . 
UNKNOWN And I was sent a reportthat was I think there were a hundred remote users that they interviewed . 
UNKNOWN And so I will show you some of the results from that , which I think will be helpful . 
UNKNOWN Um okay here are some of the findings . 
UNKNOWN They said that the users dislike the look and feel of their current remote controls . 
UNKNOWN And seventy five percent of the users find their remote controls to be ugly . 
UNKNOWN Which is a fairly significant number I would say . 
UNKNOWN And eighty percent of the users would be willing to spend more money if they could get a remote that would look fancy . 
UNKNOWN So I think that earlier we were onto something when we were talking about having it be a modern cool look , I think that's definitely important . 
UNKNOWN Um they say that current remote controls do not match well the operating behaviour of the user . 
UNKNOWN Seventy five percent of users said they zap a lot . 
UNKNOWN And if anyone could clarify what that means ? 
UNKNOWN Zap , does that just mean like changing the channel ? 
UNKNOWN Is is it j just just just using it yeah . 
UNKNOWN Just jus yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um and fifty percent of the users say that they're only using ten percent of the buttons on their remote control . 
UNKNOWN And there was something else , they kept track of the frequency per hour in using certain buttons . 
UNKNOWN And some of them it looks like barely need to be included at all . 
UNKNOWN Of course channel selection is used the most frequently . 
UNKNOWN And then teletext was the next . 
UNKNOWN Volume and then power . 
UNKNOWN And then audio settings and screen settings and channel settings were practically never used . 
UNKNOWN So I think we could definitely eliminate or somehow combine a lot of the functions into one button . 
UNKNOWN Um the biggest user frustrations , as we said fifty percent of people find that their remotes are lost somewhere , and so I think a tracking device of some sort would be a good idea . 
UNKNOWN They said it take thirty four percent said it takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote . 
UNKNOWN And twenty six percent said that the controls are bad for R_S_I_ . 
UNKNOWN A repetitive strain injury . 
UNKNOWN What is it ? 
UNKNOWN Just repetitive strain injury . 
UNKNOWN I think . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN That's what I guess . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN And so bas okay . 
UNKNOWN Um as far as speech recognition goes , um the younger group looks like they're all for it . 
UNKNOWN From the fifteen to twenty five age group over ninety percent said they would pay more . 
UNKNOWN And it kind of just went down incrementally . 
UNKNOWN The groups at the older they get it looks like the less willing they are to pay , so maybe we could discuss this and think and decide if we think it's worth investing in this . 
UNKNOWN At least if we're targeting the younger groups . 
UNKNOWN And so in conclusion . 
UNKNOWN Some things that I drew from this are that I think we were correct . 
UNKNOWN We definitely need to focus on a new modern appearance , since so many people seem to be concerned about the ugliness of their remote control . 
UNKNOWN Um a multifunctional remote could be a good thing to explore . 
UNKNOWN So you only have one rather than five different remotes sitting all over your room . 
UNKNOWN Uh we need to simplify the remote and reduce the number of buttons , get rid of the ones that don't seem to be serving much purpose . 
UNKNOWN And then lastly I thought that maybe we could discuss the idea of speech recognition . 
UNKNOWN And that's it . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
CONFIRMATION Very nice . 
UNKNOWN Now we actually have some ideas of what what people want , what we should focus on . 
UNKNOWN Uh Wait can I look at that real quick ? 
UNKNOWN Oh yeah . 
UNKNOWN . 
UNKNOWN Sorry did you guys get time to write everything that you needed ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN Having just listened to what Corinne just said , I'll drawon some of the things as well . 
UNKNOWN Some things that sort of relevant to what I wanna say . 
UNKNOWN 'Kay so I'm just gonna yeah approach the technical functions design . 
UNKNOWN Um the method I used was to explore the uh technical functions of a remote control . 
UNKNOWN And t s simplest approach that I came to is is to change , programme and operate an electronic device remotely . 
UNKNOWN I mean that's an obvious thing to say , but it's not attached to the device that you want to control . 
UNKNOWN Um I had some things sent to me . 
UNKNOWN Not very much . 
UNKNOWN To look at similar devices . 
UNKNOWN Um defined in some them . 
UNKNOWN And then the personal preferences that I will suggest . 
UNKNOWN Um we discussed a universal one . 
UNKNOWN Um like it's just been brought up again then . 
UNKNOWN But I think a universal remote control is actually quite a difficult object to design , and po possibly within maybe the budget that we do it , um because you'd need to know all the spef specifications of a all the like electronic companies . 
UNKNOWN I'm not sure have you ever come across a universal remote control yourself , but you have to i they're a nightmare to use . 
UNKNOWN You have to set them , reset them to everything . 
UNKNOWN Um and that would only add buttons . 
UNKNOWN Whereas I think the aim is to take away buttons . 
UNKNOWN So I think it'd be better maybe to concentrate on maybe just a universal one for T_V_s . 
UNKNOWN Um or maybe just one that you could we could design and then different people , manufacturers could use it to set to their specifications , if if the aim is to get something that's unique in design . 
UNKNOWN Um Okay here here's just two pictures of remote controls . 
UNKNOWN They're just simple T_V_ remote controls . 
UNKNOWN But one is uh user-centred . 
UNKNOWN That is the one on the left . 
UNKNOWN And you can straight away see there's less buttons . 
UNKNOWN And the other one is engineer-centred where that's more uh specified for the sort of the elaborate piece of equipment it's trying to control um which appeals more to the product that we want , and on what the have said and the market research and stuff probably looking at something that should be user-centred . 
UNKNOWN Fewer buttons , simpler to use , and if ten percent um is hidden away if ten percent is what's used , maybe the other fifty percent , the buttons that are used very rarely like programming , they could be hidden maybe under some remote controls you might have come across have maybe a little flip thi thing where they're hidden away . 
UNKNOWN And the main buttons are the ones you or the ones you come across . 
UNKNOWN Um and finally , um uh sort I've sort of covered that , our product I think should be user interface orientated . 
UNKNOWN Um Like I said to concentrate on T_V_ remote control , a universal remote might be too complex . 
UNKNOWN Um and as what it , the major findings market researchers have said , it's the image and the appearance that people di dislike . 
UNKNOWN So that we should concentrate on something that would set a trend . 
UNKNOWN And then and change the fashion of remote controls . 
UNKNOWN And that's it . 
UNKNOWN cable there . 
THANKS Thank you . 
UNKNOWN What was your last conclusion on that one ? 
UNKNOWN Focus on uh the i the image of it . 
UNKNOWN On something on the image of it . 
UNKNOWN Uh the f the actual design . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN Good . 
UNKNOWN Good . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Gonna talk to you about the working design of the interiors basically which is what dictates the design the both the interface basically and the outer appearance because this is all the stuff that needs to go in there . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN So unfortunately the people who were supposed to do this little presentationfor me obviously were too drunk to actually accomplish it , so um I'm going to do a lot of the stuff on the board . 
UNKNOWN Um just This is the basic basic premise of a remote control . 
UNKNOWN Um the basic function is to send messages to another system . 
UNKNOWN Okay so much is clear . 
UNKNOWN An energy source feeds an integrated circuit , like a chip , that can compose messages . 
UNKNOWN Often in the form of infrared bits . 
UNKNOWN This is the most mostly used . 
UNKNOWN Um there's uh also some sound systems but infrared is the better or the more more used system . 
UNKNOWN Um parts are cheaper as well . 
UNKNOWN A user interface controls the chip and accordingly the messages . 
UNKNOWN This is where my people screwed up basically . 
UNKNOWN So I'm going to explain that on the board rather . 
UNKNOWN Um what we have is different components that obviously need to go in there . 
UNKNOWN We'll start with an energy source . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Um which is usually a battery right ? 
UNKNOWN Since it's not feasible to add a cable to that . 
UNKNOWN This energy source of course is connected to the the user interface itself . 
UNKNOWN Uh which can be buttons , whatever , which in fact controls a chip . 
UNKNOWN Right ? 
UNKNOWN This is the user interface and there we have the chip . 
UNKNOWN Um the way this goes normally is that this chip then controls an infrared lamp . 
UNKNOWN That sends out the signal . 
UNKNOWN Of course the signal differs accordingly . 
UNKNOWN Um depending on what the chip tells the infrared lan lamp . 
UNKNOWN And Of course that's controlled , the chip itself is controlled by the user interface . 
UNKNOWN The way you normally normally do it is that you add a little device such as a lamp to the whole thing as well , so that you know that it's working basically . 
UNKNOWN You press something , you get a response . 
UNKNOWN Which is also comparatively um important on one of those devices . 
UNKNOWN Now this , what we're talking about here , or what I think should be discussed are these two components mostly . 
UNKNOWN The the uh energy source for one thing can be altered . 
UNKNOWN What we probably cannot alter is of course the infrared , the sending device basically , the infrared lamp . 
UNKNOWN We cannot change the chip which controls the infrared lamp . 
UNKNOWN Right ? 
UNKNOWN These two are components that we have to use , and these are dictated by the whole function of the whole thing . 
UNKNOWN Um the lamp can be put onto the desi the device . 
UNKNOWN It c it doesn't have to be there . 
UNKNOWN This can be discussed as well . 
UNKNOWN The user interface . 
UNKNOWN That's something we can also discuss . 
UNKNOWN Um as we've heard uh speech recognition is the hype obviously in the moment . 
UNKNOWN Speech recognition um interface , we don't know that . 
UNKNOWN Or if we just do the usual button thing . 
UNKNOWN Or we have a touch pad or something like that that's something we can discuss . 
UNKNOWN And of course the energy source . 
UNKNOWN Batteries . 
UNKNOWN Solar cells . 
UNKNOWN Who knows ? 
UNKNOWN Of course it's always a question whether these these components are in fact available cheap enough , developed enough . 
UNKNOWN But that's like I s I suppose rather up to marketing , and not to to the industrial design department . 
UNKNOWN So we could the the the more complex we make it of course , the more expensive But people have said that they would well younger generations of people have said that they would pay more for a speech recognition remote . 
UNKNOWN Expensive it's gonna be get uh . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So possibly it might be worth the investment . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN I think speech recognition was uh one of those things where um they have to be really good for them to work . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause sometimes you find yourself just saying things over and o if it's on your phone . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I agree . 
UNKNOWN And you need to sort of take into light languages and then different dialects I suppose as well . 
UNKNOWN Well I myself I find , when you , h when there's something like spee speech recognition . 
UNKNOWN Like uh you call on the phone and you try to change your telephone or power or something . 
UNKNOWN Sometimes they have a a speech recognition on the other end , and you say one for this , and you find yours , like you said , saying the same thing over and over and over . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I find myself , especially if I'm in a crowd of people , looking really silly . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So maybe if you're sitting on your couch with a bunch of people then you know , you Volume up . 
UNKNOWN And wou I don't know if would would you want to keep saying stuff if you were watching stuff . 
UNKNOWN If you were watching something would you sort of be wanting Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Volume down . 
UNKNOWN Change the channel , you know channel up , channel down ? 
UNKNOWN I I don't know . 
UNKNOWN Another thing about these figures is ninety one percent of the youngest age groups said they'd do it , but probably a lot of them that's actually their parents money . 
UNKNOWN Like I don't know if they would actually go out and purchase this themselves , a fifteen year old you know . 
UNKNOWN I think As well it'd be j the gimmick factor for the younger people . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But practically I don't think it's Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It's a , it's a gimmick factor that they like at first , and Okay . 
UNKNOWN It'll wear off . 
UNKNOWN Gets old yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um Let's see here . 
UNKNOWN Do you wanna put your cord back in ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah I guess so . 
UNKNOWN Oh right . 
UNKNOWN Trade you . 
UNKNOWN go . 
UNKNOWN Now I was sent a couple of things to modify our uh new requirements . 
UNKNOWN Um the remote's only gonna be for the television , which is good because we already decided y your your research showed that uh not only is a universal remote more complicated , it's more cost , more costly . 
UNKNOWN And your re uh research showed that you know most of the people don't even use it . 
UNKNOWN I think uh you said fifty percent of the people only use half the or ten percent of the buttons . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN So if we remove the universal remote then that solves that problem . 
UNKNOWN Um no teletext . 
UNKNOWN Um So we don't have to worry about that . 
UNKNOWN Um but we do have to use the the company wants us to incorporate the corporate colour and our slogan , which is we put the fashion in electronics . 
UNKNOWN And our corporate colours are grey and yellow . 
UNKNOWN And we could probably get away with black too but So those are the three um the three new requirements that that I was told we need to use . 
UNKNOWN Um from all all three of your uh presentations, I think that we were on the right track a lot in our last meeting . 
UNKNOWN Um We want something that looks good . 
UNKNOWN Um we want something that's simple . 
UNKNOWN We want something that you can find easily . 
UNKNOWN Um And the speech recognition I I guess is kind of uh give or take . 
UNKNOWN It's gonna cost more . 
UNKNOWN S the young the younger people say that they like it . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN But um it's probably , I would say , probably not worth the investment at this point in time . 
UNKNOWN So maybe we should just do away with speech recognition . 
UNKNOWN Um And that way we can focus on our form . 
UNKNOWN I did have have a thought about the sort of the tracking thing . 
UNKNOWN Is that if it came with maybe a holder or holster , whatever you wanna call it . 
UNKNOWN Um that you you should put it back in . 
UNKNOWN Your remote . 
UNKNOWN But if you don't put it back in , you press something like a little button on that , and that just sort of sends out a beep to find where it is or something . 
UNKNOWN Just by infrared . 
UNKNOWN That shouldn't be too complex I would've thought . 
UNKNOWN That'd be , that'd be good if we were going with our our ball . 
UNKNOWN Yeah it would be quite good . 
UNKNOWN The ball could sit on a Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Or or with you know I guess with any form that that would be good . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN You know that could be the charger . 
UNKNOWN For you know we could use rechargeable batteries in the remote . 
UNKNOWN And that would be or solar . 
UNKNOWN Or you know However , however you wanted to go about it , the holder could also be the charging unit . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um With the locator button . 
UNKNOWN Um and if it were the ball you'd no longer have to have a flat space on it . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um like if we still have the how to hold on to it and It's gonna roll away . 
UNKNOWN Well you still do . 
UNKNOWN You s you still W yeah . 
UNKNOWN You put it on t on the couch table . 
UNKNOWN While you're watching , it's gonna roll off . 
UNKNOWN Rolls away yeah . 
UNKNOWN So that's not an issue really . 
UNKNOWN Um So I guess after the meeting we'll have some questionnaires . 
UNKNOWN And uh and some summaries for for what's going on . 
UNKNOWN Um then we'll take lunch . 
UNKNOWN Then we can come back and uh work on our individual work . 
UNKNOWN Um I'll do the minutes. 
UNKNOWN Uh let's see . 
UNKNOWN It looks like you're already on your way for uh working with the components . 
UNKNOWN Um chips , the what chips we need and what uh you know how to power it and whatnot . 
UNKNOWN . 
UNKNOWN User interface concept , we want it to be something simple . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um Minimal number of buttons . 
UNKNOWN I guess our , I guess our main um main thing that we should focus on until then is probably deciding on a certain look , you know . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN That's Mm . 
UNKNOWN Did you have time earlier to to work on that . 
UNKNOWN Did you guys feel you have enough time in between our meetings to get everything done that you need to get done ? 
UNKNOWN Not really . 
UNKNOWN I'll yeah I'll have a look , try look at the actual appearance in the next break . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN I th I I do still think it needs to be something that is ultimately one-handed . 
UNKNOWN The ball is probably not a good idea . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN And even something that's held like that might be difficult . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So that I think it still has to be a variation . 
UNKNOWN On maybe a a rect on a rectangle but maybe not necessarily as boring , as plain as a rectangle . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Um Shall we maybe shoot for a a specific uh target group ? 
UNKNOWN That way we could l I mean if it were , if we were shooting for young guys then it's um a certain look to the remote . 
UNKNOWN Or girls or older people ? 
UNKNOWN Um Would that you think that would help us find um a specific form ? 
UNKNOWN That we would would wanna pick out ? 
UNKNOWN D I don't know if that might cope with like the trend-watching . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN I find anything more on that . 
UNKNOWN Yeah not yet but maybe by the next meeting we'll have some info on that . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN So um we know that the remote's gonna have to be we'll just say we've got a colour scheme for it . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um yellow and you know yellow it's nice and bright , with the buttons being grey or black . 
UNKNOWN And our slogan pasted somewhere on it , on the the bottom or the you know . 
UNKNOWN Bottom perhaps yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um Maybe we could sketcha so basically all of our remotes all of our typical remotes now are just kind of a rectangular sort . 
UNKNOWN You know . 
UNKNOWN Um maybe we could flare it or something . 
UNKNOWN You know . 
UNKNOWN So it's more of course this will look like a bone then . 
UNKNOWN go ahead and erase this . 
UNKNOWN Um Hope everyone memorised that uh Yeah . 
UNKNOWN You I mean it might be to look at sort of the the shape and trend of like things like mobile phones , and the shapes that the they've been going . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN They've gone from big brick block things , which is a remote control is , to sort of slinky small things . 
UNKNOWN Yeah everybody's got a mobile phone right ? 
UNKNOWN Except for me now . 
UNKNOWN Uh But they are all , you know , mobile phones um they've kind of taken a turn to where they're really small . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um which may defeat our purpose for being able to locate our remote all the time . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN But then again you don't want you know like the first mobile phone that was this big and you had a handbag to carry it around in . 
UNKNOWN Um So we've got basically what remotes look like now is kind of what we're what we're stuck with . 
UNKNOWN Um Maybe we could go with a square or something . 
UNKNOWN Um Um you know with minimal number of buttons . 
UNKNOWN Hm . 
UNKNOWN I guess you've got you know one through nine . 
UNKNOWN For typing in your channels . 
UNKNOWN Uh you've got volume , up and down . 
UNKNOWN Channel up and down . 
UNKNOWN Power . 
UNKNOWN Power . 
UNKNOWN Usually at the top . 
UNKNOWN Um a mute . 
UNKNOWN That's the classical design . 
UNKNOWN That's that's pretty much all you need I think . 
UNKNOWN Um A menu button , maybe . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN So you know . 
UNKNOWN If you , if we want the remote to do other things like um or I guess the T_V_ to be able to change the tint and the colour and you know all those kind of things that are built into T_V_s , we just have that under one standard menu button where you go in , press the menu button , scroll up and down to select it . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um 'Kay so Um Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Talking of which maybe a scrolling function is not not too bad . 
UNKNOWN It's Talk about maybe f look at that from the side , there maybe . 
UNKNOWN Which is technically the easiest option . 
UNKNOWN Would probably be like a scrolling , little scrolling wheel like this . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Like a wheel on your mouse . 
UNKNOWN So . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , sort of like that . 
UNKNOWN Sort of . 
UNKNOWN You can even if we're coming from mice , we can even add a click function , where you , in order to verify the information you just press it down . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN 'S a good idea . 
UNKNOWN Also when it comes to the ergonomics of the whole thing , if you wanna make it square for the looks of it , then maybe to make it more comfortable to hold the whole thing , you add a little bulge down here . 
UNKNOWN Just which maybe from an engineering point this could be holding the the batteries and so on . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN I know . 
UNKNOWN You know what I'm getting at here , fel look at it from the side . 
UNKNOWN Look g yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Looks good . 
UNKNOWN It's like that . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Uh Then you hold it in your hand like this . 
UNKNOWN And maybe you bring the buttons nearer to the or the imp more important buttons nearer to the to the side . 
UNKNOWN Yes s To the thumb yeah . 
UNKNOWN To the thumb . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Maybe the buttons could like uh decrease in s the bigger ones you know they could actually be bigger in size than the ones that are less important , the smaller here . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN You can also have it , maybe , talking about mobile phones again , sliding open . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN With the lesser used functions on this part , and then it slidesinto that part . 
UNKNOWN Behind . 
UNKNOWN Definitely . 
UNKNOWN And out . 
UNKNOWN just like o on a sort of side view . 
UNKNOWN Something that you know it would sort of fit in the hand better . 
UNKNOWN So you know you just sort of have your hand Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Mm well I was just thinking , this this of course causes causes a problem um for left or right-handed people actually . 
UNKNOWN Right on the and your thumb would be up here type thing . 
UNKNOWN Yeah that's also true . 
UNKNOWN So . 
UNKNOWN instantly sort of always going for the right-handed person . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN But I mean the older so Right-handed , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah is everyone who in here's right-handed , left-handed ? 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN You guys all right-handed ? 
CONFIRMATION Right .
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So I'm left-handed but I , so I can say that most things are designed for right-handed people . 
UNKNOWN Uh-huh . 
UNKNOWN That's right . 
UNKNOWN Like the written language . 
UNKNOWN Or English . 
UNKNOWN Maybe you could buy like a special left-handed version of the remote . 
CONFUSION Maybe . 
UNKNOWN Ow . 
UNKNOWN Special order . 
UNKNOWN I would say I mean it should be probably designed for a right-handed p person . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um but that's that's good . 
UNKNOWN That's w I think we've got a kind of a good plan there . 
UNKNOWN Um At least for what buttons we're gonna use . 
UNKNOWN Um So we've got uh I like the scroll , the scroll action and the . 
UNKNOWN I mean I'm just just thinking maybe if it was um circular um with the sort of that sort of the sort of early idea we had , with the way that was more like that , whereas this is just a one-handed thing that you sort of almost wrap round the thumb . 
UNKNOWN So you'd have your , you'd put your hand into there with the thumb there . 
UNKNOWN And then your thumb would do you'd have all the buttons sort of round here . 
UNKNOWN And that I think could work . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN On any hand . 
UNKNOWN Kinda like holding a Yeah . 
UNKNOWN If you just had it like wrapped round there . 
UNKNOWN Left or right . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN That minimises it size-wise as well . 
UNKNOWN Minimise its size . 
UNKNOWN It could be you know really quite small . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Then there's maybe another point of making it a two-in-one kind of thing . 
UNKNOWN If we have a smaller a smaller device that actually fits into the big one . 
UNKNOWN You give it the full functions in here , and just a couple of functions in there . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Like your zap zapping device is just u channels up-down , uh volume , and on-off . 
UNKNOWN Zapping functions . 
UNKNOWN That's it . 
UNKNOWN Could be good . 
CONFUSION Maybe . 
UNKNOWN So two remotes in one . 
UNKNOWN But then would be easier to lose one or the other . 
UNKNOWN That's right . 
UNKNOWN Means the big one has to be sufficiently big . 
UNKNOWN And perhaps heavy , so you can't move it around . 
UNKNOWN Make it a piece of furniture . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah . 
UNKNOWN It actually is your coffee table . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN Yes , there you go . 
UNKNOWN Or a statue or something . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Well we need to finish up here . 
UNKNOWN Um So for the next So for the next um before the next meeting w uh sh shall we work on you're watching trends to see what what kind of new information we've got going on . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN Um Manuel you're going to work on the components for for what we're gonna use . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Let's go with our our uh rounded kind of fit in your hand let's explore uh the the uh possibility of having the two-piece . 
UNKNOWN So one for the the quick zapping um and possibly one you know with just that rounded part that fits into your hand . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um And Ryan you work on um how how well they'll work with the us with the user . 
UNKNOWN How well it'll work yeah . 
UNKNOWN So both of those concepts . 
UNKNOWN And uh okay I think we made some good progress here . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
UNKNOWN see you in I dunno . 
UNKNOWN I gu I guess we'll take lunch in about uh half an hour . 
UNKNOWN Or I guess we'll be taking lunch shortly and then then in about half an hour after that we'll probably have another meeting . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
UNKNOWN Is everyone here ? 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN This is our conceptual design meeting . 
UNKNOWN And I'll just take a few minutes and uh go through the previous minutes. 
UNKNOWN Um then each of you will have your presentation, um and then we will need to make a decision on the concept for the remote control . 
UNKNOWN And then we'll have uh forty minutes for finishing up . 
UNKNOWN Um I'll go through the mee through the minutesfirst . 
UNKNOWN Um , we just refreshed our our uh goal of making the finest remote control available . 
UNKNOWN Um we decided that , or we know that we need to use company colours , company logo . 
UNKNOWN Um and our Marketing Expert uh gave us some i uh information from interviews with a hundred different remote users . 
UNKNOWN Um with some statistics that backed basically what we were thinking before . 
UNKNOWN People thought their remotes were ugly , um um that remotes zap a lot . 
UNKNOWN Um they only use uh a finite amount of buttons . 
UNKNOWN Um and that they often lose the it's easy to lose a remote . 
UNKNOWN Um which were all things we were thinking we would wanna make it simple . 
UNKNOWN Um And uh some sort of locator . 
UNKNOWN Either a button or tracking device . 
UNKNOWN Um And that it should look different than what's out there . 
UNKNOWN Um Kind of mixed mixed response on the speech recognition . 
UNKNOWN The younger people said they wanted it , older people did not . 
UNKNOWN Um uh I think we decided that um the expense was not necessarily worth it , and that it was probably a gimmick , that um would increasingly wear on the consumers' nerves . 
UNKNOWN Um Then the User Interface Designer um explored some of the technical functions of the remote . 
UNKNOWN Um the simple versus the um the complex . 
UNKNOWN The simple one being better for a user , the complex better for an engineer . 
UNKNOWN Um Um and some personal preferences that were found in that would be that it should be a user-oriented remote , something simple . 
UNKNOWN Um and that we didn't wanna go with a universal remote , because uh increasing cost and increasing complexity . 
UNKNOWN Um we would just have a T_V_ remote . 
UNKNOWN Um and that we should also focus on the appearance of the remote . 
UNKNOWN Have it s be something that looks different . 
UNKNOWN And finally our um Industrial Designer uh gave us a rundown of how the remote will work . 
UNKNOWN Um from energy source , um uh what we would use . 
UNKNOWN Batteries because we don't wanna have a a cable . 
UNKNOWN Um How that would power the remote and the lamp . 
UNKNOWN If we were to to have one . 
UNKNOWN Uh um the user interface then would connect to a chip , which would work with the infrared controls uh to send the signal to the T_V_ . 
UNKNOWN Um I believe then we came up with a couple of ideas for what we think the design of the remote will be . 
UNKNOWN Um Um something that will fit into uh easily into someone's hand . 
UNKNOWN And with a , just a few buttons . 
UNKNOWN Just the basics . 
UNKNOWN And with a scrolling um function also . 
UNKNOWN Okay and I will leave that , leave it at that . 
UNKNOWN So Marketing ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN We're watching trends . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN Can I have your cable please ? 
UNKNOWN I suppose that you can have this . 
CONFIRMATION Thanks . 
UNKNOWN Okay so I was looking at trend-watching . 
UNKNOWN Um unfortunately I wasn't given too much information . 
UNKNOWN I was given a brief executive summary , and then an update on some recent fashion trends that we might like to look at . 
UNKNOWN And then I'll just tell you some personal preferences that I got from that . 
UNKNOWN Um okay the most important finding was that the fancy look-and-feel seems to be twice as important to the users as the current functional look-and-feel design , which I think we've kind of already discussed before . 
UNKNOWN Um the second most important finding was that the remote should be technologically innovative . 
UNKNOWN And again these are all things we've kind of already come up with on our own , but this just backs it up . 
UNKNOWN And thirdly the remote would be easy to use . 
UNKNOWN As far as fashion update , we've learned that fruits and vegetables will be the most important theme for cloths , shoes and furniture . 
UNKNOWN So that might be a bit of a challenge to incorporate this into our remote , but we can try . 
UNKNOWN Um and also , as opposed to last year , this year the material is expected to be spongy in feel . 
UNKNOWN Okay so from that um , as we've already said , we need to focus on a fancy look-and-feel . 
UNKNOWN Um I think we've already discovered that it's kind of hard to go away from the traditional rectangular design . 
UNKNOWN But I think that , even if it's very subtle , we need to kind of trick our consumers , so they at least get the idea that they're getting something that's new and modern and sleek and Whether it's through the shape or the colours or all of that . 
UNKNOWN Um for technologically innovative , we've talked about the tracking device . 
UNKNOWN We brought up the idea of having two pieces , which we could discuss further . 
UNKNOWN And Manuel had suggested um the energy source and the user interface , discussing some of those , um that we could change a little bit . 
UNKNOWN We need to keep it simple , have limited buttons , which I think the two piece idea might be really beneficial for . 
UNKNOWN Um we need to incorporate this fashion trend of fruits and vegetables . 
UNKNOWN I don't know , I mean I guess the two options are if we had our remote in the shape of a fruit or vegetable . 
UNKNOWN Oh it was sort of banana shaped . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN A banana shape ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Or with exterior designs. 
UNKNOWN But my question is , I mean the stereotypically speaking , you kind of picture males with their remote controls , and I'm not sure how they'd feel about having fruity logos on the outside . 
UNKNOWN So maybe we could have something that's somewhat removable , or I don't know , different options for female , male target groups . 
UNKNOWN And then the spongy feel . 
UNKNOWN I guess we could look at mobile phones and other technology that's out there . 
UNKNOWN C and look at different types of material that might please our users who want spongy-feeling remote controls . 
UNKNOWN So that's that . 
UNKNOWN So possibly like a uh , sorry , just to butt in for a second . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
UNKNOWN Possibly uh like a cover like they have for mobile phones ? 
UNKNOWN That's what I was thinking yeah . 
UNKNOWN Those like , yeah , sort of spongy ones . 
UNKNOWN You have one with a flag , and one with a banana and one that's a spongy feel to it . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So when you buy your remote you can buy various coverings . 
UNKNOWN You can Mm various covers . 
UNKNOWN What's it called ? 
UNKNOWN Cust you personalised , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Personalise your remote . 
UNKNOWN We could leave that to the cover department . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN We all know they've got nothing to do all day . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Why can't I see the crazy . 
UNKNOWN Um yeah I talking about the interface concept and how the customer relates to , will use the , consumer will use the actual device . 
UNKNOWN Um so I've looked at some of the stuff I was sent , um , try and get some inspiration . 
UNKNOWN But keep in mind that our own ideas that we had . 
UNKNOWN Um I was sent some information from the company saying that they , the technology department have devised a new speech recognition technology , where you can program questions into such devices . 
UNKNOWN They gave an example of a coffee machine where you program a question , you program the answer , and the machine responds accordingly . 
UNKNOWN Um okay . 
UNKNOWN There's different ways of a user can use products l like a remote . 
UNKNOWN Um there's a graphical use , where you you look at pictures and well on a screen . 
UNKNOWN A command line where you obviously type things in , and you get a response . 
UNKNOWN Um and then it ju that's just to point out the sort of inconsistent u sort of use of interface in remotes . 
UNKNOWN You can't really see that picture well , but there's various different remotes , once again with lots of different buttons on , making it more complicated . 
UNKNOWN So , then I had a look at new products that are on the market . 
UNKNOWN Not necessarily remote controls but ones that you'll recognise . 
UNKNOWN Um this is the voice , there is a voice recognition remote control , which can control mus multiple devices . 
UNKNOWN I have a there is a picture . 
UNKNOWN You surf your favourite channels uh with your voice . 
UNKNOWN Store up to eighty speech samples , controls four devices , T_V_ , cable , satellite , V_C_R_ , D_V_D_ and audio . 
UNKNOWN And you can record your own v verbal labels , that are connected to remote control functions . 
UNKNOWN So the technology is there . 
UNKNOWN Um the one on the left is very similar to what we drew up on the board in the previous meeting , where there has scroll down functions on the side . 
UNKNOWN You can sort of just make those out . 
UNKNOWN And then on the right is obviously an iPod , which is you know possibly one of the simplest things to use out there , and really is , and all that is is just a a nice big scroll menu that y you sort of go through . 
UNKNOWN That is a possibility . 
UNKNOWN And nothing's simpler really . 
UNKNOWN Um then there's things like this , which is a a a kid's remote , where the the parents have the facility to control and program what children can watch before . 
UNKNOWN So the remote control it o only allows them to access the channels that their parents want them to watch . 
UNKNOWN And um it means that th children have a novelty of having their own remote control . 
UNKNOWN So I don't know if there's a possibility of having one remote contr you know like we just had two components , maybe it can have more components you know , different remotes . 
UNKNOWN Um the point made at the end there here is that you have to be sort of be need to be clear on your um devices , as to what , you know , things you use . 
UNKNOWN Sometimes an arrow pointing down , which may suggest volume down , could become confused just as a V_ for volume . 
UNKNOWN Just little things like that , which would need to be made clear in the design . 
UNKNOWN Um I think , d carrying on from what I've already said , a user friendly remote with minimum buttons . 
UNKNOWN Maybe we've so suggested this two-part thing , where if it was to have a speech recognition thing , you could maybe control that on the do it or program all that on the control bit . 
UNKNOWN And then just have the simple sort of hand-held thing that we sort of devised earlier , as the actual remote . 
UNKNOWN Um I don't it could be a graphical display , the actual remote contr the actual control port maybe could have like an iPod where you just sort of control through the menus . 
UNKNOWN Stuff like gets more and more compli complicated . 
UNKNOWN And then the the hand-held bit should be ergonomically designed . 
UNKNOWN And that is it . 
UNKNOWN Why am I Oh yeah . 
UNKNOWN Just . 
UNKNOWN Where are we ? 
CONFUSION Uh . 
UNKNOWN Just to sort of show you . 
UNKNOWN M they've even got things like that . 
UNKNOWN Huge things . 
UNKNOWN Which is just for your gr ninety year old grandma yeah ? 
UNKNOWN That's industrial design for cranes , stuff like that . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Dunno . 
UNKNOWN And that yeah . 
UNKNOWN Makes sense , makes sense . 
UNKNOWN Notice the giant dog bone shape ? 
UNKNOWN Also good for animals . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN See . 
UNKNOWN things . 
UNKNOWN . 
UNKNOWN Why's my screen crazy ? 
UNKNOWN Uh Well let's see . 
UNKNOWN I'm going to bore you with a couple of descriptions of the interior . 
UNKNOWN Just to to make it more obvious what we have to fit in there , and that we do have to fit the stuff in there . 
UNKNOWN I've more information on possible materials um as well . 
UNKNOWN What we can and cannot do . 
UNKNOWN Um but let's just wait for this to load up and I'll show you what we're talking about here . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN The details of the components' design , as you can see there , what we have is the board , main board of the remote control . 
UNKNOWN The underside , that's pretty cheap piece of of technology really top left side you can see the chip , which is the , what we were talking about , this was is the device to recognise the signals the input , and it passes it on to a row of um further transistors and stuff like that on the right side that actually amplify the signal , which later on is being , is being transferred to a infrared lamp which then um of course shines infrared light onto the television which then will recognise what signal um it's getting and will do what you tell it . 
UNKNOWN Um So much for the the workings of the of the uh remote control itself . 
UNKNOWN Its job is to wait for you to press a key , then to translate that key press into infrared light signals , um that are received by the television . 
UNKNOWN When you press a key um you complete a specific connection . 
UNKNOWN The chip senses the connection and knows what button you pressed . 
UNKNOWN It produces a morse code line signal specific to that button . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Pretty clear . 
UNKNOWN Transistor amplifies the signal and then sends the m sends the signal to the L_E_D_ which translates the signal into infrared light . 
UNKNOWN The sensor in the T_V_ can see the infrared light , and seeing the signal reacts appropriately . 
UNKNOWN This is the circuit board from the other side . 
UNKNOWN Um the lower part of it , I don't know if you can see that properly , with the green greenish board is is what we what we saw in the first the first slidejust flipped over . 
UNKNOWN Um you can see the circuit board itself . 
UNKNOWN That's the cheapest uh way to make electronic connections basically on the market . 
UNKNOWN Um what you do is you have , don't have cables , but you have the connections actually in these in these lines on the on the board . 
UNKNOWN These are the actual keys that are being pressed . 
UNKNOWN They close the electric circuit . 
UNKNOWN That then sends the signal to the chip on the other side . 
UNKNOWN That would be behind here . 
UNKNOWN Um which uh sends it over to the transistors and all that stuff that amplify the signal and all that is being sent to the infrared lamp up there . 
UNKNOWN Now as you can see this is the the rubber button version of it . 
UNKNOWN Um the way it works is that you have the keys here . 
UNKNOWN The rubber button has a little metal uh plate on the other side , which closes the circuit here . 
UNKNOWN And thus gives on the signal . 
UNKNOWN Now this is the simple version . 
UNKNOWN Um we are talking um this this the simple and cheapest version at the same time . 
UNKNOWN We are talking something more complicated of course , it's going to be more expensive as well . 
UNKNOWN And not only that . 
UNKNOWN Um we are also restricted in the use of our outer shell , or in the material that we could use for our outer shell . 
UNKNOWN Um I've gotten some information that we could use for the case material plastic , rubber , as well . 
UNKNOWN Um rubber that is used in these anti-stress balls . 
UNKNOWN So it's pretty squishy . 
UNKNOWN That would that would serve that purpose . 
UNKNOWN Spongy ? 
UNKNOWN Um we could also use wood , or titanium . 
UNKNOWN What's the approximate per hundred thousand for the titanium ? 
UNKNOWN Oh fya I don't have an information on that . 
UNKNOWN However our company obviously can provide us with uh with the titanium , so I assume , I'm , I was given an okay to use it . 
UNKNOWN It certainly is an expensive material , I'm aware of that , but I was given an okay . 
UNKNOWN But there are certain restrictions to certain materials . 
UNKNOWN Now let's first go through the list with the materials . 
UNKNOWN So we what we can use is plastic , rubber , wood and titanium . 
UNKNOWN Can also mix these . 
UNKNOWN Um as for the energy source , um we were talking about that shortly in the other meeting . 
UNKNOWN Um what we could use is , or what I was offered , or what we could use , is a basic bateer battery . 
UNKNOWN Right ? 
UNKNOWN Uh a dynamo . 
UNKNOWN Interestingly enough . 
UNKNOWN Um we could use solar cells . 
UNKNOWN Or a device that was not n not further specified that provides kinetic energy . 
UNKNOWN Such as like watches you know . 
UNKNOWN Where you just move them m move the the actual device and this pr uh provides it with with uh some energy . 
UNKNOWN So um obviously I personally have to say that dynamo is out of the question really . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN You don't wanna wind up your remote control before you can use it right ? 
UNKNOWN Um solar cell is interesting . 
UNKNOWN May fail though , every here and there . 
UNKNOWN Would you have to leave it by the window ? 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Or you know you lose it , it lies behind the couch for a week and yeah mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Always the you But exactly . 
UNKNOWN Works well in Arizona but in Edinburgh not so No I think I think batteries are probably the way to go . 
UNKNOWN Y probably not yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um the kinetic energy thing um might work , um but the same problem . 
UNKNOWN You leave it lying around and you first have to shake it before it it starts to work . 
UNKNOWN So I'd say what we're stuck with really is um the basic battery . 
UNKNOWN Which also makes a base station basically obsolete . 
UNKNOWN We don't need that then . 
UNKNOWN Um However our interface options are push-buttons . 
UNKNOWN In which uh in the production of which or in manufacture of which um our company is expert . 
UNKNOWN Um However we've discussed that scroll wheels are a better option . 
UNKNOWN And they are possible . 
UNKNOWN We have an okay for scroll wheels . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um however when it comes to the scroll wheel of the iPod I've one big objection and that is that we have to fit an L_C_D_ into the remote control as well . 
UNKNOWN This however may exclude certain um materials . 
UNKNOWN If you have a squishy uh kind of remote control , then an L_C_D_ screen may be affected by the movement . 
UNKNOWN Hence we might not be able to put it in there . 
UNKNOWN So um There's also restrictions to , when it comes to the chip . 
UNKNOWN If we have a more sophistic uh sophisticated scroll wheel rather than this very basic uh set-up that we that I've just presented , um the chip has to be more s more sophisticated and thus more expensive as well . 
UNKNOWN I don't have any details to , when it comes to the cost but um it will be a significant difference . 
UNKNOWN I'd rather say drop the titanium and therefore let's have a more sophisticated chip , but that's not up to me to decide really . 
UNKNOWN So that's for the for the scroll wheel . 
UNKNOWN Um it limits our choice and squishy is hip , so I'd say rather not go for for that . 
UNKNOWN Let's see now . 
UNKNOWN Um um solar cells cannot be used on a curved or latex um surface or um remote control . 
UNKNOWN But obviously that's not our problem um since we have decided or against solar cells , I assume right ? 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Or is anybody still alright . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
NEGATION No . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh which makes it very conventional but therefore traditional I assume . 
UNKNOWN Um Um With the titanium um we cannot make it a curved design . 
UNKNOWN We would just be able to make it flat and and um yeah a straight design pretty much . 
UNKNOWN Which I assume would exclude uh some of the more sophisticated versions . 
UNKNOWN Would the sort of spongy and the the plasticky thing y you can get those mobile phones that initially have a it is plastic but then they have sort of a a s a cover on it which is just sort of soft and stuff . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Like a covering . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So I don't know if that would still be possible to have you know in plastic . 
UNKNOWN But then where do people hold it ? 
UNKNOWN Just all be sort of spongy . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN The we can have the fruits and vegetables on the spongy parts , so they can remove it . 
UNKNOWN So you as the the possibility of having a a graphical display on it , like a screen ? 
UNKNOWN Like the iPod ? 
UNKNOWN You can have an L_C_D_ screen . 
UNKNOWN Um but therefore no rubber will be used . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Alright ? 
UNKNOWN So plastic yes , titanium yes , but this will of course influence the form . 
UNKNOWN With plastic , as I understand it , you can use any form . 
UNKNOWN Um latex is tricky . 
UNKNOWN Or rubber and um and titanium also seems to be tricky when it comes to the form . 
UNKNOWN So the way to go is if you want a scroll wheel you either make it flat and angular , uh add an L_C_D_ screen , and um then you can basically choose either plastic or titanium . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Or wood even . 
UNKNOWN Um if you wanna make it a particular shape , use plastic . 
UNKNOWN Add an L_C_D_ screen , add a scroll wheel , that'll be fine . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Or make it just push-buttons . 
UNKNOWN Basically plastic gives you the b biggest variety of of options . 
UNKNOWN Maybe not the nicest feel . 
UNKNOWN Or not much originality really . 
UNKNOWN So the ru wait the rubbery we can shape it however we want ? 
UNKNOWN Or the rubbery we cannot ? 
UNKNOWN With rubber we could uh sh pretty much shape it the way we wanted it , but we cannot add scroll wheels , and we cannot add an L_C_D_ screen . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN That's the tricky thing . 
UNKNOWN Could we not you know have a shape with a scroll and the screen , and then j just sort of that initial shape we had , just which is uh sort of banana-esque . 
UNKNOWN So that's thing if we did it yellow . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And um you know you just p stick on just sort of rubber things that that sort of grip the thumb bit . 
UNKNOWN They wouldn't have any they're just on the exterior . 
UNKNOWN They wouldn't be necessary to the actual shape of the thing . 
UNKNOWN Is that an option , a plastic shell with a rubbery coating on at certain spots ? 
UNKNOWN S Certainly can be done yes . 
UNKNOWN Um yeah . 
UNKNOWN if that doesn't affect the functional side of it all . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Like say just the underside or so then it can be done . 
UNKNOWN I assume . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So The fruit design um How about um affecting the surface of the actual um remote control ? 
UNKNOWN Say we don't make it p a particular fruit shape obviously , but uh give it like the surface of an orange , banana , whatever . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN You name it . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN What about a smell ? 
UNKNOWN Just design-wise . 
UNKNOWN T to the remote ? 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Nice one . 
UNKNOWN You could just sell it in different colours as well I suppose . 
UNKNOWN In different ye yellows . 
UNKNOWN Bright citrus colours yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN I don't suppose we have to stick to co Stick to the colours yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well we we're supposed to stick to the company colours though , that's yellow and grey . 
UNKNOWN Oh yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yellow and grey . 
UNKNOWN Yellow and grey . 
UNKNOWN So what have we , lemon , banana , is Grapefruit is what we'd go for , when it comes to the outer appearance perhaps . 
UNKNOWN Mm grapefruit . 
UNKNOWN Grapefruit . 
UNKNOWN But mm . 
UNKNOWN I would say , if I were to make a decision , I would probably put the fruit aspect at the lower lower end of the spectrum of of importance . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN . 
UNKNOWN Um Well perhaps the implied shape will be enough to lure that fruit-minded remote buyer . 
UNKNOWN I think having a shape could be a little ridiculous , like Well we kinda do yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well we have it banana-shaped already , kind of . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So Right . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And if it's yellow ? 
UNKNOWN and if it if it was done yellow , which is a company colour . 
UNKNOWN It's it's yellow . 
UNKNOWN I it's yellow . 
UNKNOWN It's curved . 
UNKNOWN Grey buttons yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well so why not add a couple of grey stripes and make it look like a banana ? 
UNKNOWN It's sort of couple of couple of grey stripes . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN We could put the grey stripes on the bottom so that that person could turn it over . 
UNKNOWN On the the gr the rubbery grips could be grey . 
UNKNOWN It would look like a banana just sitting on their table . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN There you go . 
UNKNOWN Rather than rather th Maybe the holder , if we were to have a holder , it could be shaped like a fruit . 
UNKNOWN It could and then you could actually h put the banana-shaped thing on the fruit bowl , on the coffee table , and then people would always know where it was . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN Nice . 
UNKNOWN Could look like a fruit bowl . 
UNKNOWN It could be an ape . 
UNKNOWN Could be , it could be an ape or a fruit bowl . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Hey we could have a variety of options here . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Do you have more to your presentation? 
UNKNOWN That's pretty much it . 
UNKNOWN I informed you about the materials , what the interior has to look like , and what the limitations to certain materials are on there you go . 
SURPRISE Oh .
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN I'm gonna plug in here real quick . 
CONFIRMATION Sure . 
UNKNOWN If I could . 
UNKNOWN Hang on . 
UNKNOWN There you go . 
UNKNOWN Like I said we have to make a decision on a couple of these items here . 
UNKNOWN Um ow . 
UNKNOWN Ow . 
UNKNOWN So is the two piece idea out ? 
UNKNOWN Or have we not decided ? 
UNKNOWN Well we sort of rid of that because gonna use a battery . 
UNKNOWN And the base station might not be necessary . 
UNKNOWN Oh right okay . 
UNKNOWN Well we can still design a two-piece uh remote um without having a base , having one of them be a base station , but just have it be an optional either big remote with lots of functions , or you take out the smaller piece . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN We can still do that . 
UNKNOWN However of course this would be like designing two remotes pretty much . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So um which then , as I understand it , would probably limit the , limit again the the the use of certain materials , because they would be too expensive . 
UNKNOWN Say like have a scroll wheel and uh on both of them , or have an L_C_D_ screen and so on so on . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN You'd probably have to stick rather with a just traditional rubber button design which we saw there . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN But could be done , of course . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Uh so these are the decisions that we do need to make by the end of this meeting . 
UNKNOWN Um for our components concept we need to come up with the energy source , um the chip-on-print , and the case . 
UNKNOWN Probably case um material . 
UNKNOWN And probably a shape also . 
UNKNOWN Um and then for the user interface concept we need to decide what the tape , what , what the type is . 
UNKNOWN And what kind of supplements we'll have . 
UNKNOWN Um Energy source I think we've , I think we've decided batteries , although not exciting , are probably our best bet . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN And we have five minutes . 
UNKNOWN Okay when it comes to the chip-on-print , as I said , the the more advanced features you want , um the fancier the chip has to be and the more expensive . 
UNKNOWN Uh if you want just a normal button version , the chip-on-print is gonna be a cheap one . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Right ? 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN So Um I guess we should pick the case then . 
UNKNOWN If we go with the plasticky case , or the the plastic case , um then the chip-on-print is still kind of , we could have either or . 
UNKNOWN We could have a complex one or a a non-complex . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But did we decide that the rubbery feel was important enough to us ? 
UNKNOWN Well what about what you said , like putting the finger grips just on top of the plastic ? 
UNKNOWN Just just maybe yeah . 
UNKNOWN . 
UNKNOWN Just a little bit of . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So we would , we would have the L_C_D_ screen ? 
UNKNOWN as long as the pla uh the rubber is nowhere near the controls , yes . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN So I guess the case would be plastic , with Perhaps that's not even enough rubber to qualify as being part of it . 
UNKNOWN It's more of a su it's more of a supplement maybe . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN M more of a l lamination perhaps . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So then for the scroll , are we going for the iPod type ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah I think so . 
UNKNOWN Yeah ? 
UNKNOWN I think . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Which will require a more expensive chip-on-print right ? 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN It does . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN So I guess that , is that , is that about it ? 
UNKNOWN So we have a good idea of what we're gonna need to to do on this ? 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Um okay so we will have another meeting in thirty minutes . 
UNKNOWN Um Here's what's gonna be going on . 
UNKNOWN Um Um Ryan you'll be working on the user interface design . 
UNKNOWN Um Manuel you'll be working on the look-and-feel design . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Corrine we'll want a product evaluation . 
UNKNOWN And the two of you get to play with the uh modelling components and uh maybe and and get us a prototype . 
UNKNOWN Which should go along well with your look-and-feel design and your interface . 
UNKNOWN So that basically just be working on the prototype , uh we'll accomplish your other two actions . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Let's do it . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN Soon as I get this . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN This is our last meeting . 
UNKNOWN Um I'll go ahead and go through the minutesfrom the previous meeting . 
UNKNOWN Uh and then we'll have a , the prototype presentation. 
UNKNOWN Um then we will um do an evaluation . 
UNKNOWN Uh or we'll see what , what we need to have under the criteria for the evaluation . 
UNKNOWN Then we'll go through the finance and see if we fall within the budget . 
UNKNOWN Um then we'll do the evaluation , and then we can finish up after that with um any changes that we'll need to make , or hopefully everything will fall right in line . 
UNKNOWN Um let's see , minutesfrom the last meeting . 
UNKNOWN Um we looked at uh the the trends . 
UNKNOWN We had uh the fashion trends that people want a fancy look-and-feel . 
UNKNOWN It was twice as important as anything else . 
UNKNOWN Um they liked fruit and vegetables in the new styles . 
UNKNOWN Um and a spongy feel . 
UNKNOWN So we were talking about trying to incorporate those into our prototype . 
UNKNOWN Um they wanted limited buttons and simplicity . 
UNKNOWN Um then we looked at the uh the method for coming up with our own remote . 
UNKNOWN Um looking at other other devices . 
UNKNOWN Um the iPod , we really liked the look of that . 
UNKNOWN Um we also had uh the kid's remote for a simple idea . 
UNKNOWN Um a two part remote , which was what were were originally looking at . 
UNKNOWN Uh and then um there was talk of spee uh speech recognition um becoming more uh predominant and easier to use . 
UNKNOWN But I think we've still decided not to go with that . 
UNKNOWN Then we looked at the components um the materials for the case , the different energy sources , the different types of chips , um and made a decision on what we were going to use to make our remote . 
UNKNOWN Um and basically how , what were making for the prototype . 
UNKNOWN So I'm going to leave it at that and let you guys take over . 
UNKNOWN The prototype discussion . 
UNKNOWN The prototype yeah . 
UNKNOWN Do you need a this ? 
NEGATION No . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN There is our remo the banana . 
UNKNOWN Can try to plug that in there but Right . 
UNKNOWN Um yeah basically we we st went with the colour yellow . 
UNKNOWN Um working on the principle of a fruit which was mentioned , it's basically designed around a banana . 
UNKNOWN Um but it would be held in such a fashion , where it is , obviously it wouldn't be that floppy 'cause this would be hard plastic . 
UNKNOWN These would be like the rubber , the rubber grips . 
UNKNOWN So that's so that would hopefully help with grip , or like the ergonomics of it . 
UNKNOWN Um but all the controlling would be done with this scroll wheel . 
UNKNOWN You have to use your imagination a little bit . 
UNKNOWN And this here represents the screen , where you , where you'd go through . 
CONFIRMATION Very nice . 
UNKNOWN And the the simplest functions would be um almost identical to an iPod , where that one way ch through channels , that way th other way through channels . 
UNKNOWN Volume up and down . 
UNKNOWN And then to access the more complicated functions you'd you sorta go , you press that and go through the menus . 
UNKNOWN It's that that simple . 
UNKNOWN That just represents the infrared uh beam . 
UNKNOWN That's a simple on and off switch . 
UNKNOWN Um I don't know , we could use the voice . 
UNKNOWN T that blue bits should be yellow , d that that'd be where the batteries would be I suppose . 
UNKNOWN And um that's about it . 
UNKNOWN It's as simple as you , we could make it really . 
UNKNOWN Is there anything you want to add ? 
UNKNOWN That's what we have there . 
UNKNOWN That's plastic . 
UNKNOWN Plastic covered with rubber . 
UNKNOWN We might uh add some more underneath here . 
UNKNOWN Maybe give it , give it a form . 
UNKNOWN I mean you're supposed to hold it like that , but um just if you grab it , take it from somewhere , so yeah , you have some rub yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Doesn't make much make much difference . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN You could work left-handed or right-handed I suppose . 
UNKNOWN Exactly , use both . 
UNKNOWN Might as well think about Th think about the button as well . 
UNKNOWN T the actual thing might be smaller . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Like either put either one one on either side or not do it at all . 
UNKNOWN What but what's that button ? 
UNKNOWN Just the on and off . 
UNKNOWN It's a quick on-off button . 
UNKNOWN Uh , 'kay . 
UNKNOWN That's um yeah I think it's pretty important . 
UNKNOWN So you don't have to fiddle with that . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN Right ? 
UNKNOWN Um that's not um I'd say a bit smaller would probably be nice . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN You wanna play with that over there . 
UNKNOWN There you go . 
UNKNOWN It's you know it's flimsy 'cause it's made out of heavy Play-Doh , but And whether or not it would fall into the cost everything I suppose . 
UNKNOWN Would you like to uh Well done . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Pretty impressive . 
UNKNOWN Kind of a banana . 
UNKNOWN With the scroll and the L_C_D_ . 
UNKNOWN Well luckily we are going to find out . 
UNKNOWN Or not luckily . 
UNKNOWN Um do you have a marketing presentationfor us . 
UNKNOWN I do . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN You guys are gonna help me do an evaluation of the criteria . 
CONFUSION Um . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So first I'll just discuss some of the criteria that I found . 
UNKNOWN Just based on the past trend reports that I was looking at earlier . 
UNKNOWN And then we'll do a group evaluation of the prototype . 
UNKNOWN And then we will calculate the average score to see how we did . 
UNKNOWN Um so the criteria we're gonna be looking at are the complaints um that we heard from the users who were interviewed earlier . 
UNKNOWN So we're gonna be doing it based on a seven point scale . 
UNKNOWN And one is going to mean true , that we did actually achieve that . 
UNKNOWN With seven being false , we did not achieve that . 
UNKNOWN . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So for the first one , we need to decide , did we solved the problem of the users who complained about an ugly remote ? 
UNKNOWN . 
UNKNOWN I think it's definitely different than anything else out there . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So if they think that what is out there is ugly , then yes I would say , I would say most definitely . 
UNKNOWN I would . 
UNKNOWN It's bright . 
UNKNOWN It's bright . 
UNKNOWN It's It's curved . 
UNKNOWN It still has your traditional black . 
UNKNOWN It's not there's no sharp angles to it . 
UNKNOWN Yep , not angular . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN I'd say , when it comes to the ergonomics , the form and stuff , yes that's definitely more beautiful than your average . 
UNKNOWN However the colour , we don't have a say in that . 
UNKNOWN Yeah I think the colours detract a little bit . 
UNKNOWN Some people might say it . 
UNKNOWN That has been , that has been dictated pretty much by the company . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN So uh to answer that honestly I would rather say like uh , we have not solved the problem completely with the ugly remote because the colour is ugly , definitely . 
UNKNOWN That's true . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN 'S nothing you can say about that . 
UNKNOWN I mean I much prefer something like brushed chrome with that form . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION But Right . 
UNKNOWN Yeah something more modern to go a a modern colour to go with the modern form . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN It's different . 
UNKNOWN You don't want your uh three feet huge L_C_D_ dis display in your living room that's hanging from the wall to be controlled with something like that . 
UNKNOWN Um okay so , do you think , since we This was a a sign criteria , do you think maybe we should put it somewhere in the middle then ? 
UNKNOWN Does that sound good ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN What do you think ? 
UNKNOWN Three ? 
UNKNOWN Four ? 
UNKNOWN I would say four . 
UNKNOWN Five ? 
UNKNOWN Four is fair . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Very non-committal , four . 
UNKNOWN Okay , the second one . 
UNKNOWN Did we make it simple for new users ? 
UNKNOWN It's very intuitive , I think yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think that was the main aim , one of the main aims that we had . 
UNKNOWN S give it a one . 
UNKNOWN One , 'kay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um , do the controls now match the operating behaviour of the users ? 
UNKNOWN Uh yeah . 
UNKNOWN I'd say that So one ? 
UNKNOWN 'Cause we've we've brought it down to basically four controls most common , which are channel and volume . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN And then the other ones are just a matter of just going , just scrolling further . 
UNKNOWN S scrolling through and selecting a few . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN So that's a one . 
UNKNOWN Yeah ? 
UNKNOWN I think that's a one . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Okay um the fourth one . 
UNKNOWN How about the problem of a remote being easily lost ? 
UNKNOWN One of the number one complaints . 
UNKNOWN Something that big and that yellow you just don't lose anymore . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Whether you want to or not , you're not gonna lose it . 
UNKNOWN It's bright yellow . 
UNKNOWN Bright yellow's hard to lose . 
UNKNOWN But um if we were to , if we were , that , the speech recognition . 
UNKNOWN That , we could maybe just use that solely for the the finding thing . 
UNKNOWN That was what we'd we'd mentioned . 
UNKNOWN So if we incorporate speech recognition into it then it could And it is quite bright and Uh Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Just just to use , to find it when it was lost . 
UNKNOWN But like I said , like I don't think you'd lose something so yellow so easily . 
UNKNOWN Oops . 
UNKNOWN And it's not gonna fall , like a rectangle would slip down behind things . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN That's gonna be a difficult shape to Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well what S Mm . 
UNKNOWN Maybe in the middle again , three or four or something ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN I mean you know loo losing things is one of those things that people can lose , I mean a million ways . 
UNKNOWN You can pick it up and walk away with it and then you've lost it . 
UNKNOWN That's true . 
UNKNOWN But if we do go with the , with the speech recognition , then it , then our scale goes up quite a bit I think . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Oh yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN You probably Mm . 
UNKNOWN Probably two . 
UNKNOWN You know . 
UNKNOWN If we eliminate the fact that you know it's impossible to guarantee that it's not gonna be lost then I'd say two . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN With the speech recognition , which of course may be changed depending on budget . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Y you could add an extra feature actually . 
UNKNOWN Which makes this thing raise hell when you remove it too far from the television . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN We could add that but that's nothing we have thought of so far . 
UNKNOWN Which , which may be cheaper than speech recognition if it were just a Some sort of proximity Pray that you don't accidentally lose that piece . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN Yeah true . 
UNKNOWN But I mean d just those whistling , clapping key rings you have . 
UNKNOWN Annoying alarm or something ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It's it's Um the it's based on this anti anti-theft technology for suitcases and stuff , where you have one piece that's attached to your luggage , another piece that starts beeping . 
UNKNOWN They're cheap . 
UNKNOWN So it can't be that expensive . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN That can't cost much . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So that can also easily be integrated because these things are small enough to to hide , so you have one piece , you have to glue somewhere behind your stick it behind your T_V_ and the other Right . 
UNKNOWN stick it on the T_V_ . 
UNKNOWN That'd be tough then . 
UNKNOWN Well also your remote would uh alarm you if somebody stole you t your television , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Ran off with it without taking the beautiful remote control . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So . 
UNKNOWN Are we adding one of these two features ? 
UNKNOWN Let's add one of those features and say yes . 
UNKNOWN gonna say okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So we're back to a one ? 
UNKNOWN Or a two ? 
UNKNOWN Two . 
UNKNOWN Two . 
UNKNOWN Two , 'kay . 
UNKNOWN Two . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Are we technologically innovative ? 
UNKNOWN Uh It's all just It's all just stolen technology when it comes down to right right right right . 
UNKNOWN I'd say so . 
UNKNOWN Uh don't get many mo remote controls with screens on . 
UNKNOWN Yeah it's stolen technology . 
UNKNOWN From iPod yeah . 
UNKNOWN It's But there's not a lot of yellow , there's not a lotta yellow . 
UNKNOWN But we have . 
UNKNOWN But for remotes yeah . 
UNKNOWN Course that wasn't really we were kinda forced to take that colour . 
UNKNOWN Fa 'cause it's stolen . 
UNKNOWN Two ? 
UNKNOWN Three ? 
UNKNOWN I don't know that we are that innovative , to tell you the truth . 
UNKNOWN No maybe not . 
UNKNOWN Yeah not really . 
UNKNOWN But how many remotes do you see like this ? 
UNKNOWN Not so many . 
UNKNOWN If we added the screaming factor then we go up . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Um I would say we're probably at four . 
UNKNOWN Really ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN That's gonna hurt us . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um spongy material ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah well you have that , kind of , sort of . 
UNKNOWN We have some spongy , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah as much as as needed , I think . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN It's not a one though . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN One would be the whole thing to fold and stuff . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Because it's only got what , these parts are the grips and perhaps the back side the bottom the underneath on the back . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So that's a four at most . 
UNKNOWN Probably a four at most . 
UNKNOWN And lastly , did we put the fashion in electronics ? 
UNKNOWN Possibly even a five . 
UNKNOWN Y yes . 
UNKNOWN I'd say we did . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN If your fashion is b is Carmen Miranda , you betcha . 
UNKNOWN More Well the recent fashion is rather displayed in the in the L_C_D_ and the way you operate it than the form and the colour , but it definitely is . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN On the Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It's true . 
UNKNOWN Be what we were told , and they'd say yeah , definitely . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
UNKNOWN Now we just gotta calculate . 
UNKNOWN Six eight twelve sixteen . 
UNKNOWN Seventeen divided by s Eight . 
UNKNOWN Seven is Two point two point four ? 
UNKNOWN . 
UNKNOWN Is that some long division ? 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN Well I haven't done math in years . 
UNKNOWN Something . 
UNKNOWN What two I dunno . 
UNKNOWN Just , I'm sure there's a . 
UNKNOWN Okay we'll say two point four two . 
UNKNOWN Right ? 
UNKNOWN How does that look ? 
UNKNOWN I'm impressed . 
UNKNOWN I can't do that without a calculator . 
UNKNOWN No I can't do long very impressive . 
UNKNOWN It's been a while . 
UNKNOWN And what what is the acceptable criteria ? 
UNKNOWN Is there like a scale that we have to hit ? 
UNKNOWN Oh no . 
UNKNOWN They just told me to pick my own criteria and have you guys evaluate it basically . 
UNKNOWN Alright then . 
UNKNOWN So that's that . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Well , let's see . 
UNKNOWN Now we get to do the budget numbers . 
UNKNOWN You didn't know that you were gonna have a budget . 
UNKNOWN But we do . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah so . 
UNKNOWN You'd been going a long time dividing that . 
UNKNOWN It's two point four two eight five se it just keeps going on . 
UNKNOWN Oh my god . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Two point four two basically . 
UNKNOWN Yeah we'll go with that . 
UNKNOWN Not too shabby . 
UNKNOWN So I have here an Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Fifty percent , you're kidding . 
UNKNOWN P It's too much . 
UNKNOWN We want a fifty percent profit on this . 
UNKNOWN Oh you can't really see that very well . 
UNKNOWN Charge about three hundred quid for it . 
UNKNOWN Twelve and a half Euros is what supposed to cost us . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so Well let's see . 
UNKNOWN Um Uh Battery . 
UNKNOWN The f the Wonder if I can make this What the Oh it won't let me do that . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Alright so at top , I don't know if you guys can read that or not . 
UNKNOWN I can't 'cause I don't have my glasses on , but so we've got the energy source . 
UNKNOWN There's uh four , five , six categories . 
UNKNOWN We have energy source , electronics , case . 
UNKNOWN Then we have case material supplements , interface type , and then button supplements . 
UNKNOWN Okay so Uh first of all energy source , we picked battery . 
UNKNOWN Um and how many batteries do we think this will probably take ? 
UNKNOWN Probably some e either two or four . 
UNKNOWN Two . 
UNKNOWN Two ? 
UNKNOWN Like it . 
UNKNOWN At four it's gonna be too heavy , so that that's not our problem . 
UNKNOWN People can change it every month . 
UNKNOWN They won't know until after they bought it . 
CONFIRMATION Excellent . 
UNKNOWN This is consumerism . 
UNKNOWN Alright so for the electronics our choices are simpl simple chip-on-print , regular chip-on-print , advanced chip-on-print , sample sensor , sample speaker . 
UNKNOWN . 
UNKNOWN We're advanced chip are we ? 
UNKNOWN That's the advanced chip-on-print , yeah . 
UNKNOWN 'Kay , we have one of those . 
UNKNOWN 'Kay then the case is a Probably it's double curved . 
UNKNOWN Double curved , yes . 
UNKNOWN Case materials are plastic . 
UNKNOWN Plastic . 
UNKNOWN Um I guess it's two , since one for the top , one for the bottom . 
UNKNOWN N no . 
UNKNOWN Is that right or is it just one ? 
UNKNOWN No that's just one . 
UNKNOWN Maybe it's one because of the 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN It's just one mo single mould , we can do that . 
UNKNOWN Yeah yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN I guess it doesn't matter 'cause the price on that one is zero , which is nice . 
UNKNOWN Exactly , right . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN Special colour ? 
UNKNOWN That's not a special colour . 
UNKNOWN Bright yellow . 
UNKNOWN It's a specially ugly colour , but it's not special . 
UNKNOWN Interface type . 
UNKNOWN We have pushbutton , scroll-wheel interface , integrated scroll-wheel pushbutton , and an L_C_D_ display . 
UNKNOWN S That's Yeah . 
UNKNOWN S Yes unfortunately . 
UNKNOWN So we actually have the L_C_D_ display and then is it the integrated or is it Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And then I'd say the integrated . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN Button supplement ? 
UNKNOWN Special colour ? 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Um special form ? 
UNKNOWN Special material . 
UNKNOWN We could of course make the buttons wood . 
UNKNOWN Say mahogany or so Mm-hmm or titanium . 
UNKNOWN It'd look really lovely . 
UNKNOWN Or titanium . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN They cost us all the same . 
UNKNOWN remote control . 
UNKNOWN Uh just Yeah that's too much . 
UNKNOWN Well we only have one button so really we shouldn't be charged , we shouldn't be charged anything for the the button supplements . 
UNKNOWN No that's getting a bit tiny . 
UNKNOWN Um Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I'd ignore that . 
UNKNOWN Leave it blank . 
UNKNOWN We're gonna leave that one blank because we run on a L_C_D_ and scroll . 
UNKNOWN So our total is fifteen point five . 
UNKNOWN Which I believe is by three Euros over . 
UNKNOWN It's hard to believe . 
UNKNOWN So we'll go for the hand dynamo huh ? 
UNKNOWN So the only thing better than um a banana-shaped remote is one that you shake . 
UNKNOWN If it w What if we completely took out the the one single button we've got on . 
UNKNOWN And just had a scroll wheel interface . 
UNKNOWN And the L_C_D_ display . 
UNKNOWN I suppose the L_C_D_ C_ display's the one that's pushing it up a bit though . 
UNKNOWN Yeah 'cause the Well 'cause we have to have both right ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I mean let's let's face it , it also depends on the software on the on the television . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN You can have the the information that this thing transmits be being displayed on the on the screen . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So s yeah let's take away the Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah you could maybe take out the L_C_D_ dis display even , if it if it comes up on the computer itsel on the T_V_ itself . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN So we may not need the L_C_D_ display ? 
UNKNOWN Uh that is possible yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN We may not need it . 
UNKNOWN There you go . 
UNKNOWN Well there we go . 
UNKNOWN Perfect . 
UNKNOWN There we go . 
UNKNOWN Twelve point five . 
UNKNOWN Perfect . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So we just remove our screen here . 
UNKNOWN Screen . 
UNKNOWN Make it a bigger dial . 
UNKNOWN Easier to use . 
UNKNOWN Even easier to use then . 
UNKNOWN Besides look at what the L_C_D_ does to our lovely remote . 
UNKNOWN Okay , the So we can just take away a heck of a lot of the there you go . 
UNKNOWN Back to the design room boys . 
UNKNOWN . 
UNKNOWN What's the blue part ? 
UNKNOWN central ? 
UNKNOWN That was just we ran out of yellow . 
UNKNOWN Oh that's the batteries . 
UNKNOWN Oh that's just yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN There you go . 
UNKNOWN There you go . 
UNKNOWN Oops . 
UNKNOWN Even simpler . 
UNKNOWN Looks more like a banana . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN For all those fruit lovers out there . 
UNKNOWN There you go . 
UNKNOWN One more criteria . 
UNKNOWN Okay so the costs under twelve point five Euro . 
UNKNOWN Was no . 
UNKNOWN We redesigned it . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Now it's yes . 
UNKNOWN Next slide. 
UNKNOWN Project evaluation . 
UNKNOWN Uh project process , satisfaction with , for example , room for creativity , leadership , teamwork , means , new ideas found . 
UNKNOWN Um So I guess that Let's see here . 
UNKNOWN I think that perhaps the project evaluation's just supposed to be completed by me . 
UNKNOWN But I'd like to hear your thoughts . 
UNKNOWN Trying to fill in some time there . 
UNKNOWN Fair enough . 
UNKNOWN Uh h what did you think of our project process ? 
UNKNOWN I think we did yeah I think we did quite well . 
CONFIRMATION Great . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Good . 
UNKNOWN Good teamwork . 
UNKNOWN Just half a day , you have a remote . 
UNKNOWN There you go . 
UNKNOWN Right from the start of the day . 
UNKNOWN Yeah I think we st we started off a little little weak . 
UNKNOWN We sort of knew where we were going straight away I thought . 
UNKNOWN Our leadership was quite weak in the beginning . 
UNKNOWN Um um But as the day went along we had more idea of what we were doing . 
UNKNOWN Um room for creativity ? 
UNKNOWN There was that . 
UNKNOWN Um I think we tried a lotta different things and um I think it was um interesting as you guys brought up more um information and studies that we were right on with a lot of those things . 
UNKNOWN Um you guys worked together well as a team . 
UNKNOWN And um the means ? 
UNKNOWN Which was the whiteboard and the pens . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN We've used the whiteboard . 
UNKNOWN Super super . 
UNKNOWN I had some problem with the pen I think , but minus your p Well Have a we have a list of employees that you would like fired . 
UNKNOWN Minus your PowerPointfiasco . 
UNKNOWN Well that's not my fault . 
UNKNOWN That's obviously the people I work for uh that work for me , uh they've just you know Heads are gonna roll , believe me . 
UNKNOWN No I know . 
UNKNOWN I'm yeah . 
UNKNOWN Incom Mm . 
UNKNOWN Yes yes . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN N new ideas found ? 
UNKNOWN Um Yes for the remote . 
UNKNOWN Kinda . 
UNKNOWN Maybe no not f for technology . 
UNKNOWN Technology used . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
UNKNOWN Closing . 
UNKNOWN Costs are within the budget . 
UNKNOWN Project is evaluated . 
UNKNOWN Um complete the final questionnaire and meeting summary . 
UNKNOWN That's it . 
CONFIRMATION Excellent . 
UNKNOWN And I still have to do my minutesfor the last meeting . 
UNKNOWN Actually . 
UNKNOWN Um so there will probably be another questionnaire coming up . 
UNKNOWN We might have a while though . 
UNKNOWN And then we'll have to check with the main boss whether we can , what goes on after that . 
UNKNOWN . 
UNKNOWN But that's the end of our meeting . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So as you guys know f , ISSCO is too small . 
UNKNOWN Well , the building is too small for our group . 
UNKNOWN So we're moving to a new building . 
UNKNOWN Uh it's gonna be the building across the street . 
UNKNOWN And we're actually moving in three weeks . 
UNKNOWN But the problem is that the administration wants to know who is going to be in what office in the new building and where we're g we're gonna put things like the printer , the fax machine , all the big equipment . 
UNKNOWN And the catch is that they have the final approval of where we put people and equipment . 
UNKNOWN And they want to know where we're gonna do all this by November second . 
UNKNOWN So that means basically next Tuesday . 
UNKNOWN And since we don't really have any other time we have to make these decisions today . 
UNKNOWN What we're getting is nine rooms for a maximum of eighteen people , which is okay , 'cause there's only fifteen of us . 
UNKNOWN And all the rooms have windows luckily , so there's no fights about who gets a window and who doesn't . 
UNKNOWN Um there's two views , either of the old town or the mountains and the rooms have various sizes . 
UNKNOWN There's two three people rooms , five two person rooms which are on the corners of the building , so you actually get windows on two walls , and two one person rooms . 
UNKNOWN That's pretty much what the building looks like . 
UNKNOWN Um and then you have the number of people per room . 
UNKNOWN The courtyard , because we're on the sixth floor , you can't actually go out to it , but it just means that the windows look out onto open space . 
UNKNOWN Um you can see the bathrooms , the elevators are sort of further down the hall . 
UNKNOWN The purple bar at the bottom , sort of on the right is the mail-boxes . 
UNKNOWN All of the windows open , you can get out onto the terrace just like we can in our normal building . 
UNKNOWN And the equipment that we have to put somewhere are like I said the photocopier , which is really big , the fax machine , which is not so big , and the printer , which is relatively big . 
UNKNOWN Each office has a white board , a bulletin board and a coat rack . 
UNKNOWN No cupboards like we have in the current offices , and each person gets their own chair , their own corner desk , so like the n the ones that we have now , um a small filing cabinet with three drawers , and by small I mean they're about that tall , and one sort of hanging shelf . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So we don't get the bookcases like we have now , but just one shelf that's attached to the wall . 
UNKNOWN And the people that we have to place , uh you can see the list there along with their position and the project that they work on . 
UNKNOWN And I guess the question the first question is how we want to organise people . 
UNKNOWN Whether we want to do it by rank , or by project , or I don't know , put all the P_H_D_ students together , all the professors together , that sort of thing . 
UNKNOWN So the idea is that we come up with a plan . 
UNKNOWN there's another group who's gonna be working on the same plan later this week . 
UNKNOWN And then Andre and I have to do presentationsfor the university administrators on the second . 
UNKNOWN So we have to come up with a plan , possibly , if we have time , a presentation, a quick presentationwith arguments for why we think our plan works best . 
UNKNOWN Okay ? 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So , anyone have any ideas or I guess Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh do we know if there will be a lot of people coming across the hall in terms of security stuff if we can I mean my idea is to put the photocopier and the fax in the hall . 
UNKNOWN Um I think it's the security is sort of the same as it is in the current building . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN So as long as the things are physically attached to the wall , so they can't be removed , then it should be okay to leave them in the hall . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN We can put it . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN It's just a question of whether you are printing sensitive documentsor n whatever . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Mm yeah . 
UNKNOWN So we only get one printer for fifteen people ? 
UNKNOWN Um well we get one sort of networked printer and then I think some of us have personal printers . 
UNKNOWN I think Susan has a personal printer , Gisella has one maybe . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , and that's it . 
UNKNOWN I can't remember who else . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But no-one else gets their own printer . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN In terms of equipment it's sort of the same thing as we have now . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN So what I'd propose is that we sort of discuss various concepts without getting into specifics , and then go off and think about it over lunch and then come back later in the day with sort of more specific proposals , as to exactly where to put people . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Mm yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Does that work ? 
UNKNOWN Oh , and on the mapthe little half-circular , well , quater circles are doors , which I'm assuming you've figured out , but just in case . 
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm okay . 
UNKNOWN 'Kay sure . 
UNKNOWN Yeah That's a good idea . 
UNKNOWN And there's just the one room that actually has two doors going into it , the the three person room on the right . 
UNKNOWN The three person room ? 
UNKNOWN rooms , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And do we need a room like a reading room or Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yes , yeah . 
UNKNOWN A lot of people were saying that they wanted to have a reading room . 
UNKNOWN So we should leave a space for that . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN And we can , because like I said maximum eighteen people in those rooms and there is only fifteen of us . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And I don't know if you've noticed , but two of us are only here half the time . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN So Martin and David um are half the time at the E_P_F_L_ and half the time in Geneva . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So sort of keep that in mind , I guess , when you are doing the actual planning . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN The first split we can do is between administration and reasearch uh . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I mean , it's completely different work so we can deal with administration and decide something for administration and then for the other . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But Gisella's really the only administrator . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Ad administrator . 
UNKNOWN But at least deal with that particular situation and then see with the other , because I was thinking uh Gisella is quite , I mean , Gile Gisella's work is quite noisy , because it's secretary so , yeah , lot of phone call and stuff like that so Yeah , so you won't share an office with Gisella unless you are fifty per cent and not the fifty per cent Gisella is working , which is another condition . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And she's always moving around . 
NEGATION No . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Which I don't know if we can assume that there isn't going to be any overlap between them . 
UNKNOWN Yeah mm . 
UNKNOWN So I don't know , maybe we can decide that Gisella is having one of the one person room . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I w I would suggest that too . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that would be maybe convenient . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Either that or maybe put her in a two person room with the equipment or Like with the the photocopier , or Maybe not the photocopier , but the printer . 
UNKNOWN With someone Yeah , and with someone who is who is fifty pro percent . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But at least the thing we know that Gisella is gonna be alone . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , okay , mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Or with equipment , but humanly alone . 
UNKNOWN And not with a hundred percent staff yeah a staff worker . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so th that's a one person room , but we don't know how how big they are . 
UNKNOWN Or it's hard to tell . 
UNKNOWN I mean , Gisella has this funny uh typing uh thing . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Typing machine . 
UNKNOWN I mean the rooms aren't tiny if you look at the this Yeah , yeah , that makes sense to put the fax in there . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Computer , fax . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So probably sh she should get the fax , right ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yes , yeah . 
CONFUSION Uh . 
UNKNOWN So . 
UNKNOWN And then I think the main discussion we should have is um if we want to make group of among the same project or among the same title or Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Or uh yeah , professor assistent or uh Or uh yeah Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Or Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Couple of professor and assistant or That's more a conceptual question than a practical question . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well , the third option is just completely mix everyone up , which some people say is better sort of for a group environment , so that you are not stuck only with the people who are working on your project . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's true . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN So if you share an office with someone who's on a completely different project , you find out about that project , but you also sort of interact with other people on a more regular basis . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Mm mm . 
UNKNOWN Mm yeah . 
UNKNOWN But still I find it's quite easy if you are with people who work in the same project in the same room , because you have the meetings or people come and ask you discuss things maybe . 
UNKNOWN I don't know if it's uh for other people who is not working on the same project . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but we will have this reading room , which can be Mm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's true . 
UNKNOWN That's that's true . 
UNKNOWN 'Kay uh will it be dedicated for reading and for studying or can we have meetings there . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Can reserve it for meetings . 
UNKNOWN I think it's not a question of reserving it , because there's other rooms at the university that you can reserve for a meeting , but if it's empty , then sure you can use it for a meeting . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , for a real meeting . 
UNKNOWN You can u mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN There's nothing wrong with that . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN But I think if someone's already reading in there , it's not fair to go and kick them out just because you want to have a meeting 'cause But if you're having a short meeting you don't really make an appointment for it . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Well , the the problem is if you have to go across the building and it adds some overhead every time you want to have some short meeting and discuss some issues . 
UNKNOWN Meeting about the project . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN Or maybe we shouldn't call it reading room , but So people would like to see uh the office organised by uh by by rank like professors and students and Yeah , that's a good idea , yeah . 
UNKNOWN You just kind of go to someone's office and go down for a coffee or whatever . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Mm yeah . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause there's still the cafeterias that you can use for informal Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Mm yeah . 
UNKNOWN The other thing we should take into account is if you receive student or not , because Marianne and I interact a lot with student and we have reception hours and stuff like that . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So it means you get time where a lot of people come along and talk and So it's maybe Yeah , so maybe it's not really nice to have to share an office with somebody like us , having a lot of social life and Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And the other Marianne too . 
UNKNOWN So there's three of you . 
UNKNOWN Well , but then you either share offices with each other , which doesn't really solve the problem , because chances are you are not gonna have office hours at the exact same time . 
UNKNOWN People coming and going . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , we don't . 
UNKNOWN So you're still going to have Like unless you get individual offices , I don't know if there's an easy way to find a solution for that . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I dunno . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause even if each of you share with a professor , then it's the same thing for the professor . 
UNKNOWN Yeah mm mm . 
UNKNOWN Yep , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But it is something to keep in mind . 
UNKNOWN Unless you end up sharing an office with someone where your schedules completely don't overlap , and then you can schedule office hours when the other person isn't there . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Some people come in around eleven and some people come in around eight . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but that's something we can't reasonably assume like that and make plans with that because Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN No , but you sort of see people's patterns . 
UNKNOWN I mean , even if it's not always like that , I mean if it's like that , you know , eighty per cent of the time , then But you're right , we can't make assumptions too much . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN I don't know . 
UNKNOWN I think Well , it's up to us how we do it . 
UNKNOWN I can see benefits of both . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , it certainly is . 
UNKNOWN But Yeah . 
UNKNOWN One point I can say by experience , it's really hard to share an office with three people , because it makes much more noise that only being two in an office . 
UNKNOWN Plus the computers . 
UNKNOWN Plus the computers . 
UNKNOWN Plus the com Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And we all know what it's like to have five computers in your office . 
UNKNOWN So we might be It might be a good idea to first exclude one of the three person room to be the reading room and not to be necessary a room with three people . 
UNKNOWN A working room . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but if there are people coming in , I mean , we have these people working for uh two months , who comes in the summertime or something . 
UNKNOWN I th think we should reserve a little bit space for them too . 
UNKNOWN So uh It's quite big Mm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's a good point , because if we take the three person room out as a reading room , then everyone has an office , right ? 
UNKNOWN 'Cause it's maximum eighteen . 
UNKNOWN So take away three spaces and you're down to your fifteen , and you're right , if we do have a stagieur , whoever , who comes in , then we have nowhere Well , we can put them in the reading room , but that kind of defeats the purpose . 
UNKNOWN Oh yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Oh yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah yeah . 
UNKNOWN So the other solution is to say , okay we use a three person room , but only with two person each time . 
UNKNOWN And leave a spare space for or But avoiding having three person full-time in a same room could be a good idea , I think . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN For soemthing , yeah , mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's yeah , certainly is . 
UNKNOWN Or again find people who don't work the same hours . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It doesn't completely solve the problem , but Yeah , I think so . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN So for the reading room we will have a two person room . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Maybe that would be good . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Everybody agrees on that , yep ? 
UNKNOWN A one person'll be too small anyways . 
UNKNOWN How about how about this room ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN The one on the bottom ? 
UNKNOWN Which one ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , at the bottom in the middle . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN With the mountain ? 
UNKNOWN With a view to the mountains , yeah . 
UNKNOWN It has three windows so I think it's uh Two ? 
UNKNOWN Two . 
UNKNOWN Well , which W There's three two person rooms . 
UNKNOWN O one two The the middle one . 
UNKNOWN That has two windows . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , it's Big black stripe is the windows , not the thin one between the big But what about the d the other one which has only one windows , but in the courtyard it maybe more quiet . 
UNKNOWN Which is fine . 
UNKNOWN Two . 
UNKNOWN And still a big room . 
UNKNOWN Oh , the big Oh . 
UNKNOWN Ah okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , so I should have explained that . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but then you get don't get a lot of light for reading . 
UNKNOWN We have electricity so I hope . 
UNKNOWN Really ? 
UNKNOWN No it's a question I mean it it's quite noisy outside with the streets and Yeah , we are on the sixth floor . 
UNKNOWN That's I dunno , I like the idea of looking out over lots of space . 
UNKNOWN On the sixth floor , I don't know . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Me too . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , if you are if you are reading . 
UNKNOWN And stop reading . 
UNKNOWN So it's a relaxing room . 
UNKNOWN Well , I mean that that's the whole point , right . 
UNKNOWN It's just somewhere to get out of your office and go and do something else for a while whether you're reading or just kind of staring off into space . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah , no okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Do so Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Mm yeah yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , and you can look outside of the window if you have a sh quick meeting there . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN You know , quick meetings always get longer . 
UNKNOWN So what about one of the room in the corner ? 
UNKNOWN So you have three windows . 
UNKNOWN It's even better . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , we could do that . 
UNKNOWN Why not ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But you have less wall to put shelves and stuff like that . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN If you intend the reading room being more a library or Mm . 
UNKNOWN We have some shelves , like cabinet type shelves for the reading room . 
UNKNOWN But it's not really intended to be a library . 
UNKNOWN I mean , we have an I_T_ library . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN A library down downstairs . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Um but the other idea is to take 'Cause right now we all have bookshelves . 
UNKNOWN So one idea might be to take sort of the books that aren't frequently used by people , put them all into that room . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So it becomes sort of a mini-library , but not like a library system library , just go and borrow your collegues' books . 
UNKNOWN Kind of , yeah , small library . 
UNKNOWN No no , no no . 
UNKNOWN No no , sure but Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN So are we all agree about these two person rooms ? 
UNKNOWN Which one ? 
UNKNOWN I don't know . 
UNKNOWN Corner or not corner ? 
UNKNOWN I think the middle one . 
UNKNOWN In the middle , yeah . 
UNKNOWN The middle one . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It's also sort of m central to the layout, so everyone sort of has more or less the same distance to It's not that it makes that much of a difference , but Why not ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFUSION Uh . 
UNKNOWN So we can exclude this one to make an office . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Actually what I can do is Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Or maybe write on the board , I don't know . 
UNKNOWN Um actually that's a good idea . 
UNKNOWN J just put it up . 
UNKNOWN So we have the mapand It's alright . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So . 
UNKNOWN This really isn't to scale , but Oh well . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN That's really not to scale . 
UNKNOWN Oh it's g good enough . 
UNKNOWN Um so we've got an office there . 
UNKNOWN And there's two and one Is that all ? 
UNKNOWN Three , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah mm . 
UNKNOWN So Okay . 
UNKNOWN Okay so this is that . 
UNKNOWN And this becomes the reading room , right ? 
UNKNOWN Is that a mountain ? 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN And that an old town ? 
UNKNOWN And uh Gisella ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , should we decide also the administration stuff ? 
UNKNOWN We thought a one person room . 
UNKNOWN And So we exclude the n the thing we are quite sure , and then we discuss the That's really noisy to be in the same office with the administration . 
CONFIRMATION Sure . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I was thinking of maybe we should assign Gisella into this three person office ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Because w we will probably place the printer next to the mailboxes . 
UNKNOWN Then we could have Gisella and the two fifty per cent people sharing the three person room . 
UNKNOWN Person room . 
UNKNOWN Well , th They're fifty per cent , yeah . 
UNKNOWN But if Gisella works fifty percent and they work fifty percent That's true . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that just imply you expect people to come when Gisella is not working , and that's not really fair if you So we can put Gisella in the two people room which is near the mailbox . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well , I mean it W yeah we could . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN I don't know . 
UNKNOWN We could . 
UNKNOWN I mean , I don't know how noisy she is . 
UNKNOWN I it's just the question , you always have the phone ringing , even if the af even when she's not working . 
UNKNOWN But Just Does Gisella have her own printer ? 
UNKNOWN It's uh Convenient for her , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Or f Yes , yes , she does . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but that's that's a good point from Nikos to say that she needs to be n near the mailbox and the printer and and the photocopier and stuff like that . 
UNKNOWN Well if you put her in in this room here , it's relatively close . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Exc except the door is not really convenient . 
UNKNOWN True . 
UNKNOWN No , but I think , if if the main , um how can I put that , the mm If the main reason to put to to choose Gisella's place , is the proximity of the mailbox , it should be a two pe people room and not a three people room . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It's fine with me . 
UNKNOWN Otherwise we have a one people room and Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I don't know how much the proximity to the mailbox matters , because usually when she's here and she picks up the mail, she actually brings it to your office . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , it's it's not the m Yeah , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It's more the I_T_ administration that uses our mailboxes . 
UNKNOWN No but it's it's also it's also the place of the photocopier . 
UNKNOWN And the place where we all pass kind of . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN That's true . 
UNKNOWN It should be some central place . 
UNKNOWN Because if we put the photocopier near the mailbox and it seems to be the only place where there is room for that Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah unless you put it into an office , which is just an annoying , I think . 
UNKNOWN Y Okay , we should write this down . 
UNKNOWN Yeah oh no . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause even if you put it into Gisella's office it's gonna be Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , no , it's too And it's too big and Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Do we agree that the that the photocopier and the networked printer goes next to the mailboxes ? 
UNKNOWN So . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's a good idea . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN And then we can for the moment put Gisella in this corner room if you agree , I don't know . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN What with I mean she is sharing an office right now and I Has anybody heard of any complaints that she's too loud or Okay . 
UNKNOWN At the beginning we said that we were gonna give her one of the one person rooms . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But this option of putting Gisella near the photocopier . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I mean , she is not sharing an office . 
UNKNOWN Well , she's Go ahead . 
UNKNOWN I mean sh we put some trainee in Gisella's office , because there is a spare room , and that's quite imp Yeah , that's quite uh I mean , that's quite important to keep a spare room in Gisella's office , if we need more staff , but I wouldn't work in Gisella's office . 
UNKNOWN Stagieurs in there . 
UNKNOWN And they are not really in a position to complain . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think it's just a question of work conditions , like if you are a stagieur and you co only coming in for two months , then you can put up with it , but if you're there , you know , for the full year Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah . 
UNKNOWN I it Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Mm yeah . 
UNKNOWN So for example now if uh we reserve Yeah , yeah . 
UNKNOWN For example , and there is no room in the cupboards for any people except Gisella , because she got lots of paperarchives and files and stuff like that . 
UNKNOWN Yeah that's true . 
UNKNOWN So it's really , she needs space . 
UNKNOWN She needs spaces . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But we can uh reserve So if you reserve a two people room , we can put uh trainees Further on if they are in the same room . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , in there if they need to go . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so Gisella at this southwest office ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN In the corner . 
UNKNOWN Are you sure it's southwest ? 
UNKNOWN I dunno if thi if this mapis a Okay , the mapis north oriented . 
UNKNOWN South Well , southwest if that's north . 
UNKNOWN South . 
UNKNOWN Southwest for us . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN No tha Well , I'm assuming that's what you meant , right ? 
NEGATION No . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah , that that one , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN That But that's southeast anyways . 
UNKNOWN I don't know . 
UNKNOWN Southeast , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Oh right , yeah , that's southeast , yeah it's Yeah , this office , yeah . 
UNKNOWN That's southeast . 
UNKNOWN Anyways yeah , but Okay . 
UNKNOWN This office right ? 
UNKNOWN That's . 
UNKNOWN You know because with mountain mountains and old town it's not No , sorry until but Okay . 
UNKNOWN No , I I'm very bad at orienting where's north in Geneva , I always get it wrong . 
UNKNOWN But I just assumed Nikos was talking about the orientation here . 
UNKNOWN Uh yeah , I was just talking about uh here on the map. 
UNKNOWN No , because sunrise and sunshine is quite uh sunshine , sunrise and sunset is quite also a good um something to take into account . 
UNKNOWN Oh , that's true . 
UNKNOWN So wait , we face the old town we face the old town now , and we are facing northeast . 
UNKNOWN Uh northeast . 
UNKNOWN North . 
UNKNOWN Sunrise . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So . 
UNKNOWN This is northeast . 
UNKNOWN It's east , yeah , east . 
UNKNOWN No , east . 
UNKNOWN We we have sun in the morning only . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN When do we have sun ? 
UNKNOWN So it does mean that the three piece room which is in the opposite of the northeast is the most sunny one . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN This one . 
UNKNOWN Let's say that . 
UNKNOWN The three people room or You get lots of sun during summer , yes . 
UNKNOWN But s Well , there is a quite a lot of sun . 
UNKNOWN It's it's the one you have of now , you both . 
UNKNOWN It's the oven . 
UNKNOWN More or less . 
UNKNOWN You get the sunset then . 
UNKNOWN No ? 
UNKNOWN And it's really warm and Do you Uh by the way , is it a six floor building or is there more Okay . 
UNKNOWN Y yes and no . 
UNKNOWN It's , yeah , it's really warm , that's Yeah yeah , that's true . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , we're the top floor . 
UNKNOWN So it's warm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It The building design is pretty much the same as the one we have now , we're just getting more space this way , because we couldn't move in the other building , 'cause it was occupied by the other departments . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Okay , good , p so And next . 
UNKNOWN So how many rooms and uh how many place do we have ? 
UNKNOWN So we have reserved now two two person rooms . 
UNKNOWN Actually , why don't I change it on here as well . 
UNKNOWN So that's Gisella . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , plus one spare place , but really the last place to be used . 
UNKNOWN Plus spare , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Plus fax . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN And then this is the reading room . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Oops . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN So that leaves us with what ? 
UNKNOWN We got two , three , four , six , nine Fourteen places ? 
UNKNOWN Six , eight , fourteen places , which is For f Yeah . 
UNKNOWN We got For fourteen people ? 
UNKNOWN For fourteen people ? 
UNKNOWN For fifteen people . 
UNKNOWN No for fourteen , 'cause Gisella's already got a room . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah . 
UNKNOWN So we are good . 
UNKNOWN T Okay . 
UNKNOWN Bless you . 
UNKNOWN Excuse me . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN So Can we group people by their name ? 
UNKNOWN So I'm gonna take Gisella off of that list as well . 
UNKNOWN I'll put her in grey , I guess . 
UNKNOWN Alphabetically . 
UNKNOWN I to Marianne . 
UNKNOWN Marianne , Marianne . 
UNKNOWN So it's gonna be Mariannes' office . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , why not ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that would be fun . 
UNKNOWN Is is any Is there anybody who's not happy with the current situation , so we could try to just keep the same arrangement just on the new building ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's going that can be . 
UNKNOWN That's boring . 
UNKNOWN That's boring , but that can be a good idea , but do do we can we do that ? 
UNKNOWN That's boring . 
UNKNOWN Can we ? 
UNKNOWN Because there is No we can't , because No we can't , there is two And two three person room . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN No , we don't . 
UNKNOWN We have , we have one extra one person office and Two three person offices , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Plus we have the two people who aren't there now that we have to put somewhere . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So Mm . 
UNKNOWN We can keep some of the people together that are together now , but not everyone definitely . 
UNKNOWN Yeah yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So , let's start then top to bottom : Maggie , Susan , . 
UNKNOWN Well , why don't we take a break and go off and think about it ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And then once we have more concrete ideas we can come back and finish it , 'cause if we just sit here and discuss , it's gonna take a long time and we're gonna start arguing and get cranky and Alright so Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think we clear the things a little bit up too s Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So let's have a break . 
UNKNOWN Save your file. 
UNKNOWN You have X_P_ ? 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN That's nice . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So how long is ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN And don't forget the I have a copy. 
UNKNOWN Oh yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um , so hi everyone . 
UNKNOWN Thanks for coming to this meeting . 
UNKNOWN Um well as you all know the topic of this morning's meeting is uh the fact that we're moving and we are going to get more space . 
UNKNOWN So that's a very good piece of news . 
UNKNOWN Uh but we also have to find out how we use this space . 
UNKNOWN So um if you want , I'll just give a brief overview of what's happening and then we can uh talk about , well , arranging these new uh the new office space . 
UNKNOWN So um in case you haven't seen the the documentsuh let me just uh show you very briefly the the configuration of the the space . 
UNKNOWN So um well , there is nothing much to say . 
UNKNOWN Well you know how many of us are are present and you know that we are um a bit tight actually in our present location . 
UNKNOWN Uh that's why actually the university finally um allocated us this uh this part of uh the Unimail building . 
UNKNOWN So it's at the sixth floor . 
UNKNOWN And it's uh sort of contiguous rooms as you you can all see from uh from here . 
UNKNOWN Um so the the the one P_ , two P_ , three P_ means the the number of persons . 
UNKNOWN As you can see we have several corridor um with a number of uh of uh of rooms , of one person rooms , two person room and and three person rooms . 
UNKNOWN Um actually I think Agnes did this nice drawingso she even put the the view , so we have the old town on one side , and the mountains on the other two sides . 
UNKNOWN Uh we have some bathrooms for us . 
UNKNOWN Uh and a courtyard which actually means a sort of uh shaft , because uh the court is uh down at uh the first floor . 
UNKNOWN Andre , just , yeah , just a a clarification question , are they number of people per room indicated strict , or can we play around with ? 
UNKNOWN I mean if there are two people , is it really that you can't put three or uh two and a half or uh how how was it calculated ? 
UNKNOWN Well , it's a bit difficult to say , because um in fact we have some constraints in terms of furniture . 
UNKNOWN Uh they are here . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN So um well , your your person Your your question actually is answered maybe by the third item . 
UNKNOWN So each person should get um , well , it's a sort of desk , it's made of two pieces and it looks like a corner . 
UNKNOWN With , of course , a chair . 
UNKNOWN Uh a filing cabinet that goes under the desk uh and , well , we can put hanging shelves over the the desks . 
UNKNOWN So I'm not really sure it's possible to get three um three desks in a two person office . 
UNKNOWN But um we could try . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN What's What should be said here , I don't know if , well , you I I will maybe distribute now documentsif you don't have them . 
UNKNOWN Maybe it's easier . 
UNKNOWN Do you need something , Martin ? 
UNKNOWN I have everything . 
UNKNOWN Um , I can keep this for you . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so Are you sure of that ? 
UNKNOWN Uh so it's it's Yeah , you have a copy, Susan . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN You too David , I think . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So in fact there are more places than people , so we won't be that constrained . 
UNKNOWN Uh as you know some of us and some of you here actually , Martin and David are part-time . 
UNKNOWN So it it's for the moment quite comfortable . 
UNKNOWN Normally we should even get an extra uh an extra place for , you know , temporary people coming to work on uh on projects . 
UNKNOWN Uh yeah , I uh yeah , I counted so we have um fifteen pers physical persons and about uh sixteen , I think , uh persons oh , actually , eighteen persons in the offices . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Two Six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen seventeen eighteen . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but counting the rea the the reading room . 
UNKNOWN Exactly , it so one of the issues uh here , it's probably not on the slides, is that we would like to have uh , unlike what had until now , a lounge or reading room uh in one of the the offices . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So in one of the rooms . 
UNKNOWN Do we really need that ? 
UNKNOWN Um , I think quite a lot of people e expressed the need for that . 
UNKNOWN So if we could do it , then I think it would be much nicer . 
UNKNOWN Um let me also uh st say something Yep . 
UNKNOWN And Susan , don't forget the time we spend to for discussions about that room , so you should be able to valorize this if possible . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I I think so . 
UNKNOWN But I still agree with you that the b the we are not so we are not so large , as far as space is concerned . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh because fifteen people to put in there eighteen positions , so uh to the best uh if you take uh two people room for the reading room , then you have uh sixteen places . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Well , sixteen slots for fifteen people . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN So it's still should be feasible . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that that also means that the growth will be zero . 
UNKNOWN That's Yeah , I think that's quite important to manage some space . 
UNKNOWN Maybe we can think of , yeah , some two or three , yeah , for visiting people . 
UNKNOWN Visiting visiti visiting researchers , students coming for exchange students et cetera . 
UNKNOWN Correct . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so let me finish with the the constraints which are almost done . 
UNKNOWN So we also need to to find the a spot for the photocopier , the fax machine , and the printer . 
UNKNOWN The fax , you know , is very small , but um the photocopier is quite huge , and the printer is uh well ab this size . 
UNKNOWN Um okay , the offices comes with white boards . 
UNKNOWN Not very uh very important . 
UNKNOWN Uh the furniture that w each each person has and uh you have a list of people . 
UNKNOWN So the thing uh you you ought to know is that we're not the only ones that w we're thin that that are thinking about uh for well , about putting people i in these rooms . 
UNKNOWN Um there is another group that is also having discussions . 
UNKNOWN So the idea is that today we'll just try to f start seeing the main constraints and then you have time to to go and think about it uh ask the people you know , your assistants , for instance , and at the next meeting we'll try to to come with one solution . 
UNKNOWN Uh , the other group will also propose a solution and then there will be another negotiation . 
UNKNOWN So w Uh if i if we don't get these ? 
UNKNOWN And if we don't get this space then what happens ? 
UNKNOWN These , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um , well basically they are promised to us so uh Do do you think there are chances that they take from us one of the rooms or uh Yeah , I I I think it's uh Uh , yeah . 
UNKNOWN We j we stay where we are . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN No the the the chances might be that there are more people to put in that space . 
UNKNOWN Yeah i yeah , that's one of the the problems . 
UNKNOWN I think maybe we should take this into account and maybe think of some of the bigger rooms with four people , one being temporary or or part-time . 
UNKNOWN Um okay , so maybe we could try to to see now what would be the main options . 
UNKNOWN Say the general uh , well , arrangement options . 
UNKNOWN Do you think that we should put people , say , according to projects for instance ? 
UNKNOWN In in the table that um that we have , uh we also have the uh uh the p the main projects on which the people are working . 
UNKNOWN So how Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Andre , sorry for interrupting , but uh one again clarification question , what is the real margin of manoeuvre that we have for these discussions , because uh at least we are half per cent uh fifty per cent of from E_P_F_L_ and uh sometimes you have meetings where w y the the decision is already taken , so uh um you can spend quite a lot of time discussing things , so what what will be the impact of what we will come out come up with ? 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Oh , actually what is fixed is the n the number of rooms . 
UNKNOWN This we cannot really change . 
UNKNOWN I mean at least not us , it would be much more difficult to get another another room for instance . 
UNKNOWN But what is absolutely n not fixed is the arrangement of the people in the rooms . 
UNKNOWN So basically we are all the permutations are possible at the moment . 
UNKNOWN So , another way of a Another way of asking the question , is there any other group already working on uh on the how this should be uh should be allocated ? 
UNKNOWN Or are we the the one that is supposed to do the p the the p position for it ? 
UNKNOWN Um Well , what we are looking for is a solution that suits everyone and that makes the maximum of people happy . 
UNKNOWN So uh the other group is , uh I don't think we have to see them as competitors , but they are just trying to to find another local optimum . 
UNKNOWN Or l uh Uh Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But wha why why don't they have any representative here . 
UNKNOWN I mean Yeah , why do we do it separately ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , why didn't we have a meeting together ? 
UNKNOWN Uh , they have another group and then uh uh uh Andre and Agnes will discuss about it with . 
UNKNOWN You are the rep representative of this group actually . 
UNKNOWN Yeah uh uh we Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I I think that's Yeah , there is no real competition between the two , but we'll just try to find at least two solutions and see how how close they are , actually . 
UNKNOWN It's it's I think well the m the people who who decided this thought it was the best solution to , mm well , you know , find two two kinds of opinions . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Well , we could have been eight h sitting around here and and talking , but I think it's it's more difficult . 
UNKNOWN No , but you know that that's a standard thing . 
UNKNOWN It's Suppose that somebody for some strange reasons want to be in the corner and we don't know about that , we'll put them put her or him somewhere else , then we will do plenty of work for nothing , because we'll not have this constraint . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN We'll not be aware of this constraint . 
UNKNOWN Well Exactly , I think So so today the goal is not to to find the solution today , but to set some constraints and then go and see the people and find out if they have any preferences . 
CONFIRMATION Oh , okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Obviously we won't be able to accommodate all the the preferences , but at least we'll find the most uh the most important ones . 
UNKNOWN Well , certainly we have to ask uh Pierrette and uh and Maggie , since they're not here , because they also have a lot of students that they have to see as we do , and so that's another consideration , too . 
UNKNOWN P s I think Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I think so that's one of the things I think we know that they have students , we don't know exactly if they prefer for instance to be alone , or to well , to be with their assistant , or even with another person working on the project . 
UNKNOWN So that would have been maybe , yeah , another solution is to ask everyone to provide uh an arrangement , but uh I think that's a bit uh a bit hard then to to work out . 
UNKNOWN Um so since all of you have a copyof the uh , well , of the drawing, I think for the next time , m maybe you could come with a concrete proposal with uh names on it . 
UNKNOWN But let us try to see today whether we prefer to organise people , say , by projects or just professor and assistant . 
UNKNOWN So what would be f , say , first your preferences , since Let's let's start with us , maybe today . 
UNKNOWN Um what do you think about it ? 
UNKNOWN Would you prefer to be alone , would you prefer to be with your assistant . 
UNKNOWN You who are part-time , do you think you can come here on a very w well regular schedule or is it part-time , but variable during the week ? 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah uh , okay uh , me personally I would like to to to share the other peopl n uh the room with assistants as when you have problems of normal life , like uh the printer doesn't work , uh I don't want to ask this to my supervisor , so it's better to to be with a with an assistant to share the room . 
UNKNOWN Uh-huh . 
UNKNOWN And since you're coming on the uh half-time , do you think you will be able to group your presence here , say Monday , Tuesday and Wednesday morning , or is it going to be m much more random ? 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN What uh I don't think it's a good idea to share uh t to ha to share the same desk . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Uh I still would like to have my drawers and these things . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I think so too . 
UNKNOWN Um so Martin , you are also uh half-time and , well , the third person is Gisella . 
UNKNOWN I think it's quite clear that mm each person should have their own desk and Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I agree with that . 
UNKNOWN That's Whe whe where part-time is important is that it's n an overlo load on a room , so um for sure if you have a part-time person , it reduces the the ranges of time where too many people in the room . 
UNKNOWN It's no no way we we could put two persons at the same desk . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I think grouping Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN As far as I am concerned I probably might be able to have a kind of a regular presence here . 
UNKNOWN Um , the uh the thing that f in my case has to be taken into account is that I will have a lot of phone calls . 
UNKNOWN So I'll be talking o o o over the phone all the time . 
UNKNOWN Oh great . 
UNKNOWN So that's not necessary Well , it depends on I I have nothing against sharing a a an office with somebody . 
UNKNOWN I d already did it before , so and it was perfectly fine . 
UNKNOWN It just has to be somebody who can work while somebody else is having phone calls in the in the room , which is very d much dependent on people . 
UNKNOWN Some people are not disturb at all by this . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Some people just can't work . 
UNKNOWN Are you disturbed by the phone calls of other people ? 
UNKNOWN I'm not . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN But uh and uh what might happen , but it uh it will not be so heavy here uh at ISSCO is visitors . 
UNKNOWN So that I will have more at E_P_F_L_ , uh typically students coming in um or asking for things . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN As I'm not teaching here , I'm teaching at E_P_F_L_ , this should shouldn't be a such a big load . 
UNKNOWN So for me it it will be essentially I will not be I will not be able to be silent in the room , because I will be communicating also through vocal means , so Hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Ye mm before um talking more about individual preferences , is there any possibility , what they have done in the uh faculty of law , for example , that they actually split rooms ? 
UNKNOWN And so we would take uh uh one of the two people rooms and split it . 
UNKNOWN And you would see that you would have the same size office , but that would give the privacy . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um insofar as in just about every other faculty in the building , every professor has their own office . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN And it's it's really it goes a bit far that uh we have to have this uh all this sharing uh . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN So one option and that but that we would need to ask about if we could uh split one of the rooms uh That doesn't really solve it uh I mean there's there's really a difference to having to have your own Yeah , and sometimes you have uh you need to have private uh discussions with somebody or whatever , so Well , I I think it's uh really a matter of personal preference . 
UNKNOWN Do you go for boxes for instance ? 
UNKNOWN In the in the bigger rooms where , yeah You know like uh cubicles ? 
UNKNOWN Like cubicles . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN You mean , you really want to have walls . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Four walls . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , sure sure . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I I I will try to find out whether we can separate . 
UNKNOWN I think for the moment the answer at least is no , because um it's not only , well , making a wall , but also b mm making a new door . 
UNKNOWN So it's quite a lot of uh of work , but uh I will try to find this out for the next time . 
UNKNOWN Um , so at least for the moment , as you can see there are uh I can show them here on the screen . 
UNKNOWN So there are these two rooms on the left that uh accommodate one person . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So at least some of the professors , since you are four , uh could could go uh well , could take these uh these rooms . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And quite a lot of rooms with two persons . 
UNKNOWN Uh how do you feel Susan about the professor sharing the room with her assistants or the one which is the most involved in in the teaching ? 
UNKNOWN As you know um , I prefer to have uh my own office . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um , I also have uh a lot of phone calls and y you know , have to see people , and with the other work that I'm doing with the rectorate uh , that is really confidential information that I'm treating . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So I That I have to be really careful about too . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But it's a personal preference uh . 
UNKNOWN Insofar as what we've had up until now , both Maggie and Pierrette have been happy to share with others . 
UNKNOWN So I mean I think that we should still check with them Well , not sharing with each other . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN I fully agree with that . 
UNKNOWN That's uh it's much easier to me to uh to foresee having two people of the same position sharing a room , than uh Oh sharing with their students . 
UNKNOWN They each share with an assistant . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Oh sorry , because but that that's uh it's it's tricky because of confidentiality reasons , as you said . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , you you you are discussing a budget on the on the project , you over the phone typically you don't necessary want to have somebody who will be dependent on that budget being part of the discussion , so No . 
UNKNOWN Paid on that Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's um that's true . 
UNKNOWN Um , okay . 
UNKNOWN Um , maybe we could s look a bit at the projects . 
UNKNOWN Do you think it's a good idea to put together in the same room as much as possible people from the same project , since they talk quite a lot of to each other ? 
UNKNOWN No , because pro project doesn't last in time . 
UNKNOWN They will change . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN That's what The only thing that will not or that will change only progressively in time is the status of the people . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Well , yeah , and some of the P_H_D_ students will hopefully finish their P_H_D_ at some point . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , they will promote that . 
UNKNOWN But still , th some things Well , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , and also some of our the people mentioned here are working on more than one project too . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So For example , uh Marianne de uh , she's also working with me on the virtual campus project , so she that one wasn't mentioned , but I'm not saying that I necessarily want to be with her in the office , but uh it's just to say people are working on uh sometimes more than one project uh Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Uh-huh . 
CONFIRMATION Okay , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN If if it if i if projects are what you have in mind , I think that uh meeting room is the the tool for that . 
UNKNOWN If you need to have people in a projects talking together , they just have a meeting room if it's not too far away then then it's a very good good practice . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well , actually , so the lounge could serve as some kind of meeting room , but there are also more formal meeting rooms available in in the building , as we now know . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN That's why I was quite receptive to uh Susan's remark at the beginning is I wouldn't formulate it in a such a an extreme way as , do we really need the lounge ? 
UNKNOWN But uh I would p probably formulate it in the way that uh , do we want to have only a lounge or s something that can be used only as a reading room ? 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Because because meeting rooms to me are very important tools to do uh collaborative work . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN But on the other hand we also have to relax , so that's Yes . 
UNKNOWN So I think we need a Yeah , and and I think also we need a separate discussion on the furnishing of the lounge , which is a whole other topic . 
UNKNOWN Well , yeah , we'll skip that for now . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN No I d um the lounge okay , but I think we need to also see it as a overflow place when we have um uh visitors for any length of time , so they actually have a place to work . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause that's really my one of my worries with the plan that we have here is that it's it pr provides no possible possibilities of expansion . 
UNKNOWN Uh-huh . 
UNKNOWN And this will happen . 
UNKNOWN Um Yeah , yeah , for the moment actually I think only one slot would be fully free . 
UNKNOWN I mean you can't you can't prevent having visitors . 
UNKNOWN And you shouldn't . 
UNKNOWN No , you want to have visitors . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh that is Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Which for for fifteen people it's not enough . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that means one visitor at a time . 
UNKNOWN I mean uh Yeah it's We have we have four professors here and and and two researchers . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Or one intern . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN It's It's funny that uh we move to another building because we run out of uh space and we will have the same problem . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Yes , but we have more space here than what we currently have , so it's at least some Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Ah okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , it's already in progress . 
UNKNOWN It's bad it's bad . 
UNKNOWN And you're you're working Uh I think , yeah , w Okay , so one of the things I have to do for the next time is fin find out about the separations between rooms and Yeah , I think it's quite a heavy transformation of the building . 
UNKNOWN Because this is really related with security uh regulation as well . 
UNKNOWN I mean you can't just put walls in in rooms without any specific authoris Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh it's not necessary heavy in terms of work . 
UNKNOWN It's heavy in terms of administrative authorisation . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN And okay , I'll try to find out . 
UNKNOWN At least at E_P_F_L_ . 
UNKNOWN And the other question is , can we squeeze maybe four people in the uh or at least four places in the three three P_ room ? 
UNKNOWN I think so . 
UNKNOWN If you organise the desks in a in a intelligent way . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , hopefully visitors don't need as much say filing space , or um Yeah , they don't have that many papers . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , right , that's the point . 
UNKNOWN Uh okay . 
UNKNOWN So that's uh I have to to ask , so you don't really feel um very strongly attached to this uh grouping by projects idea ? 
NEGATION No . 
NEGATION No . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN No , because they can share their ideas across the project , yeah , I would say . 
UNKNOWN Um Yeah , exactly . 
UNKNOWN Coffee machines are that made for that . 
UNKNOWN But uh usually , whe when new assistants come , they would like to share the room with someone that knows uh l uh it's related with the project , so he can Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN No , that's that's proximity doesn't play a big role there . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN We can discuss with people that the the space is very small , I mean , altogether it's And uh you don't y you don't need to discuss about the projects , you f more need about th to discuss about where is the printer , how do I get furniture , I'm I don't have a a pencil , where is the the box with the pencils , and so on . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , they they can change . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN No , okay . 
UNKNOWN This is not project related . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN No , and if you look now at their uh the the current division of the offices , for example , uh Bruno and Agnes are sharing an office and they're working on totally different projects and and they're they're just fine with that . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I think that's that's going to be one of the the main things we'll have to ask is whether people have strong preferences either in staying with someone or in uh not staying . 
UNKNOWN Um , are you aware f of any strong constraints right now ? 
UNKNOWN Well , there there were , but they sort of disappeared as of October when the no smoking rule came in , because before we were grouping the smokers and now that there's no smoking , uh I guess that's not very important option , though Well , except for that maybe you don't even want anybody smoking on your balcony , so No . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's true . 
UNKNOWN Okay , yeah , that's true . 
UNKNOWN So smoking is now um no longer a constraint . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Is it allowed to smoke inside an office , if it's a one person No , not any more . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN No , n it's in in principle it's a it's a no smoking building . 
UNKNOWN It's non-smoking campus . 
UNKNOWN You can smoke outside . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So you can go outside onto the balcony to smoke . 
UNKNOWN Not even in the cafeteria ? 
UNKNOWN Not even in the cafeteria . 
UNKNOWN Downstairs ? 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN Full no smoking building for all of the six thousand students . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN That's the new regulation . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Wow . 
UNKNOWN On the roof maybe . 
UNKNOWN Uh on the balcony , actually . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN The balcony , okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Normally . 
UNKNOWN There is the there's that terrace . 
UNKNOWN But Andre , uh just a Still some places where smokers can survive . 
UNKNOWN Wow , there there's no place in inside the building ? 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN Wow , E_T_P_F_L_ is a c it's a non-smoking campus , but there are some places tha Yeah yeah yeah . 
UNKNOWN But Andre , just a comment abou about your your previous uh request . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN I I don't think that anyone will provide you information such as who doesn't want to be with whom . 
UNKNOWN That's a typical uh output of ex uh research in expert systems . 
UNKNOWN These are the rules that you never get . 
UNKNOWN But uh you can get them through a proposal . 
UNKNOWN The other way . 
UNKNOWN So you propose a set-up , where people are with other peoples and they will find politically correct ways to tell you that uh they don't want to have a view on the mountains , but they prefer to have view on the old town , so they would be in the toilets . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN O on the toilets or Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN They would um p prefer to be in another room . 
UNKNOWN No , we we do have one constraint that's difficult , which is uh Gisella , because when she's there she's very noisy . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN She's on the phone a lot It's just it's by Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But that's a sec s that's the admin that's the admin uh so it's part of the work . 
UNKNOWN It's by nat uh by the nature of her work that uh a lot of it is communication . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Yes , Martin said also for him and , yeah , especially for her . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN Yeah the in she's the interface . 
UNKNOWN And that that's a problem , you're right , because because we don't have a one person we d we don't have enough one person rooms for uh accommodating the uh the admin place . 
UNKNOWN So Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN And uh if you put two person persons or three persons for the admin space , who who who else would you put in there ? 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Because we don't have any assistant manager or we don't have We have only one half part half-time uh admin and no other non-researcher positions , if I'm not mistaken . 
UNKNOWN And this is really a piece of a problem . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN Maybe you could put some visitors , but um I know . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I think Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It's not very uh realistic in a in a in an admin room , but uh Yeah , because You can't put a researcher there . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN I think putting Gisella with the other admin of the school is not an option , because we weren't offered Yeah , it would be nice , but uh Okay , I'll try to find out , but uh I th Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think that's a excellent idea . 
UNKNOWN Why don't we ask about that ? 
UNKNOWN That's just Either you lose one position or you find another admin or assistant manager . 
UNKNOWN I mean there is certainly enough space uh down the hall , wi if all of those uh uh offices that are , where half of them are also half time , and they're very under-used . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So um And Pierrette too . 
UNKNOWN Okay , we'll try , but all these , yeah , are say sort of difficult questions because they involve changing also the offices of the school and , you know , people just don't wanna change in general . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN Um , let's see , maybe we can find some temporary well , at least a proposal for Gisella . 
UNKNOWN So , since the one-person rooms are quite , well , sort of um desired by a lot of people , she should probably No , y Yeah . 
UNKNOWN No that's not sure that's not sure . 
UNKNOWN Uh the there are To me there are two options possible is either you we can take one of the one person rooms for the admin , because some of , typically , the professors have good reasons for sharing . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Sharing either with a colleague or sharing uh with some of their uh one of their P_H_D_ students . 
UNKNOWN In that case it's it's realistic . 
UNKNOWN Then we could very very simply uh allocate the one pers one of the one person rooms for the admin . 
UNKNOWN And that would solve the problem . 
UNKNOWN The other thing is to take a two person room for the admin . 
UNKNOWN That could be the one uh close to the uh close to the here in the centre so uh the Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Uh , the the middle one here ? 
UNKNOWN But tha No no no , the other one , the the one op Yeah , here , this one . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN This one . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN But then uh that the the question of what do we do with the second position there remains fully open . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So I would be I would be more of the opinion to to see whether it's it's so evident that , let's say the at least the two full full-time professors that are here on the list , we have one here , but uh Maggie is is not present . 
UNKNOWN Well Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN If they really Yeah , and Pierrette . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN If if if because of personal preferences they would be happy with a two person room , which might or might not be the case . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , well Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN I mean it's it's certainly not uh something that we should impose , but we can ask . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , because in this case , yeah , Gisella could take one of the the two person rooms and the other place would be for some kind of visitor , that I or Ah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but that's not realistic either . 
UNKNOWN I mean , you have you have a fore foreign researcher coming visiting you and you will put put him in the admin office ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFUSION Uh . 
UNKNOWN Uh you'll not do that . 
UNKNOWN I mean uh , maybe you can do that with an exchange student , that's But you can't take a senior visitor and uh him in the in the secretary . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , with with younger people , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , or an intern . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN So we we invite invite and then we say , okay you can sit with Gisella . 
UNKNOWN Uh you're here . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Okay so this sets a bit the stage for uh for Gisella then . 
UNKNOWN Uh yeah we'll try to to find out . 
UNKNOWN Um , actually , yeah , maybe we should remind that quite a lot of professors at the at the school actually share their office with their assistant . 
UNKNOWN So b it looks like sort of an implicit tradition . 
UNKNOWN Um Except for in every other faculty . 
UNKNOWN Maybe not to be followed . 
UNKNOWN As Susan said , p Yeah ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Is that so ? 
UNKNOWN Yes , it is so . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN Every other faculty as far as I have seen their offices and the people that I know and that's in um in law , uh socio-economics , uh okay ? 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN It's a They all have their own office . 
UNKNOWN I mean in in the in the law faculty they're at best there half time . 
UNKNOWN No no , that's it . 
UNKNOWN As we said , it's it's really a matter of personal preference , it cannot be something else . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN It cannot be imposed for sure . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It's uh job . 
UNKNOWN Um , okay so I think Well , this sets a bit uh the stage . 
UNKNOWN Uh could we try So could you try please to uh Do you want an extra uh piece of paper? 
UNKNOWN Maybe try to , well , think on your own and then talk a little bit just to the people around you . 
UNKNOWN Again uh uh um , Andre , I think that the only realistic way we can do is to speak for our for ourselves . 
UNKNOWN I can tell you according to what I know now where I would like or would be ready to be , but I really don't see how I could decide for uh Maggie or Pierrette or whoever else on the list , that they should be there . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN No the point was to try to , well , just talk to them , to David , or Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN We're gonna have to . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , b why why couldn't we do like couldn't we do it like for for the the set-up of meetings . 
UNKNOWN You you everyone received that and uh should provide Yeah , I would like to be here . 
UNKNOWN And then you will have this multi-constraint problem and uh you work during two hours and you come up with the optimal solution . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So w w w will you ask people just for their place or also for the other people's place ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I would I would ask for their place . 
UNKNOWN I mean that's that's that's the important thing you want to know . 
UNKNOWN Because Uh-huh . 
UNKNOWN W what abou what about the the the cafeteria ? 
UNKNOWN Well , but that's Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN I mean , we are going to purchase a cafeteria with a projector and all this altogether or Reading room , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh it's a reading room . 
UNKNOWN It's altogether . 
UNKNOWN Reading room , it's not a cafeteria . 
UNKNOWN So in the living room Bu I ju just before finishing uh , I mean , we have a cafeteria or we don't eat at all ? 
UNKNOWN But that that's an open question whether it's a it's a it's a it At the origin it was supposed to be a f pure reading room for relaxing , uh reading the newspapers , et cetera , et cetera . 
UNKNOWN Uh there has been a very long discussion about that . 
UNKNOWN I stinct uh this discussion is still vivid , that some of the people , I bel belong to these people , would like to have a mixed room where you can have a reading room for sure , but also meeting room if necessary . 
UNKNOWN Or , as uh Susan said , a room an emergency room where you can put uh some visitors in a decent environment for for for for work , because you don't have any other place to do it . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN But that's that's really an open discussion and that d I think no decision , no final decision has been taken about that . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay , th then Okay then for the next time , um try to come up either with your own preferences , that's quite easy probably to state now that you know the constraints , or if you can poll a little bit the people around you , that would be I mean , even Well , just discuss i Yeah , for instance , I mean No , no , I was thinking just ask people around you what they think about this . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN The one that I don't want to have in the next room ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN And I think , yeah , it will be nice to to come with maybe a sketchof of these . 
UNKNOWN If you can do slides, it's even better , but uh don't be that formal . 
UNKNOWN And uh we'll try to at least build up one coherent proposal , and we'll merge it with the other one when the other one uh is available . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Okay , I'll ask um uh Maggie and Pierrette uh if they have uh any preferences . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN That would be great . 
UNKNOWN Oh , great . 
UNKNOWN That would be great . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Perfect . 
UNKNOWN C that that of course is one of the main well not main but one of the important features that we need to know about . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , since they're not at the meeting I think it's in out of courtesy we should first ask them . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN And I'll try to Fine . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN We don't have cafeteria . 
UNKNOWN What do you mean by cafeteria exactly ? 
UNKNOWN He means reading room . 
UNKNOWN A place n what mm uh we can take a coffee also . 
UNKNOWN What Yeah , w we can bring your coffee in the reading room , but So so since maybe , you're a part-time here , and part-ti part-time at E_P_F_L_ , there are at least two um coffee machines in the building , one at the third floor , one at the first floor . 
UNKNOWN No , there is no coffee in the reading room . 
UNKNOWN No ? 
UNKNOWN That was the wrong We we did not have any money for buying the coffee machines , so Five . 
UNKNOWN But they close at five or ? 
UNKNOWN And we can bring our coffee . 
UNKNOWN No uh automatic uh coffee machines . 
UNKNOWN Ah okay . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN Coffee machines . 
UNKNOWN Okay , okay . 
UNKNOWN So uh yeah . 
UNKNOWN No , there's the cafeteria is downstairs , but they close at five . 
UNKNOWN But , in Uh-huh . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah , this . 
UNKNOWN Ah that's the main problem . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but there's the two machines , and they're uh the vending machines where you just put the money and and you can get Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , vending machines . 
UNKNOWN And you can bring your coffee in the reading room . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , maybe this is not a very bad timing . 
UNKNOWN Could we try to meet uh next Tuesday ? 
UNKNOWN T to try the coffee ? 
CONFUSION Wait .
UNKNOWN Um , next Tuesday maybe at t maybe a bit later ? 
UNKNOWN Maybe at eleven o'clock ? 
UNKNOWN Wait , wai wai wai wait . 
UNKNOWN Wait , wait . 
UNKNOWN Next Tuesday . 
UNKNOWN Tuesday um Ch Um we have the don't forget we have the other meeting the M_D_M_ meeting in the morning , so it would have to be in the afternoon . 
UNKNOWN Come on , try try to be nice . 
UNKNOWN Uh , well well well well , not so easy , eh ? 
UNKNOWN Gi give me a reasonable date . 
UNKNOWN Yes , I ha I have no constraints , so it's fine . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , for me it's a good timing . 
UNKNOWN Uh-huh , okay . 
UNKNOWN Next Tuesday we have a meeting , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Exactly . 
UNKNOWN That might be Where is the meeting ? 
UNKNOWN It's Unimail ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so , yeah yeah , then it could be that That yeah . 
UNKNOWN At nine thirty , but we could do we could have this meeting then in the afternoon . 
UNKNOWN That that would be great , because that would allow us not to move , or not to travel twice . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Nah ? 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Very well . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN So about two o'clock ? 
UNKNOWN Would that be okay ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN After lunch . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , after lunch . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It's not a very demanding meeting , so um Perfect . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um , then let me close this . 
UNKNOWN And uh good luck for your arrangement games . 
THANKS Thank you . 
UNKNOWN Hey look , these are microphones they uh they're for women's shirts . 
UNKNOWN No no it's the opposite . 
UNKNOWN Um okay , so um let's start . 
UNKNOWN Um thanks for coming again to this meeting . 
UNKNOWN I hope it won't be too long and especially that we'll make some progress on uh this uh on this small task that is putting people in our new rooms . 
UNKNOWN Uh I hope you had fun in uh , well , designing something or uh asking the people about their preferences and uh things like this . 
UNKNOWN So yeah , that's what I was talking about , it's for women's shirts . 
UNKNOWN Um so um well , I think you remember all the constraints and the new settings , I think , you'll be more and more used to it as as soon as we move . 
UNKNOWN So we have these one person , two person and three person rooms . 
UNKNOWN Um and so that makes , I think , eighteen places . 
UNKNOWN And we had about fifteen people and some uh spare uh spare mm well , working places to to put um may I first uh provide the answers to the the questions from the last time ? 
UNKNOWN And I also checked with uh Maggie and Pierrette . 
UNKNOWN Oh , great , yeah . 
UNKNOWN So that will be part of the your uh your solution or suggestions to solution . 
UNKNOWN But regarding the constraints um there is no immediate plan to to make separations between the rooms so that means basically well , we have to do with this setting and uh it's it's quite difficult to make new doors and new walls , so I think we shouldn't count on them in the next uh four years maybe . 
UNKNOWN And they don't want us to sh I mean they don't want to provide an extra working space for Gisella with the other I_T_ admins , which we could understand , because it's sort of full over there , but uh at least that's what they said . 
CONFIRMATION Great . 
UNKNOWN Come now , it's not full over there . 
UNKNOWN So it seems we uh yeah the well , we cannot change the habits of the whole school just for us . 
UNKNOWN Though it wouldn't be a bad thing maybe , but uh we'll see . 
UNKNOWN So regarding the possibility to put four people in one of the two uh three person rooms , um well , it's not very easy , we'll have to play uh quite uh quite wisely with the furnishing . 
UNKNOWN It it looks like it's not impossible , at least on the one that is a bit uh longer , on on the right . 
UNKNOWN So uh the one uh here . 
UNKNOWN It should be possible to put four persons . 
UNKNOWN If we could avoid it , it would much simplify things , but uh , well , we'll see . 
UNKNOWN The the question is is it is it against the regulation security regulation of the school . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN No uh no . 
UNKNOWN That's that's the important point . 
UNKNOWN No no no . 
UNKNOWN And and I and I went over and I looked at that room , too . 
UNKNOWN There's plenty of space for four people . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I think , yeah . 
UNKNOWN It it's more a matter of how to arrange the furniture , but uh since we are experts at this task uh okay , so maybe we could count on on four places , but the final decision is not really ours , so uh we'll see actually this Exactly . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN That would be fine if one of the person is fifty per cent . 
UNKNOWN So me , for example . 
UNKNOWN Or one of the intern positions , the people who might come or something like that . 
UNKNOWN Ah . 
UNKNOWN Exactly . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um okay so these were the um the answers . 
UNKNOWN So actually I I did my uh my proposal as a slide. 
UNKNOWN Would you like me to start or would you like me to end ? 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Well just t just to uh uh complete uh , I talked both with Maggie and Pierrette and both of them are happy to share offices . 
UNKNOWN Please . 
UNKNOWN It's uh Oh , great . 
UNKNOWN They have no problem whatsoever . 
UNKNOWN Uh they're they're easy , but uh could be uh as Pierrette has right now , that she cou she is happy to continue to share with uh Marianne , uh and and Maggie , for example , to share with uh it could be with Bruno , because they work on the SwissTra together and they like to gossip together , so . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Okay , okay . 
UNKNOWN Beautiful . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN That looks good . 
UNKNOWN Okay , then let me um explain very briefly the the rationale for for this . 
UNKNOWN So it's the same uh schemathat you know . 
UNKNOWN In red you have the uh uh oh , excuse me , that's quite uh annoying , excuse me . 
UNKNOWN Um hello . 
UNKNOWN Oh , yeah , um , can I can I call you a bit later in about half an hour . 
UNKNOWN People sh yeah that's . 
UNKNOWN People who don't turn off their phone in a meeting . 
UNKNOWN I'm just in the middle of a meeting and I'm talking . 
UNKNOWN It's fantastic . 
UNKNOWN Oh okay , thank you . 
UNKNOWN Bye-bye . 
UNKNOWN Let me check that I I di I didn't . 
UNKNOWN Um , sorry for this . 
UNKNOWN S Yeah , but putting the printer in the lounge is just killing the lounge . 
UNKNOWN Fortunately we were just uh the four of us . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so , let me get back to into the proposal after the brief interruption . 
UNKNOWN Um so the names are in red . 
UNKNOWN Now um well , one of the reasons at least for me for doing this was to more or less group people uh with within projects , because I I think that sometimes they ju they just discuss together and uh it's easier if they are in the same office . 
UNKNOWN And um which is quite happy actually , I I also thought that some professors might enjoy , or at least uh don't don't say anything about , being with their assistants . 
UNKNOWN So I was happy to hear Susan uh saying that Maggie and Bruno could well together , and Pierrette and uh Marianne in in the same office . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um so what I can say is uh that I also understood that Susan would be rather in favour of uh , well , having her own office , so uh it's it's it's working like this . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN I put the lounge in the middle . 
UNKNOWN It's also one of the rooms with the fewer uh the fewest uh windows . 
UNKNOWN So I think that's not a problem , because you're not going to just stay there and stare outside . 
UNKNOWN Uh but it's it's nicer to have a nicer view from your office , I guess . 
UNKNOWN I don't know . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , maybe , I thought in an angle , but that's obviously not very Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It's not a question where it is , it's a question of you are printing all the time so uh Yeah , that's that's a possible . 
UNKNOWN No yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , why not put the printer out in the hallway ? 
UNKNOWN Okay and so next to the photocopy maybe it wouldn't be a bad place . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Here ? 
UNKNOWN Why not ? 
UNKNOWN It is there enough space there for a photocopy and printer . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , we'll have to check tha yeah , but the printer is quite small if we fi find just a small table for it . 
UNKNOWN The photocopy is a bit big . 
UNKNOWN maybe one day we'll have a photocopy that is also a printer . 
UNKNOWN So okay , but uh I wouldn't well insist on this I think okay , so the printer , well , we'll remove it if we work from this uh this solution . 
UNKNOWN So uh I_M_two is more or less in the upper left side . 
UNKNOWN Um I said more or less um uh upper uh lower left side uh you have SwissTra and , so the two projects from the list . 
UNKNOWN And then on the on the right side . 
UNKNOWN Maybe not a ver a very good solution for Gisella . 
UNKNOWN If you can suggest something uh better , because she's with two people who uh well , two P_H_D_ students , and it's true that she has , yeah , a lot of phone calls to make , but um it's some way to to solve some constraints . 
UNKNOWN I think this is a very open thing . 
UNKNOWN Uh if you want we can use this documentor we could just , say , first listen to your suggestions and see if we erase everything or just do some modifications using this one . 
UNKNOWN Well , I've a question . 
UNKNOWN What's the justification for giving Nancy her own office ? 
UNKNOWN Um yeah , maybe not a very strong one . 
UNKNOWN Then they maybe you are you have better suggestions . 
UNKNOWN Um it was I think sort of one of the uh places they re that remain and I I think , yeah , there is no strong constraint and uh well , she's a smoker , but the policy is that we don't smoke , so it's even better if she's uh with a second person . 
UNKNOWN Mm doesn't help , yeah . 
UNKNOWN uh I would have I would have a provocative suggestion to put Gisella to switch Nancy and Gisella . 
UNKNOWN Uh-huh . 
UNKNOWN Put Gisella , the fax , and the printing machine the printer in the one person room as a as a Okay , so the printer that's that's not the s not the hard constraint but uh 'Cause I really do think it's important to have an admin room clearly identified as an admin room and only an admin room , where you have files , where yeah , you can close it , you have the personal files of the of the people of the of the of the unit etcetera , etcetera . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Uh-huh . 
UNKNOWN Well , Gisella will not be very happy about that uh . 
UNKNOWN We tried that and Gisella really didn't like to have a printer and people in and out all the time and uh Uh remember Andrei , that was uh yeah yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah mm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that was the case and uh she was a bit uh reluctant , but Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , we could store files there and things like that . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so if you want I can already do this change here . 
UNKNOWN So for instance I be fully against the fact that my personal files are in f in a in a room that is not specifically dedicated for that . 
UNKNOWN Because the professors uh , you have personal printer or there is only one printer ? 
UNKNOWN Sorry you're Um . 
UNKNOWN Because if not the person the printer can go in a room of three people . 
UNKNOWN That's typical of case where there's the lab and there's the printer is there . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN printer can be in the in the in the corridor . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , th yeah th when the printer is , yeah , it's it's the main one . 
UNKNOWN . 
UNKNOWN That's uh that's uh that's perfectly alright . 
UNKNOWN We have a secondary one which we could try to accommodate in another room , but it's basically , yeah , the peop the the printer where everybody prints . 
UNKNOWN Um so I change this . 
UNKNOWN So maybe I would suggest let me le k can I hear also let us hear from you . 
UNKNOWN And then if we can work out a solu a common solution from this one , then we go back to to this slide. 
UNKNOWN And if not , um we'll just , well start from scratch . 
UNKNOWN I'm perfectly alright to share the room with you has a view on the old town . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN That's um You have to be aware of what I was saying last time was that you have to suffer some suffer from fro from phone calls . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Lot's of phone calls . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I'll try . 
UNKNOWN I'll bring my walkman and uh Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So if you have a walkman that's that's good . 
UNKNOWN Earplugs uh whatever . 
UNKNOWN Uh David , you had also uh what's Ah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , okay , for me uh , as uh I don't know l uh the people a lot , uh you suggested that uh there's a la a lack of men s so , I would re certainly put uh not two men in the same office . 
UNKNOWN I would try to share them with the women so uh for example in your slideI could uh switch either you or Martin with uh uh the other room . 
UNKNOWN This one . 
UNKNOWN Uh-huh . 
UNKNOWN Oh let me put the plan , sorry . 
UNKNOWN So . 
UNKNOWN I will display uh yeah , this is the empty one . 
UNKNOWN Yes please . 
UNKNOWN I don't want to influence you . 
UNKNOWN So so you would put uh Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So , yeah , you have to show us which one you were talking about David , we didn't Ah the centre room . 
UNKNOWN Yeah yeah , I was wanting to change this wa Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN you can you can even stand and just show us there . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but I need your uh your slide, because I was talking about your slide. 
UNKNOWN Okay , so we would prefer the names . 
UNKNOWN Okay I I don't want to influence you too much , but uh mm I'm perfectly happy to start with this as the basis and then change things . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , because there are plenty of things that are that are okay so uh Yeah but for Pierrette an and Maggie it's uh it's . 
UNKNOWN Yes , so here you can see that the the the men is I mean , they are always sh sharing the room with a g with a woman . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , maybe in different , just Uh-huh . 
UNKNOWN I mean , there's Bruno , me , uh Pierrette and Nikos is a guy also . 
UNKNOWN Oh Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN It's a wish or it's uh it's because they I didn't get your solution . 
UNKNOWN Or actually , Pierrette is a woman too . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN Yeah , it's the feminine of Pierre . 
UNKNOWN Sorry for this . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So I mean , this is perfectly fine , I will just send Martin and Andrei for Maria or or Yalina or Nancy , maybe . 
UNKNOWN So Yeah , here there are two men . 
UNKNOWN What was it again ? 
UNKNOWN So ? 
UNKNOWN So I mea yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh he wants to mix sexes . 
UNKNOWN Uh-huh . 
UNKNOWN I it's nice . 
UNKNOWN Ah , okay . 
UNKNOWN I don't think I mean there's a lack of men here , in in in this in this lab . 
UNKNOWN bad . 
UNKNOWN So I would change one , switch one . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But that's not so much a question of uh men or women , it's more the question of , as I said , that's uh Um here you have only P_ you have P_H_D_ students that are a group . 
UNKNOWN There you have s senior researchers that are a group , which is to me more Unless it corresponds to some specific demand like it is in the case in Maggie Maggie's case and Pierrette's case . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think that's a very efficient way of doing things , because Yeah , mm I'm perfectly happy with with Andrei so . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , and for me it's also uh I would prefer maybe not to be in a three person office , just to be a bit calmer , and , Martin , so I'm very happy with you since I proposed it . 
UNKNOWN . 
UNKNOWN But I could also be happy with most of the other people , so even in a three person room . 
UNKNOWN Sure but um But isn't there just a a a question of proximity you put David with Agnes ? 
UNKNOWN It's it's fine . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so let's keep in mind , maybe , this uh constraint of balancing the the genders uh we'll see if we can uh do something for it . 
UNKNOWN Andrei did you ask these people if this was okay with them ? 
UNKNOWN Uh I've asked some of them , and I've also used a little bit uh what I've well , I mean the the present arrangement , just not to to shock people too much . 
UNKNOWN And it's also people that I know um get on well quite quite well together , and also work on the same project , like for instance , Marianne , uh uh the Finnish Marianne , and uh Nikos who interact quite a lot on uh on . 
UNKNOWN Um , yeah , Maria and Yalina seem uh to go on one quite quite well . 
UNKNOWN Uh Nancy had no strong preference , specially since she's no longer allowed to smoke in in her office . 
UNKNOWN Um yeah , so I think , well , at least as far as I I asked there was no major objection . 
UNKNOWN Um but isn't Agnes working um in a in a more substantial way in uh with people like uh either Maria or Yalina ? 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's true . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN That's true . 
UNKNOWN I um so we could put Nancy with David and uh put Agnes yeah . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause Yeah , yeah , I I know . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but Agnes is also working with David , so Yeah , but there's Yeah , but that doesn't mat that's not important . 
UNKNOWN but we agree that it's not important to to share the room with someone that has the same project . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN No , that's true that's true . 
UNKNOWN the other constraints are are satisfied somehow so . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN quite happy to have the the full room some fifty per cent of the time . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's a small advantage and uh I it's a bit more uh more comfortable , actually . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN No but what I mean it was was the three the two three person rooms , I think that they can mix them the way they want . 
UNKNOWN I mean if they prefer to be uh Maria tha uh Yalina and Nikos , and Nancy and Marianne on the other side well , no that's not completely equivalent , because Nancy all are P_H_D_ students or masters students , but Nancy . 
UNKNOWN Correct ? 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN There w one question I was wondering about though , 'cause three is always uh well the more people in a office uh the less ideal , that wouldn't it maybe be better to put David in , since he's only half-time . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , maybe . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So that way , then there's not three people all the time . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Very good . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So I would switch David and Nancy typically . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , probably Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Which doesn't mean that David should be in this room . 
UNKNOWN He could be in the other one . 
UNKNOWN For me uh the two three people rooms are really they have to be uh re-shuffled according to people personal preferences . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So Agnes has worked Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN But I definitely would put uh Nancy with Agnes in the two person room . 
UNKNOWN They they have worked together on , so this makes some sense . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um at yeah , I mean Yeah , as far as I know I think it's probably quite a good uh uh good match . 
UNKNOWN But again , it's also a question of personal preference . 
UNKNOWN I mean you you can't be in a room with person you don't want to be with . 
UNKNOWN Is there anyone that is going to finish P_H_D_ or or leave or . 
UNKNOWN Uh no . 
UNKNOWN Uh Maria is Maria is the closest , but she's still not uh uh yeah . 
UNKNOWN First one should be Maria , but it's still uh one and a half . 
UNKNOWN Okay , let's switch uh Mm-hmm , yeah . 
UNKNOWN I see if you do it this way , you mean that in the two three people room there will be one that is not so overloaded , because of David , because David will be part time and the other one not so overloaded , because there is uh one free position uh , knowing that this one free position uh will not stay free very long . 
UNKNOWN No , because don't forget we already have somebody coming in uh January . 
UNKNOWN Yes so And this is still a worry for me , because we are still we don't still still don't have enough space for the visitors . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN At least one person . 
UNKNOWN I'll just uh Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Unless we put them in the lounge . 
UNKNOWN Mm yeah , I I don't think Yeah , so s s okay so since we are supposed to do a final proposal . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Therefore I w Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Or we make four space in the three people rooom . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN We need to have at least three visitors' position , because positions , because Outside . 
UNKNOWN Sorry , uh let me move the printer um next to the photocopier . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN And we'll find some way to um , well , attach it to a wall or something like this . 
UNKNOWN So that we keep it , you mean . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I think so , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um okay , so that's the uh mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Uh I don't think we can put visitors in the lounge , it's uh Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It depends it depends on how we think about the lounge . 
UNKNOWN If it's thought as being a reading room . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN If it's thought as the que that that's really a very important question to me . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Do we do we put priority on the fact of being able to read newspapers in our in our offices or in our uh work place ? 
UNKNOWN We can read newspapers elsewhere . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN And I really do think it's more important for lab to be able to decently uh welcome visitors that come to the lab than to have a place for reading newspapers . 
UNKNOWN Newspapers you can read them home . 
UNKNOWN know we can go to the cafeteria or you can sit somewhere else . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN You can go on the balcony if it's if it's in the summer . 
UNKNOWN So I I don't understand why we why we should put priority on lounges if we if we don't have enough space for accommodating visitors . 
UNKNOWN It's Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN That's just not not according to my priorities . 
UNKNOWN How how would it be to put the lounge in one of the smaller offices ? 
UNKNOWN Like in , well , in in one of the one person offices ? 
UNKNOWN W I I know they are actually quite uh quite demanded , so um I th I think , Susan , you are very happy with this solution , so okay . 
UNKNOWN Yes , yes . 
UNKNOWN S so let's let's put the lounge in Susan's office , and Susan's in Susan in the lounge with three visitors mm ? 
UNKNOWN In Gisell Yeah , it's probably too small . 
UNKNOWN That's an excellent idea . 
UNKNOWN No , but a lounge in a one person room is really too small . 
UNKNOWN It's too small for a uh yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay , yeah , doesn't work . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN I would advocate to just remove the lounge . 
UNKNOWN We it's a luxury for us . 
UNKNOWN We don't have space for a lounge . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN It's let's be you you cannot you cannot go at the at the at the at the in front of your colleagues and saying , I p if I have to choose between uh reading my newspaper and disc and having a a decently welcomed uh v uh research visitor , I prefer to read my newspaper . 
UNKNOWN Okay , let's be innovative . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN That's just not that's just not realistic . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN I mean , we are researchers . 
UNKNOWN But the problem is it it has been decided by everyone and approved by the school that we we need the lounge , so I I think it's simply not No actually , uh I I'm sorry , it's uh yeah . 
UNKNOWN No no , I don't think we can choose . 
UNKNOWN But then ? 
UNKNOWN Then you have the three people room , that positions , split it in two parts as as Susan was was uh proposing last time was a ha was a wall and you have a lounge there can read your newspapers and we have a full two room two person room where we can certainly accommodate three visitors . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN And at least we have some uh free margin for the next two years , or the next year . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN Okay so so how do we split the room ? 
UNKNOWN The the three people over there . 
UNKNOWN We put it the the furniture that we got for our reading room , we put it into the other half of the three person room . 
UNKNOWN This one . 
UNKNOWN Uh-huh . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And put uh uh mm They are not supposed to have a discussion in the lounge , they are supposed to read their newspapers . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Would that fit ? 
UNKNOWN So Yeah . 
UNKNOWN A little divider of some kind . 
UNKNOWN But what about if people want to have a small discussion in the lounge ? 
UNKNOWN And to drink their coffee . 
UNKNOWN Well , not the newspapers , because no scientific articles . 
UNKNOWN Well not just newspapers . 
UNKNOWN Uh scientific articles . 
UNKNOWN No that's not that wasn't the goal . 
UNKNOWN Journals . 
UNKNOWN The the goal of the lounge was was a place where you can relax . 
UNKNOWN Uh-huh . 
UNKNOWN But also to read articles . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN you can do it in your office . 
UNKNOWN So you would like to put it , yeah , within yeah , and then who who yeah . 
UNKNOWN it's it's it's you have a good chairs to read newspapers that you don't want to break you heart your your your your back your office . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah okay , but then that means that we'll put the lounge on the right side , uh here . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN And uh here we'll put two places for visitors . 
UNKNOWN Three . 
UNKNOWN Three . 
UNKNOWN But that means the office will be at least for the moment empty . 
UNKNOWN That looks very bad . 
UNKNOWN No , we have our visitor that is arriving . 
UNKNOWN Uh what did you say , Susan ? 
UNKNOWN It's not a visitor . 
UNKNOWN It's a a new p p full-time person arriving in January . 
UNKNOWN uh okay . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so that could take the the free place over there . 
UNKNOWN Uh I mean Yeah , I think okay , so we need what , two , three positions and one new person arriving , X_ or something like that . 
UNKNOWN No , that's where we're gonna put the lounge . 
UNKNOWN No no . 
UNKNOWN That could take one one positions in the in the lo in the Ah okay , that that's an idea . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN Let's put m Maria or Yalina in the in the in this place . 
UNKNOWN Well for No no no no , we we have to Yeah yeah yeah . 
UNKNOWN if if if if you forget about the lounge . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN What you could do is to move either Mari Maria or Yalina in the in the mm what is currently the lounge . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN That means that we have one person there with one free position . 
UNKNOWN We have one free position in the in the room that Maria or Yalina is coming from and one free position over there . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So we have three position distributed over the rooms where we can accommodate No lounge . 
UNKNOWN And and where is the lounge ? 
UNKNOWN No lounge . 
UNKNOWN No okay , no way . 
UNKNOWN I'll I'll have my head cut off if we don't have a lounge . 
UNKNOWN Louge . 
UNKNOWN You take the furniture of the lounge and you put it in the corridor . 
UNKNOWN So uh No no no no , let's do the lounge corner . 
UNKNOWN No , there's no space . 
UNKNOWN The lounge is in the free space . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN At least . 
UNKNOWN I mean otherwise I cannot really defend it , because it it was agreed and we cannot just come back on every every decision we made . 
UNKNOWN After all that we went through to get the budget for it , we really have to uh No , wait a minute, yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I think so , yeah . 
UNKNOWN you you will explain to your visitors that unfortunately they have a position in the toilet , because there is a reading room where people have to relax . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Well , let's have the visitors first . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so what we need is a new and two . 
UNKNOWN So I think we can put , what , Maria or Yalina ? 
UNKNOWN I don't want to separate them really , but uh Oh . 
UNKNOWN Mysel , I don't like that office actually . 
UNKNOWN Um so I was thinking to put here Yeah , now . 
UNKNOWN It could be Nikos , for instance . 
UNKNOWN Could put you can switch . 
UNKNOWN No , we are not gonna keep Marianne in a three uh person place uh , just having Marianne in the lounge . 
UNKNOWN But it's a lounge . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN so it's either Y we could put the visitor with you , Martin , but it's probably okay , let's try le let's try this . 
UNKNOWN Yeah but then Yeah you could you could put me there . 
UNKNOWN Uh let's try Maria here . 
UNKNOWN I mean , Andrei . 
UNKNOWN Oh , you don't mind ? 
UNKNOWN Because I will be there half time , and the visitors probably will not so much complain about phone calls . 
UNKNOWN Perfect . 
UNKNOWN But wait a minute, then Andrei has a two person office all for himself . 
UNKNOWN No no , we'll put a visitor place in there . 
UNKNOWN If you don't mind . 
UNKNOWN Well there is this full-time person arriving in I I think it's really important to to plan with that . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Wha what's what's her name again , Andrei ? 
UNKNOWN Uh I think it's Paola . 
UNKNOWN Paola . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN would it be possible to have Paola in your office ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , could be . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause that's that's something that we we should be deciding . 
UNKNOWN If Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Either you want to keep me in your office , which is alright , and then we have to forsee a place for Paola somewhere . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN No , I I would prefer you , I think . 
UNKNOWN I I think that's that's not realistic to have a planning Why didn Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay , let me keep you . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Martin goes back to Andrei . 
UNKNOWN Okay , we'll put Paola and a visitor here . 
UNKNOWN So Paola is the new person . 
UNKNOWN And a visitor , uh vis . 
UNKNOWN That's visitor one . 
UNKNOWN Is that vis one ? 
UNKNOWN And then we'll we'll still have probably some way to put a second visitor here . 
UNKNOWN Vis two . 
UNKNOWN Oops . 
UNKNOWN Sorry , it's not very nice , but Does this display better ? 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Um Paola well , Paola being new , I I think it would be better to put her with somebody else . 
UNKNOWN I think it's not bad . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , don't put her alone . 
UNKNOWN somebody else . 
UNKNOWN Uh-huh . 
UNKNOWN Well , the the lounge can not be in here t with two people . 
UNKNOWN I mean , you cannot go there and discuss and and two people working there in the room . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Not supposed to discuss , you are supposed to relax . 
UNKNOWN No , but we said that we won't discuss or maybe if we organise some kind of , you know , coffee at the end of the day , or a drink , then the two people will stop working . 
UNKNOWN I don't know , maybe they won't be happy . 
UNKNOWN Okay then , Martin let let me put you in that office and I'll put Paola with me . 
UNKNOWN Sure not me . 
UNKNOWN No no put why not Maria or Yalina ? 
UNKNOWN No ? 
UNKNOWN So Martin goes where ? 
UNKNOWN Martin stays . 
UNKNOWN Maria's . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Because you don't want to separate Ma Maria and Yalina ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Why ? 
UNKNOWN 'Cause Yalina , i it's not even sure she stays . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's true . 
UNKNOWN It's a master student so uh Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so let's put Maria in the separate office . 
UNKNOWN And we have , yeah , and we have two visitors and a masters student and a p and a part-time person . 
UNKNOWN And we have Paola . 
UNKNOWN I was thinking the other way around . 
UNKNOWN Oh sorry , what were you thinking ? 
UNKNOWN To keep Paola with Maria in the two people room and to have this one with two , Yalina and David in the three people room . 
UNKNOWN So who is with Maria here ? 
UNKNOWN Paola . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And no visitor ? 
UNKNOWN No , that's a two people room , so Yep . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but that means that this room , the middle one , would be quite empty . 
UNKNOWN All the I mean , two visitors and the fifty per cent pers person , I don't think it's very uh reasonable . 
UNKNOWN No , Yalina is there , David is there but you need to have to put visitors somewhere , I mean uh Ah . 
UNKNOWN Well , we have Uh yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but let's split them a little bit , so that when there are no visitors , at least people are Yeah , I think so . 
UNKNOWN No , the rooms have to look like they're sort of occupied uh . 
UNKNOWN Oterwise , we might uh lose room or two . 
SURPRISE Oh .
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So this goes here goes visitor two . 
UNKNOWN That's true . 
UNKNOWN This is always the game . 
UNKNOWN Paola is there . 
UNKNOWN Here goes visitor one . 
UNKNOWN And is this better ? 
UNKNOWN Except that we cannot read it , but apart from this Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Well It's a little bit crowded in . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause you have well , not yet , of course , because Paola is not has not arrived , but uh starting from January , you will have two full-time person plus one part-time person plus one visitor that's 'Kay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , okay . 
UNKNOWN Let me call this visitor one , which implies that uh it will be the first one occupied by a visitor when they come . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN And this visitor two which means it's like a , well , you know , second uh second chance . 
UNKNOWN But why couldn't we basically Move you , David , in this two people room with Maria ? 
UNKNOWN Or we could . 
UNKNOWN What would this change ? 
UNKNOWN Maria plus one half pa uh half-time person ? 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN And you have Paola , Yalina , one visitor position , and I still keep hope that uh Marianne , Nikos that the lounge will on the , on on the on the long term disappear , because anyhow I don't believe there can be a lounge where in a place where there are already two people working . 
UNKNOWN So the lounge will just die after some point and it uh it Still , I mean , . 
UNKNOWN No , but but look , Martin , it's quite a long room , it has two doors Yeah , the occupancy is better that way . 
UNKNOWN Ah okay , ah it has two doors . 
UNKNOWN Oh yeah , very good . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's true . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , so maybe in the long run we'll get a wall . 
UNKNOWN Ah yeah , but then then yeah , okay okay . 
UNKNOWN Okay , that's true . 
UNKNOWN 'Kay then then there will be a wall . 
UNKNOWN Uh-huh . 
UNKNOWN Al although there are three windows , but um okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's good . 
UNKNOWN So where would we move David to Maria Da with Maria . 
UNKNOWN Do you have any preferences , David ? 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Uh it's completely fine . 
UNKNOWN Uh she she wa she wants mixing peo uh men and women , so or she he . 
UNKNOWN Well , he already is mixed . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , right . 
UNKNOWN So , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Then uh the two visitors will be in one room , but doesn't that's fine , because maybe there are not two visitors at the same time . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's to me it's more realistic . 
UNKNOWN Uh we'll see . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I wouldn't put the two visitors in the same room , because when there is no one it makes a big hole , and when there are two people , so it makes too many variations , but Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but then then you can you can move for instance if you move David to uh with Maria . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Then I think it's it's better . 
UNKNOWN You prefer that too , Susan ? 
UNKNOWN Because there is regular there is regular occupancy , yeah . 
UNKNOWN First it's better . 
UNKNOWN I think it's uh , because it's more it's stabler . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause visitors stay and go . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Oops . 
UNKNOWN Sorry . 
UNKNOWN Uh what did we say here ? 
UNKNOWN This one . 
UNKNOWN one . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's good . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , my uh Okay . 
UNKNOWN To me that's the best we can do . 
UNKNOWN If you if we realistically can plan to have a lounge . 
UNKNOWN Well , I think that was really decided and it's it's no we no , because , actually if we do a proposal without a lounge , and , you know , the other group will Yeah , exactly , and that means that all the constraints that we said and uh all the other things just , we we well , just basically disappear . 
UNKNOWN Okay okay okay . 
UNKNOWN We won't be very credible . 
UNKNOWN I go I got the message . 
UNKNOWN Yes , sir . 
UNKNOWN Uh-huh , which means we've worked for nothing . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Uh what's what's wrong with this ? 
UNKNOWN So who has strong strong opposition to that ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Uh , I don't . 
UNKNOWN Oh , you have to go , Susan ? 
UNKNOWN I'll be right back . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN But do you have any no . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , well , we are almost done , Susan , but uh we we'll we'll just check the the items . 
UNKNOWN I I just need to see somebody . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , please . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN But it's just a decision . 
UNKNOWN No problem . 
UNKNOWN No , you just have . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , we we'll just review the items to see is we look at all the constraints and then you'll be able to say the final uh yes or no . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN I think we we we accommodated most of the constraints . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause uh we are sure that Maggie and Bruno uh Maggie is happy with having Bruno in her office and Pierrette is happy to have uh Marianne in her office . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I think that's okay . 
UNKNOWN That's that that checked ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , we checked . 
UNKNOWN And , yes , and no reason to think that there should be uh uh uh uh an impossible situation ? 
CONFUSION Uh . 
UNKNOWN I don't think so . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN Same thing for Marianne and Marianne F_ and Nikos ? 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Uh Paola we don't know yet , because she didn't arrived yet . 
UNKNOWN And uh , well , Yalina Aha , that means for a for a short time Yalina will be just alone in the three person room . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's a bit yeah , that was the point in letting David there and but okay , maybe we'll just leave it as an option . 
UNKNOWN That's a bit a problem . 
UNKNOWN David or visitor one or two . 
UNKNOWN Ah but then then we what we could just for the sake of having a defendable solution , uh as long as Paola is not has not arrived , is to switch for the proposal Paola and David But we we really plan that as soon as Paola is here or even earlier David will go to the to the two people room . 
UNKNOWN It's uh Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So we'll know that uh that the region actually around here is probably movable . 
UNKNOWN It's just it will be switched . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , either , yeah , we can switch Maria or Paola or David . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause this this this this is dangerous to propose . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I mean you have a three per three person room with one masters student in it . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Okay ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , no , exactly . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , tha tha yeah , that's why I always try to put the to separate the visitors , just to balance a little bit . 
UNKNOWN So I wouldn't I wouldn't propose that . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN But okay , we'll uh , we'll be open on on that point . 
UNKNOWN But as soon as Paola is here , uh it starts to be better . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , it will become Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN And we will have visitors , for sure . 
UNKNOWN Or it depends also on well , if Yalina stays longer or not , which is not yet very clear , but um Okay , w we'll see . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , right right , that's true . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Oh yeah , that's a point , true . 
UNKNOWN Ah do we have a do do we know do we know when when is she supposed to finish the her uh master thesis ? 
UNKNOWN Anyway , we'll we'll be open . 
UNKNOWN Mm I don't really know , I think her master thesis is probably due um no , I would say , yeah , maybe June next year ? 
UNKNOWN In June ? 
UNKNOWN June next year . 
UNKNOWN At the latest . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Actually I don't know , unfortunately . 
UNKNOWN Okay , wha when when do we when do you when whe uh when are we supposed to sub sumbit the proposal ? 
UNKNOWN Well , we we won't have any extra meeting , well , the four of us , so , yeah , this one has to to be the the final one . 
UNKNOWN 'Kay , that's now . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um so um we'll we'll have actually I I'll present this to , well , with the other , I'll compare it with the other one , and uh try to make a decision actually . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN I think it's even uh a bit later , or in two days , or something like this . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Well so as soon as we have Susan we can uh we can um so I would I would switch again . 
UNKNOWN Again , okay . 
UNKNOWN Da but that , as I say , it's just for the sake of the of the proposition , so I even I'm even ready to uh to internally say that David will actually be in this room . 
UNKNOWN We yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN W we can leave it like this and then Uh , yeah , there will be names on the doors . 
UNKNOWN What does it what does it change ? 
UNKNOWN names on the doors ? 
UNKNOWN Aha , so if we 'cause , Susan , the the the the problem the let's say the techn not the technical , the psy psychological problem we have is pra I'm extremenly happy with that solution . 
UNKNOWN Sorry , yeah . 
UNKNOWN It would be a workab work working solution starting from January , when Paola will be here . 
UNKNOWN But currently if we present it as it is , we have a three person room that is only occupied by a masters student . 
UNKNOWN No , because there is another person right now , a student that I just uh um hired . 
UNKNOWN And she's just working right now for uh for November and December , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Aha , so sh you have a student . 
UNKNOWN So she'll be a visitor . 
UNKNOWN That we that's a rea real visitor to some extent . 
UNKNOWN A she uh she's a she's a real visitor . 
UNKNOWN She's a real visitor that I just made a contract for her for two months . 
UNKNOWN Ah , so this one and this two one are just ah okay , okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So then we would have two people there . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , we'll we'll keep it like this . 
UNKNOWN Yeah then that works . 
UNKNOWN Um okay I , well , I'll try to to express all these constraints and uh and say in particular that the two rooms over here actually are sort of uh , well , s things could be changed over there , but on some other sides Yeah , the visitor space , yeah , I'll uh Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but you you really have also to say that that that a a unit has to has to have some some horizon . 
UNKNOWN I mean uh it's it's it's it's extremely important in the research domain that we can have people coming to visit us . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , uh that's true . 
UNKNOWN Uh the second point I would suggest is that before you go to defend it , you should uh mm circulate it uh over mailto all the all the con involved people . 
UNKNOWN And Well , I think this I I'm not very sure , but I think this will be done after the meeting , when okay . 
UNKNOWN To double-check so that I would do it before . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause you if you if you spend time defending a thing then um I don't know , Agnes comes to you or Pierrette comes to you saying it , no I don't want to be with Marianne . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Uh-huh . 
UNKNOWN Uh what do you do ? 
UNKNOWN A as far as know I think Agnes is also taking care of a proposal so okay , yeah , I'll circulate this . 
UNKNOWN So so it doesn't cost anything , it's just people will look at it , say oh , great , I have a view on the mountain and I'm uh with a person I like , so I'm happy . 
UNKNOWN Perfect . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , exactly . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so maybe we'll learn some more constraints . 
UNKNOWN Um okay . 
UNKNOWN What's the timeline on this now ? 
UNKNOWN So you have a meeting when ? 
UNKNOWN Um yeah , actually as I as I told uh Martin um , well , this is the last time we meet , so uh this is , well , more or less our proposal , and uh we'll have a meeting , I think , it's uh it's in two days or something like that . 
UNKNOWN Uh to discuss and compare with the other proposal and uh , well , make a final decision . 
UNKNOWN Because Yeah , it's it's it's not it's not completely it's an important issue , because uh I need to know , when I will have the office decided , the phone number decided . 
UNKNOWN Actually , probably a pre-final one , since we'll have to check again with everyone . 
UNKNOWN But uh Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Because these are information that I have to provide to administration . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Oh , yeah . 
UNKNOWN I'm reachable when I'm at uh well , they can phone me on the mobile , but uh I would definitely prefer to have a clean filled administrative form that I can give back . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Well , so actually I think , I I'm not very sure , but the most important thing is , well , finding out when we will move and this happens in probably , I think , next month or depends also on how , well , the uh the furnishing and uh well goes on . 
UNKNOWN Yes , yes . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN And then uh of course you have these all these practical issues , how about internet connections ? 
UNKNOWN . 
UNKNOWN Well uh , network connections , I mean ? 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN How many connections are there per room ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , because that's also something double check . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN You know , if you are in a room with three people and one network connection Well no no um . 
UNKNOWN Oh no no no . 
UNKNOWN No the roo the the building is very no actually I've seen it . 
UNKNOWN Uh the building is very modern and uh you can have actually we'll get them activated , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN But are they activated ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN A and I think you get at least th yeah , three per room . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So uh or probably more than that . 
UNKNOWN No , get the uh for the the bigger rooms you get double for every workplace you get two lines . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah yeah , you need , because sometimes you need a laptop and So you agree with a lounge ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Ah okay . 
UNKNOWN Good that looks good . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , sometimes he needs two two computers . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN No , because lots of people have , you know , they have a Sun and they have a a PC , so Well , we have to say how many places that we want to have . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , no this this . 
UNKNOWN And if you go back to the uh to the uh other sli slidewhere you have the furniture so with this uh we do we have any m any any word to say and uh so that I would like to have a red chair or a blue desk uh or a So that's the standard things . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Oh no , unfortunately that's decided by the uh the school , so the the chairs are blue , the the desk is uh is brow , well , light-brown . 
UNKNOWN But do we have to order something or is it done automatically , so it will be in the office when we move in ? 
UNKNOWN And uh Uh , normally it's done automatically , except that we'll have to think Yeah , uh well , these are dictated by the names . 
UNKNOWN Uh it's probably more difficult for the lounge . 
UNKNOWN What we'll have is have a bit less furniture in the lounge and then bring all the , well the old it's not old , because we just bought it , but uh all the furniture from the previous lounge we'll we'll bring it here . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN And how about the boxes , because at you have to say when you will be moving the boxes , so that you have uh people for moving them . 
CONFUSION Uh . 
UNKNOWN Or here you're supposed to move them yourself , or So we'll receive some information about that ? 
UNKNOWN Well , it's the faculty that will take care of uh Yeah , yeah , I think yeah , i I mean it's a completely different issue from uh , you know , arranging people . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , they'll just give us a date when The well , there is downstairs in the building and pretty soon the whole building will be covered . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN It's just uh how the moving will take place . 
UNKNOWN That's true , but uh right , right , right . 
UNKNOWN And there are things to to take care of , but uh it's uh quite unrelated with these things . 
UNKNOWN . 
UNKNOWN Okay , okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , we'll get uh we'll get all the information . 
UNKNOWN Uh thinking about internet connections , I think it's quite okay for the the for the the printer to be there . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's an important point , the the printer needs to be connected . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I think it's i it's feasible . 
UNKNOWN We'll we'll check . 
UNKNOWN So the the violet box here is uh uh our mailboxes also . 
UNKNOWN By the way uh uh is there any uh wireless connection uh antennas for getting 'cause I I've I've heard that there is one downstairs in the that But that's important . 
UNKNOWN Um not at the sixth floor . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah no not not in the building for the moment . 
UNKNOWN I mean not at this Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN I mean , typically for the laptops it's Ah okay , good . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but right now in uh downstairs it's fine . 
UNKNOWN Some people can pick it up on sixth floor . 
UNKNOWN But pretty soon the whole building will be covered . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Well , I think it's a bit off topic already . 
UNKNOWN Yeah yeah , . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , okay . 
UNKNOWN So um let's say that i it's a proposal . 
UNKNOWN We'll try it I'm , well I'll try to to express the the constraints and uh your opinions and uh well , I think , finally everyone can veto something if there is a huge problem , but I think with this we we don't run into huge problems . 
UNKNOWN Mm ? 
CONFIRMATION Sure . 
UNKNOWN At least the four of us will not veto . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , obviously . 
UNKNOWN at least . 
UNKNOWN So let me save this . 
UNKNOWN . 
UNKNOWN And thank you for spending all this time . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Hope you're all happy . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN . 
UNKNOWN Uh I guess I start with my presentation. 
UNKNOWN We had two groups of people working on this . 
UNKNOWN So we'll show you two slightly different presentations. 
UNKNOWN Feel free to ask any questions or comments , obviously . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um the first one was done by myself , Bruno , Marianne and Nikos . 
UNKNOWN And the rationale that we have , I'll show you the layoutin a second , was that full professors would get private offices . 
UNKNOWN Administration is close to the professors offices , so it's easier for the secretary to speak to everyone . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN The fax is in the administration office , since it's mostly used by Gisella , who's the secretary . 
UNKNOWN For noise reduction purposes we've moved everyone who has office hours together , and we've also put the network printer and the photocopier in the hall . 
UNKNOWN Um , so I'll just show you how that works . 
UNKNOWN Basically , you can see Gisella sort of there in the middle with the fax machine , and Maggie and Susan , who are the two full professors in our department have the private offices . 
UNKNOWN And the photocopier and the printer are sort of in the hall on the side there across from mailboxes . 
UNKNOWN Um , just to go back , most people are grouped in projects . 
UNKNOWN And we have two fifty per cent people who are half time in Geneva , half time at the E_P_F_L_ in Lausanne . 
UNKNOWN And they m them we've put in three person offices , so that in the three person offices it's not constantly three people . 
UNKNOWN So there's a little bit of give there . 
UNKNOWN And the reading room , or the lounge as some people call it , that we have is in a central position . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So basically we've got Andre and Nancy at the top . 
UNKNOWN Um they don't actu they will be starting a new project together , if um if I'm not mistaken . 
UNKNOWN Like I said , Susan and Maggie in the individual offices . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Nikos and Yalina , who work on the same project , at the bottom . 
UNKNOWN The reading room is in the middle . 
UNKNOWN Um , Marianne and Bruno are at the bottom . 
UNKNOWN Um , as well , Marianne works closely with Pierrette and the other Marianne . 
UNKNOWN We have two Mariannes in our department . 
UNKNOWN And David is a half time . 
UNKNOWN So as I said , the half times are in the three person offices . 
UNKNOWN And on the other side we have Maria , Martin and myself , who all work on the same project . 
UNKNOWN And Martin is fifty per cent . 
UNKNOWN Um Gisella , we've given her two person office for two reasons , one is because there's a spare place there , so if we want to put a stagieur or someone who just comes in for short period of time , we figured it was okay if they were in the admin office which is a little bit noisy , because they're only there for a short period of time . 
UNKNOWN Um , and again the proximity to the other offices . 
UNKNOWN Um so I guess that's pretty much it for our proposal . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um I don't know if you want Andre to go through his first or if you have any questions for me . 
UNKNOWN So you sa so Pierrette is a professor , but she's only she's only fifty per cent time . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , Martin . 
UNKNOWN Is that why she's in a three person office ? 
UNKNOWN She's It's Do you wanna explain how it it works or Martin is fifty per cent . 
UNKNOWN Uh , actually Martin is fifty per cent time . 
UNKNOWN Mar Ah . 
UNKNOWN Uh-huh . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Pierrette , there's two sort of statutes of professor . 
UNKNOWN No ? 
UNKNOWN I guess you could say where there's Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Oh , because you would say that she's an assistant professor or something like that . 
UNKNOWN I see . 
CONFIRMATION Oh , okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But um yeah , maybe that's Yeah , there are full professors and assistant professors , if you want . 
UNKNOWN There's a professeur d'ecole and the But the idea is Maggie and Susan are sort of the senior um professors on staff so they got the the individual offices . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , ho Mm . 
UNKNOWN And , yeah , it's true that she's an assistant professor , but uh well , we see , maybe we can move a little bit around just to give her uh , well , also at least , maybe not a uh an office alone , but at least with just one person , not two . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN We'll see . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN And what what's happening what what do you foresee happening in the next couple of years , like beyond this m b beyond this current group of people , do we do we know of any changes coming ? 
UNKNOWN Is the department growing ? 
UNKNOWN Or is it is it going to be Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um the department will obviously be growing , but there are some people who only work part time , there's some people who are doing P_H_D_s or master students , who won't necessarily be there for a larger extent of time . 
UNKNOWN So for example , Yalina and the Finnish Marianne are master students for right now , so whether they decide to stay and do a P_H_D_ , we're not sure yet . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um , Nikos is working um as a researcher . 
UNKNOWN So for him it's the same thing . 
UNKNOWN There's I think the only constant people are Susan , Maggie , Andre , um Gisella , Pierrette , um and all the rest are either P_H_D_ students or master students . 
UNKNOWN And again Martin and David are half time with the E_P_F_L_ , so that's project dependent as well . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Unfortunately , we haven't been given as much space as we would have liked , but that's always the case . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN That's always the case . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN And have you have you talked to th any of these people to ask them if they have any special requirements ? 
UNKNOWN Um , Susan wanted a private office , she has a preference for private offices . 
SURPRISE Oh .
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Other than that , no one really had any tight constraints from what I've heard . 
UNKNOWN Of people they needed to be near or people they would needed to avoid or anything like that . 
UNKNOWN No one's explicitly said that they needed to avoid anyone else . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
UNKNOWN Um Yeah yeah yeah . 
UNKNOWN But you've given people chance to say that if they really needed to ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay , good . 
UNKNOWN But you no specific uh views for mountains or old town or I mean people prefer any windows . 
UNKNOWN No , they were fine with it , so And they're both nice views . 
SURPRISE Oh .
SURPRISE Oh .
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I guess those thin lines , or I mean they're windows or Okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , they're windows , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Or sorry , the thick lines are windows actually . 
UNKNOWN We have fairly big windows in the room , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Oh oh k okay oh 'kay . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So there's lots of light coming in . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN And one of the reasons for putting the reading room where it was is that you have a lot of light coming in , so if people just go somewhere to sort of relax and have a quiet place to sips sit , they have a lot of light and Yeah yeah . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN It says mountains . 
UNKNOWN Is that because that's the view . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah yeah . 
UNKNOWN So it's the best view . 
UNKNOWN You gave the reading room the best view ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , well I mean it depends if you like looking out over the old town and the cathedral . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN That sort of goes both ways , but , yeah , we've got two mountain views , sort of on that side , that side , and then the last part looks on the old town . 
UNKNOWN Oh , two mountain views . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Oh , and that's old town . 
UNKNOWN And then one of old town . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Because we're on the sixth floor , you can actually see everything , 'cause I don't think buildings are much higher than was it , six or eight floors ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , no , mountains are just in the far so , that's not Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN No , okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN What's that purple thing there ? 
UNKNOWN The purple thing is the mailboxes . 
CONFIRMATION Oh , okay . 
UNKNOWN And those are fixed , we can't do anything about those . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN So Um , r We don't have anything like that . 
UNKNOWN So you can't do any partitions ? 
UNKNOWN I mean , you plan to do any partitions in three p person rooms or like this kind of blocks ? 
UNKNOWN If we can get stuff like that , it might be a good idea . 
UNKNOWN Some people might like them . 
UNKNOWN At the moment we have people thre sharing like three people in a room , without any partitions and it's a little bit noisy , but people sort of get used to it and admittedly it's mostly assistants that are stuck in rooms like that , so it's junior people , but Well , do you want to do your presentationand Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , just three desks , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um well , uh I can think of some reactions from the people wi so maybe I can Well , r Yeah , well , tell me about some of the constraints and Well , first of all I must say that there are also quite a lot of common points , so um it's probably not going to be very difficult to Yeah , please . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Thanks . 
UNKNOWN Perfect . 
UNKNOWN So um , yeah , actually we um Well , basically the the group who produced this uh proposal is made by Susan , Martin , David and uh and myself . 
UNKNOWN And we also well , Susan volunteered to ask Maggie and Pierrette about how they they felt about sharing offices , and . 
UNKNOWN So , as you can see , well um Susan gets obviously the same office , which is quite a good thing . 
UNKNOWN Um , then things started move a bit . 
UNKNOWN It looks like I'm also in the same position . 
UNKNOWN But the most obvious constraints that uh we we found here was that it was probably very difficult to have a lounge uh just a lounge in one room , because it would block us two full working places . 
UNKNOWN And although it's true that the group , I agree , decided to to had to have a lounge , we propose to put the lounge uh in the room at the the upper side on on the right . 
UNKNOWN Uh , so let two people share this with uh sort of a , yeah , a place where we have a sofa maybe and uh and some books . 
UNKNOWN So it's obviously a calm place . 
UNKNOWN People are not there to talk very loud , but they can sit and relax , and uh still look at at the mountains . 
UNKNOWN Um , also So that's one of the main differences , I think , maybe one of the points that we have to talk about . 
UNKNOWN Uh the other one is the admin office . 
UNKNOWN So it's Gisella fifty per cent because she's only half time , and uh the fax machine . 
UNKNOWN Um Gisella actually has a lot of phone calls to make and uh it's true that her activity is quite noisy when she's there . 
UNKNOWN Um , it's also true that she has quite a lot of files for most of the the projects actually that we manage , so it appeared , at least to well to our group , that even if she's here only half time , she should have an office by her own because it would be quite disturbing for other people to to work in the the same office . 
UNKNOWN Uh Gisella has has no objection against sharing the office . 
UNKNOWN We thought it was more for the the calm of the the people . 
UNKNOWN It's true that this blocks one of the one person rooms , but uh on the other hand , uh Maggie has no objection uh sharing an office with her assistant . 
UNKNOWN And this appeared to be true also of Pierrette . 
UNKNOWN We don't know about Pierrette sharing an office with two persons , but at least no problem in Pierrette sharing her office with uh Marianne , the the Swedish one , who is sort of her assistant . 
UNKNOWN Um so this is why we , yeah , we put Maggie with with Bruno . 
UNKNOWN And then the third main difference uh would be the the number of visitor places or free places . 
UNKNOWN Uh you notice a new name in the room uh at the centre upper upper side . 
UNKNOWN So that's Paola . 
UNKNOWN It's true that it's someone coming next year , Susan reminded me this uh of this point , and I could not really ignore it . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Uh , so um that she's an Italic , she will arrive in about two month . 
UNKNOWN And the two uh , vis one and vis two , are the visitor places . 
UNKNOWN You had one , I think , called free space or spare spare place . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um we didn't really reach a very good agreement on the distribution of these two rooms . 
UNKNOWN So the the two at the centre , uh where is written Paola , Yalina , the two visitors and then Maria plus David . 
UNKNOWN So I think there is quite a lot of space here to uh switch a little bit among the people , just to make some kind of smooth occupancy rate , so not to have one empty room when we have no visitors , um and uh then a very full room when everybody is is here . 
UNKNOWN So I think we're we are quite willing to split and put say maybe one visitor with Maria and David uh fifty per cent in the other room with the second visitor , so that it smooth is . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN But realistically we don't actually have that many visitors coming in . 
UNKNOWN I've been here for almost two years , and we've had a couple of stagieurs , but that's it . 
UNKNOWN Well , yeah , exactly so the visitors are uh basically stagieur and it happens that sometimes we have two of them even if it's only for three or four month . 
UNKNOWN Martin seemed to insist that when we have a visiting professor , for instance , we cannot really put him with Gisella , because , well they wouldn't feel very nice , they they made a joke about that . 
UNKNOWN No , for a professor , yeah , but Oh , in a way , if that's your argumentation , then put a visiting person with a senior researcher , at least , if not a professor , rather than two students . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN So we should manage some kind of decent space . 
UNKNOWN It's true that these one or two last one or two years we didn't have uh a visiting professor . 
UNKNOWN But um Yeah , so uh I think , yeah , these are the three main points . 
UNKNOWN So one is the place of the lounge . 
UNKNOWN Uh , the other one is the uh the place of the admin office with Gisella . 
UNKNOWN And the third one is the number of visitor visiting people and uh , well , how many of them we want to accommodate and where where we put it . 
UNKNOWN These , I think , are the three main differences . 
UNKNOWN Otherwise , we pretty much agree on uh on placing people . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um sorry ? 
UNKNOWN I I didn't understand . 
UNKNOWN If you're gonna argue that the visitors are supposed to be important and they should have their own space , then put them with another researcher , rather than two students . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's that's true , I think , yeah , they are are quite open to to this . 
UNKNOWN Martin also reminded us that he is quite noisy . 
UNKNOWN He has a lot of uh phone calls to make , even if it's here if he's here only fifty per cent of the time . 
UNKNOWN Um , so yeah , I I I don't mind this , but uh that's something But it's true , yeah , we could also try to put a visitor and the professor . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um , Martin made another point . 
UNKNOWN It was the fact that sometimes professor have to professors have to discuss sensitive matters about projects and financing , and they sometimes might feel uncomfortable discussing this with their well , in the presence of their P_H_D_ students . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Like saying , oh I I have to reduce her t from eighty per cent to fifty per cent . 
UNKNOWN That's probably something So I I mean , all these are constraints . 
UNKNOWN Uh-uh . 
UNKNOWN I don't know how how you would like us to proceed from from here , or if you already have questions or reactions on this one . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN But how often the lounge is used , um People uses on regular basis daily basis or Oh . 
UNKNOWN Fairly regularly there's at least one or two people in there . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN In the lounge , yeah . 
UNKNOWN I mean it's a Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It's a fairly new thing in the department , but it's being used pretty regularly or something that a lot of people wanted , just sort of quiet space out of your office that doesn't have the office furniture , the office chairs , it sort of has comfortable sofas and armchairs and things like that , where you can just go and relax , and or if you wanna read something for a longer period of time in a more comfortable environment . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN And because we do a lot of reading and things like that , it does get used fairly often . 
UNKNOWN So it's not a place for discussion . 
UNKNOWN And it's it's it's a quiet place . 
UNKNOWN We sort of have an open policy where if there's no one in there and you want to have a discussion , then that's fine , but you can't displace people who are in there reading , just because you want to have a mini-meeting or whatever . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Mm I see . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN And so i there's no are you planning some kind of partition between the lounge and the offices or ar How are you gonna keep those things I think should ask the question to you , how are you gonna keep them separate ? 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah um Well Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause it seems like fairly separate functions . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , we Yeah , that's true , that's one of the problems . 
UNKNOWN Um , well we were told that it was not really possible to build walls , but we noticed that this room actually has two doors . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So uh we thought that maybe we could put some kind of , well , separation . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Book-cases or something or Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I Yeah , maybe just , yeah , furniture or just uh some kind of screen . 
UNKNOWN Mm yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN But it won't be uh an acoustic separation ? 
UNKNOWN No , it's not sound-proof . 
UNKNOWN So if if the Those are students there ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , they're Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So if they're noisy , that could disrupt the quiet of the lounge . 
UNKNOWN Um , but As a separate room . 
UNKNOWN Which is sort of why in our proposal we had it completely as a separate room . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So if you really want peace and quiet , you shut the door and when the doors are shut , like unless someone's making noise right outside the door , it really is fairly quiet . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But you've also put the lounge in a a very k kind of a high-traffic area where the mailboxes are , the printer and the restrooms . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So that's um That may also tha that may be good for meeting people and bumping into people , but it's maybe against the idea if it's a very supposed to be an isolated quiet spot . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So I d mm , you know Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , well , it was actually this pressure from from my group that led to this , to squeeze a little bit uh the place of the lounge . 
UNKNOWN Now , how for instance would the university feel about a room that would be only used as a lounge ? 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Would they feel it's too empty and that we have too much space ? 
UNKNOWN Or w is there no problem ? 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN The Do do you see a problem with having a l a room just for a lounge or no ? 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Well , maybe if it if it helps us pack more people into the offices , because they have a private lounge . 
UNKNOWN maybe it's a good thing . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Saves us money . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN But uh Uh yeah , I guess that's Let's see , what is that ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So we could have a separate room as a lounge as long as uh we pack the other offices . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Personally I I have no problem with this . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN So um that's that's fine . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN I mean , suppose if the need really arises and it comes to a point where we do have a lot of people , then you can get rid of the lounge , figure out what to do with the furniture , either distribute it between various offices or put it into storage somewhere . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Mm yeah . 
UNKNOWN But you're saying it does get used . 
UNKNOWN So you've it's it's not a completely experimental concept . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Your your department has a lounge and it gets used a lot . 
UNKNOWN No no no . 
UNKNOWN No , this is something that it started off sort of as a discussion at the coffee table , where people were complaining that sort of in the middle of the afternoon they just wanted somewhere to go off and no have some quiet time and That's where it came from . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
SURPRISE Oh .
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So you have some Oh . 
UNKNOWN So you have some books also like ? 
UNKNOWN Mm hmm Oh , okay . 
UNKNOWN There are bookshelves in there , but it's not really a library , 'cause everyone At the moment , everyone has a bookshelf in their office and we just go in and borrow books from everyone else . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN It's more really about having a comfortable place to sit um where it's not an office environment , it doesn't look anything like an office . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , you mean you can display some new journals or a new proceedings and Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So it's just Yeah yeah , and people can come w in with their stuff or leave a newspaper or a magazine lying around for other people . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah , exactly . 
UNKNOWN Yeah yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN We've got a bulletin board where you can paste up articles that you think are b interesting for other people , but I d Well she shares an office , so Which is why we were thinking that it wouldn't be a problem to s keep her with a spare person , because that's the w the situation it is right now , and if you're a stagieur and you're coming , and you don't necessarily expect to have a full-blown office , if you are only there for about two months . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so I think maybe we can agree on on the lounge in a separate room if we can manage to to find space elsewhere . 
UNKNOWN What about Gisella , how do you feel about putting her in a separate office ? 
UNKNOWN Which is the case now I think . 
UNKNOWN Well she has an extra Yeah . 
UNKNOWN With a visitor space , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , it depends on what kind of visitor you are exactly . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So we could say some kind of low key visitor . 
UNKNOWN This is uh very nice . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN You mean these fifty per cents , I mean , they're all separate or Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Actually , Gisella fifty per cent means that she's there half time , uh generally in the mornings . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Gisella has a fixed schedule for when she's there , but David and Martin are sort of they f it fluctuates . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Like they can't say that they'll be there Monday , Tuesday and half of Wednesday , and not the rest of the time , which is part of the problem . 
UNKNOWN I mean , they don't Okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah okay . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN I mean , they can't s specify when exactly they'll be there . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So our rationale for putting them in a three person room is is that it doesn't matter when they're there and whether they're there for certain hours or not . 
UNKNOWN It's just either there's two or three people in those rooms , and sometimes there's less , sometimes there's more , because we also don't work fixed hours . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN It's not like we work , you know , nine to five or whatever . 
UNKNOWN Everyone sort of keeps their own hours . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So , can you just summarize briefly the differences between your two proposals , the key differences ? 
UNKNOWN Um , I think it's what I tried to to do before , it's the shared lounge , uh th Um Do you have assistants with professors ? 
UNKNOWN Uh sh shared Yeah , the shared lounge , the the assistants with their professors . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN In two cases . 
UNKNOWN Yeah ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And then secretary has separate room . 
UNKNOWN We have Pierrette and Marianne in the same Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN No , I think this is quite accepted and it's a bit the case . 
UNKNOWN Oh okay . 
UNKNOWN So that's okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , okay 'cause Yeah , okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN No , I think it's uh the lounge uh the admin room An Yeah , and the number of slots for visitors and for this new student who arrives , because having just one spare place , this was probably the strongest disagreement in my group . 
UNKNOWN So Yeah . 
UNKNOWN T_V_ at The lounge , the admin room separate . 
UNKNOWN Not shared . 
UNKNOWN For visitors . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN People said uh we should have at least two or three spare places , just for , you know , growing or sometimes you have three interns that arrive . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So even if they are not perfect places . 
UNKNOWN Um Yeah , that's yeah , that's how we did in in our proposal , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so you basically achieve that by giving less space to the reading room , I think . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Uh . 
UNKNOWN So I guess what One of the questions is how important is the reading room to your group really ? 
UNKNOWN Is it is it something that's a very valued thing that has to be protected , um , or is it okay to l make it be kind of this spare space that gets used up a little bit when you need when you have some extra visitors or things like that . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think that's Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN I think , because it's a fairly new thing , it's a little hard to say at this point . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think that most people like it , now that it's there , they sort of see the value of it and they wouldn't want to see it wiped out entirely , definitely . 
UNKNOWN Mm yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN But I suppose once it if it gets eaten away a little bit , at one some point it becomes unuseful , and then Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So it Mm yeah . 
UNKNOWN And that's the danger is Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN But then we need to squeeze in in one of the three person rooms some extra visitor space and uh I I think so . 
UNKNOWN N d Hmm . 
UNKNOWN If if we want to keep the reading room . 
UNKNOWN Uh I think it's possible by playing a little bit with the furniture . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um , so yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think another point here , and I don't know how you you feel about it , is , well , the fact that Martin is said he would be quite noisy fifty per cent of the time . 
UNKNOWN So many phone calls . 
UNKNOWN So I wouldn't put him in that big office , even if he's fifty per cent , but he's still a professor here and we got him from E_P_F_L_ . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Mm 'kay . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So that I I think I mean if we need to reach a solution now , I I wouldn't mind working from your plan , and doing some changes . 
UNKNOWN Or if you prefer working from mine and doing other changes . 
CONFIRMATION Sure . 
UNKNOWN Either way . 
UNKNOWN So um Okay , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay well , since this one's up , keep this one in . 
UNKNOWN Depends how how easy you can write in it . 
UNKNOWN Easily , go ahead . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so let's keep the reading room . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Uh also I think Pierrette Pierrette and Martin p should deserve at least I think offices with one person , not with two . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Double rooms . 
UNKNOWN Mm 'kay . 
UNKNOWN Uh Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Maybe can you combine both , or like in two person room , Pierrette too ? 
UNKNOWN Pierrette and Martin ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , Martin is fifty per cent . 
UNKNOWN We we never asked them , it could be , but um on the other side they have , I think , no real project in common , so I wonder Whe I I think I would prefer , and probably my group would prefer , to see them with the respective assistants , and I think Pierrette plus Marianne is a very good combination . 
UNKNOWN Maybe Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Why not switching them from , yeah , that office ? 
UNKNOWN Here ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , switch the whole group . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , Marianne Swedish , and then Pierrette . 
UNKNOWN Out There's two Mariannes , one is Swedish , one is Finnish . 
UNKNOWN So what does that mean , Swedish um Oh , I see . 
UNKNOWN Because there are two Mariannes . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN One is finishing . 
UNKNOWN So we just call them the Swedish and the Finnish . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN And both family names start with S_ T_ A_ . 
UNKNOWN Oops . 
SURPRISE Oh .
SURPRISE Oh .
NEGATION No . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN No , not true . 
UNKNOWN No , both start with S_ but Uh , it was Bruno , right ? 
UNKNOWN The just S_ . 
UNKNOWN Just S_ , uh so just to know who they are , okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Mm 'kay . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Now let's do something with Martin too . 
UNKNOWN Um Yeah , maybe we can write it down , say vis vis one . 
UNKNOWN But then you can create on more spared place in that big three piece room , no Yeah , somewhere . 
UNKNOWN In here ? 
UNKNOWN fifty per cent . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN David is fifty per cent and visitor one should Yeah , or spare or It's fine . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Well for m Martin If you didn't mind working with Martin , we can switch Nancy and Martin here . 
UNKNOWN Gisella Yeah , mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN I think that's closer to what I said . 
UNKNOWN Oops . 
UNKNOWN Well , because actually we have this project in common . 
UNKNOWN You know , call I_M_ two . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Ah . 
UNKNOWN Wrong keyboard . 
UNKNOWN I've heard of that . 
UNKNOWN Um yeah , I think it's And so d could we um Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So we can say that this is sort of for But then again you get the more formal visitor in with a bunch of students in a crowded room . 
UNKNOWN Well , I think , yeah , always Gisella , but I think there is no way to uh Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Well , you can say that this one is for let's say stagieurs or interns . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , sort of second uh Um , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah yeah yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But then you can move administration to the single room . 
UNKNOWN The k Because she's only fifty per cent working and and she will Oh yeah . 
UNKNOWN So you would put Gisella in a one person room ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , and give that room to f some professor with a student or from for visitor with the visiting place or Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , we could , yeah , even put We couldn't put Maggie and Bruno together . 
UNKNOWN Well you can move Maggie and Bruno into this room . 
UNKNOWN That's obviously the case . 
UNKNOWN Move Gisella , move the other spare place to the big room , but then there's not a lot of people in there . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN No , let's leave it like this for the moment . 
UNKNOWN How do you feel , because your office well , three persons and you are all full time in there , so you with Nancy and Maria ? 
UNKNOWN We're not terribly noisy , I think it'll be fine . 
UNKNOWN Uh-huh . 
UNKNOWN Yeah and you have Parmenides in common with Nancy . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And I am too in common with Maria . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN And we work on slightly different schedules too , 'cause Maria and I tend to work earlier and Nancy tends to work later . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So that shouldn't be a problem . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN And do you think we could put a visitor with Nikos and Yalina ? 
UNKNOWN Because it's it's also it's not very clear , you know , Yalina's that we said in our meeting . 
UNKNOWN Yalina's master thesis should be defended in a couple of months or something like that . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So we don't really know what happens afterwards . 
UNKNOWN So we could at least think it's sort of an open place . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Or we could get that office for you and Nancy and put Nikos and uh Yalina with Maria and a visitor ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN What about that ? 
UNKNOWN Wouldn't you like to have a calmer spot ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Sure . 
UNKNOWN Um , so you want to do That's gonna back-fire on me . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN So when you when you put four people in that office , does that mean you're planning on four desks ? 
UNKNOWN You need space for four desks ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And that's the problem is that you either get smaller desks , 'cause the ones that we have now won't fit . 
UNKNOWN Do you know if it's possible . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but a visitor actually uh doesn't have that much paper, so for instance maybe they don't need uh , well uh the place to put their files , you know , a smaller drawer . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Mm right . 
UNKNOWN They just need a a desk and probably just one drawer under underneath . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN And so you can fit that , you think . 
UNKNOWN But you can't put three desks in the two person rooms . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , probably not . 
UNKNOWN I think it wouldn't be uh Yalina and maybe we could think of a visitor too here ? 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So that Think so ? 
UNKNOWN I think it's gonna be too much . 
UNKNOWN Well , Maria is full-time . 
UNKNOWN Because remember there is also this Paola arriving um on the new project . 
UNKNOWN So , you know , Susan insisted that uh we should be And it it's al also it's not very clear because Nikos and Yalina are Well , Nikos is um research student , Yalina will finish her master thesis , so it's Yeah , okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , Paola or Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So just like that ? 
UNKNOWN Or maybe Paola will be able to choose . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I think that's quite okay . 
UNKNOWN I don't know about any preference of Maggie being alone or with Bruno , or no ? 
UNKNOWN No ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN I don't think she cares . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Um , David mentioned also that there should be some kind of gender balance . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh I don't know if there is a strong constraint , but I think we are doing pretty well . 
UNKNOWN You mean Maybe you should break the wall between the men's room and the women's room . 
UNKNOWN Well , so I'm not sure that was what was meant , but Ha . 
UNKNOWN Sorry . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN Actu Bruno did mention that he didn't want to be in a room with a lot of people , 'cause he did that before and he didn't really like it . 
UNKNOWN So maybe I don't know , I can switch with him , and we can put him and Nancy together . 
UNKNOWN Oh mm . 
UNKNOWN I don't mind , it doesn't really bother me . 
UNKNOWN Okay , that's fine if he mentioned this to you , that's quite nice . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN And okay , yeah , I'm with Martin . 
UNKNOWN Not very balanced . 
UNKNOWN Well , the gender balancing , we have more women than men in our department anyways so No . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's why Okay , if you don't mind me sharing the office with Martin , that's fine . 
UNKNOWN Okay , yeah , that looks good . 
UNKNOWN So Agnes with Marianne and David . 
UNKNOWN Okay ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , so you have I_M_ two in common . 
UNKNOWN That's nice and he is fifty per cent , so that means the office is not very crowded . 
UNKNOWN Okay , the other one is a bit crowded , but that's okay . 
UNKNOWN Do you see any constraints from any administrative sides ? 
UNKNOWN Gisel Mm-hmm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN But even like you can put mm Paola in administrate office like You're already three people . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Mm , it looks like small room compared to the other three p Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Is your person to square meter ratio within the n university norms ? 
UNKNOWN Um I I think for the moment . 
UNKNOWN Good question . 
UNKNOWN Overall . 
UNKNOWN We don't we don't , I mean , we don't want people coming in seeing this lavish reading room and and and everyone having their own office if that's not what we are having in the other places . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN K Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN We have to make sure that um if for example there's a spare reading room , like we were saying before . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Overall your department has doesn't have excessive space per person . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Well , what was said in in my group , actually Susan who knows professors from other um other faculties , well , she noticed that most of them have rooms alone . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So this is true for Susan and Maggie , but not true here for Pierrette and and and Martin . 
UNKNOWN So we can already argue that uh we're squeezing in even the the professors . 
UNKNOWN It's true that the reading room But you know we fought so much to have it , so let's uh let's try to have it there . 
UNKNOWN And I think putting four people in a three person room is already a sign that uh we are already quite uh quite full , so um I think , yeah , it's normally the nominal capacity of this , I think , it's uh eighteen people . 
UNKNOWN Mm right . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um , eighteen or or seventeen . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN And we're only fifteen if you don't count Paola and some visitor's place . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN And I think it's quite important to have space for visitors , because if you have no visitors or if you cannot take a new , well , intern , during the summer , you're very much handicapped . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So I think we're , yeah , on Well , the reaction of my group was that this was almost full already , so I well , we tried to I thin Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So basically , we're moving into a new space , but it's only marginally better than the old one . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Mm yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , so I think , yeah , what we could say about the reading room is that we we squeeze quite a lot of people in in the other offices , so I think it's okay . 
UNKNOWN Mm bu Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
UNKNOWN Well , it's good in case I ever have to defend it . 
UNKNOWN Um Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN You know , it's good to have some numbers , if you can come up with some numbers uh Some And maybe uh relative to some other comparable departments . 
UNKNOWN Mm sure , yeah , we can do that . 
UNKNOWN That's It's it's good to have that . 
UNKNOWN Mm 'kay . 
UNKNOWN But if you both agree with this plan and you think your group will be happy , then uh fine with me . 
CONFIRMATION Sure . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I don't know about you , what do you think ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , it's fine . 
UNKNOWN Yeah ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So I'll save that . 
UNKNOWN Perfect , just save it please . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Maybe it's another name . 
UNKNOWN Just say okay , it's fine . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So , my group also asked to circulate the final proposal just to make sure there is no major problem . 
UNKNOWN The final copy. 
UNKNOWN I'll circulate it to everyone , along with the numbers that you guys wanted to see in terms of the space . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN And the numbers . 
UNKNOWN Okay ? 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN And we're done . 
UNKNOWN Great , thank you for your time . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
UNKNOWN Well , thank you . 
THANKS Thank you . 
UNKNOWN No problem . 
THANKS Thank you , sirs . 
THANKS Thank you . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN It's just that I need uh some some white paper. 
UNKNOWN 
UNKNOWN 
UNKNOWN *** AQUI AQUI ****
UNKNOWN *** AQUI AQUI ****
UNKNOWN *** AQUI AQUI ****
UNKNOWN 
UNKNOWN 
UNKNOWN 
UNKNOWN Are you gonna take the minutes? 
UNKNOWN Uh yes . 
UNKNOWN Good . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN Um So hello everybody . 
GREETING Hello . 
UNKNOWN So uh you everybody had the a agendafor today , you received it or Yep . 
GREETING Hello . 
UNKNOWN Um , hello ? 
UNKNOWN Um I don't , do you have an extra copy? 
CONFIRMATION Thanks . 
UNKNOWN So the goal for today is to decide for a movie to project at the end of the month , so for this month of of April , and also discuss the content for an adver advertising postersand um I I will present you three des different design , we'll discuss it . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So first we have to decide for um a movie . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So I think we all prepared documents. 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Yes , I did . 
UNKNOWN So I propose that we start with uh presentationAgnes uh sent . 
CONFIRMATION Sure . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so the previous movies that we've done this year were Lawrence of Arabia , Apop Apocalypse Now and Amadeus , which were all historical , serious , dramatic and somewhat actiony movies . 
UNKNOWN So for this month I propose doing something different , preferably something set in the present , um something maybe dramatic but slightly less serious . 
UNKNOWN So what I'd propose is actually a thriller or a mystery . 
UNKNOWN And while these days people are so jaded by general movies that they tend not to be surprised by the endings in mysteries , some movies in the nineties did actually have twists that people came out saying , never saw that coming , I didn't know that that was gonna happen . 
UNKNOWN And so what I'm gonna do is present you two of those movies , and before anyone says that , well , if you know th how the movie ends , you're not gonna wanna see it again , that's not necessarily the case , because a lot of people like to re-watch movies um to see where the clues were , what they missed , things they didn't pay attention to the first time around . 
UNKNOWN Um so if you can go to the next slide. 
UNKNOWN What I'd propose is either The Usual Suspects or The Sixth Sense . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Um The Usual Suspects is slightly less mainstream . 
UNKNOWN Um is has a fairly large cast , notably Kevin Spacey , Gabriel Byrne , um and it was directed by Bryan Singer , it's one of his earlier movies I think . 
UNKNOWN It was written by Quist Christopher McQuarrie . 
UNKNOWN Um and according to Rolling Stone it's the freshest , funniest and scariest crime thril thriller to come along since Pulp Fiction . 
UNKNOWN Uh The Sixth Sense on the other hand is a more commercial movie with its famous line , I see dead people . 
UNKNOWN Ah . 
UNKNOWN Um it was written and directed by M_ Night uh Shyamalan and stars Bruce Willis , Haley Joel Osment and Toni Collette , and it's about a little boy who sees dead people and i he sees a child psychologist to try to get him to understand why he sees the dead people , what it means . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN And actually the psychologist is dead . 
UNKNOWN Now that you've given away the twist , yes . 
UNKNOWN No , but we're the clubbers , but Agnes , uh I was just wondering , uh I see uh I have here Denis's table , and when they say that it's the freshest whatever since Pulp Fiction , well that's probably not a very long time , because Pulp Fiction is ninety four and Usual Suspects is ninety five . 
UNKNOWN Um Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Send your complaints to Rolling Stone . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So on the next couple of slidesI'll just go through some of um more detailed stuff that we might need for administrative purposes . 
UNKNOWN Um the length for The Usual Suspects um is a hundred and five minutes . 
UNKNOWN Uh as you can s well , as Andrei already said , it's n nineteen ninety five . 
UNKNOWN It has an R_ rating , which means that at least in the in North America it was not recommended for people under eighteen , 'cause it's fairly violent , but not so violent as other movies . 
UNKNOWN Um plot outline uh five villains in New York are rounded up by the police in an unconventional manner that worries them . 
UNKNOWN After release they get together for a spot of revenge , but someone else is controlling events . 
UNKNOWN And the big mystery of the movie is who's controlling the events . 
UNKNOWN Um it got an eight point seven out of ten user rating on the Internet Movie Database , it's sixteenth in the top two hundred and fifty movies of all time , forth in Denis's list of the top movies of the nineteen nineties , which I think was also taken from I_M_D_B_ . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um it won several Academy Awards , including best supporting actor and best writing , um best film for the British equivalent of the Academy Awards , it was nominated for a Cesar for best foreign film . 
UNKNOWN So it got a fair bit of recognition despite not being um a very mainstream , high budget movie , or maybe because it wasn't a mainstream , high budget movie . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So wha what will be your argument for projecting this movie ? 
UNKNOWN I don't think a lot of people have seen it , in fact , other than you haven't seen it , you haven't seen it , you've seen it . 
UNKNOWN I haven't see it . 
UNKNOWN I haven't seen it . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN And don't think a lot of people have seen it , it's not a very very well known movie . 
UNKNOWN What ? 
UNKNOWN It's very well known . 
UNKNOWN Is it ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN it's a One hundred thousand . 
UNKNOWN Really ? 
UNKNOWN I think , yeah . 
UNKNOWN See ? 
UNKNOWN It's one of the most well known thriller . 
UNKNOWN . 
UNKNOWN Really ? 
UNKNOWN That surprises me , I always got the impression that it was Yeah . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN It's it's hard to tell . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So that's your impression . 
UNKNOWN That's my impression , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN That's mine , but uh Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But it's it's rated four fourth in uh in the list and one hundred one hundred thousand seen it . 
UNKNOWN Well , it's a good movie . 
UNKNOWN How many people voted for it , yeah ? 
UNKNOWN That's true . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN One hundred and two . 
UNKNOWN Voted for it . 
UNKNOWN For for voted for it , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Voted for it , and I think only two other mov uh no , f three other movies uh have uh have more votes . 
UNKNOWN More votes ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , it's it seems to be quite popular . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So but I think the main thing is it's got a good twist at the end and it's it's an interesting movie to watch . 
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um so if you go to the next slide. 
UNKNOWN More or less the same thing for The Sixth Sense . 
UNKNOWN It's slightly newer , nineteen ninety nine , more or less the same amount of time . 
UNKNOWN It has a lower rating , 'cause it's less violent , but it depends what audience we are gonna have at the showings . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Isn't violent at all in fact , or it's more like scary or Uh-huh . 
UNKNOWN It has it's scary and I think it has some sort of slight violence , but . 
UNKNOWN But the kid is seeing dead people , I mean is uh it's quite uh No , but it's quite uh morbid you can say that ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but they're not violently dead . 
UNKNOWN Scary or yeah , mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN It's it's morbid and it's creepy , but it's not violent as in people being sliced in half or anything like that . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , morbid . 
UNKNOWN Creepy or Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um um it's nineteenth in the top movies of the nineties , hundred first in the top two hundred fifty , it was nominated for a lot of awards , it didn't win as many . 
UNKNOWN Might have won more sort of minor awards , but at least the Academy Awards , it was nominated for five of them , um but didn't win . 
UNKNOWN Nevertheless still a good movie , still a good twist at the end , which Denis already gave away . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN They don't remember . 
UNKNOWN Good . 
UNKNOWN Um so those would be my two choices . 
UNKNOWN Have you seen it ? 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So what was you criteria for selecting this movie or But then it's only at the at the end that it it becomes a good movie . 
UNKNOWN Let it's a sort of different style from the other movies we've seen , and they have a twist , so it's not your general movie where you just kind of sit through it and go , oh okay , get up and leave . 
UNKNOWN It's at least out of those two movies I came out thinking , oh cool , okay . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but I mean that's a good thing , right ? 
UNKNOWN Only because of the of the end . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN I I've heard some people in the in the theatre saying , oh now we have to see it again . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Ah . 
UNKNOWN Which is a good marketing ploy , if you think about it . 
UNKNOWN But then if you asked them five minutes ago okay . 
UNKNOWN If we show it twice . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So is Bruce Willis the child psychologist ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , Bruce Willis is and the kid is really good , who plays the the main character . 
UNKNOWN Ah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Great . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It's the guy who then played in uh Artificial Intelligence or something like this , mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Great . 
UNKNOWN Same guy . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so uh I think , Mirek , you prepared a presentationalso . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN We can have a look . 
UNKNOWN So my presentationis not that detailed , I just uh put there seven uh highly uh ranked movies , and we can just try to g uh go very quickly through all of them , just to re remind you them , and then we can perhaps consider another p uh potential candidates . 
UNKNOWN Sorry , it's control L_ I have s I have seen it , but I don't remember it . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so the movies that I have selected as as very good uh good ranked movies uh are uh uh are on the screen so uh Shaw The Shawshank Redemption , Schindler's List , Usual Suspects , Pulp Fiction , Goodfellas , Silence of the Lambs and American Beauty . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Uh so perhaps we can go to the to the f to the first movie . 
UNKNOWN Uh The Shawshank Redempt uh Redemption um actually I didn't see that movie , so is there someone else who have seen this movie ? 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN Uh me neither . 
UNKNOWN I've heard a lot of really good things about it , but Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN I thi So uh I was told that in French it was called uh Les Evadees . 
UNKNOWN Which is not good . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Okay , the plot outline says that the life of Andy uh Dufresne Duf okay , of Andy , changes when he uh he's uh convicted and jailed for the murder of his wife , and the user comment says it's simply amazing , the best uh film of the nineties . 
UNKNOWN . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So that's uh what it says , okay , we can't tell much more , because basically none of us have seen it . 
UNKNOWN Should we should we believe this ? 
UNKNOWN But the rating is very good then . 
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm , yeah . 
UNKNOWN So the second one is a Schindler's list , it's more serious movie , it's from the St uh Steven Spielberg and it's about the Second War uh Sec Second World War . 
UNKNOWN Uh the plot outline is that the Oskar Schindler uh uses Jews to uh start a factory in Poland during the war , and he witnesses the uh horrors uh endured by the Jews and starts to save them . 
UNKNOWN User comment says , a film for all to see and learn , and I think it's really something what is very serious uh theme and uh yeah . 
UNKNOWN So that's a Schindler's List , um we can perhaps do you have some comments ? 
UNKNOWN I I have seen it . 
UNKNOWN I think it's really good movie , it's uh it's quite long actually , I can't uh here I didn't put the the minutes, but I think it's it's at least about three hours . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I think it's about three hours long , something like that . 
UNKNOWN And it's a heavy movie , I it's emotional , it's I think it did . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It you know if it's to uh if it received some award ? 
UNKNOWN No , I don't know , I don't know , unfortunately . 
UNKNOWN Or Probably no ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I think also but uh Yeah yeah . 
UNKNOWN Either for director if not for best picture . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , maybe even best picture , yeah . 
UNKNOWN But I would expect it . 
UNKNOWN I would expect it . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so if you can go to the It's a true story , yeah . 
UNKNOWN But yeah , indeed , it's maybe too sad and too , yeah , too poignant for Well Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Well , it's a true story also , uh so . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It's it's yeah , I would say that the user comment says everything , a film to see and to learn . 
UNKNOWN And to remember maybe , or Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And to remember as well , yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Okay , th so the third one is The Usual Suspects . 
UNKNOWN So I think I I wouldn't uh I don't want to comment it again , so we can just skip that , because it was this this is the one already commented by Agnes . 
UNKNOWN So let's go to the to the other one . 
UNKNOWN Pulp Fiction . 
UNKNOWN I would say that's that's like a classical movies of of nineties , uh it's uh directed by Quentin Tarantino , it's a it's a crime and drama , it's a a there i there are several s several stories that are just mixed up during the during the movie , and uh yeah , it's a real classical movie , I would say almost nowadays . 
UNKNOWN . 
UNKNOWN So I've seen it . 
UNKNOWN So who has seen it ? 
UNKNOWN Agnes , you've seen it ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I've seen it . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I've seen it too . 
UNKNOWN Yeah it's it's very good and it's a bit violent , but it's also quite funny I think . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So all of us . 
UNKNOWN Sure , sure , you can see it several times , because I mean the first time you cannot catch all the details , and then i when you see it second times and third times it's It's big comeback , yeah , big comeback of John Travolta , yes . 
UNKNOWN It's a Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN And it's it's the comeback from of uh John Travolta , no ? 
UNKNOWN So uh Big comeback , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah , that was his comeback movie , yeah . 
UNKNOWN I would say good comeback . 
UNKNOWN Bruce Willis is there also . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Who is there ? 
UNKNOWN Huh . 
UNKNOWN the boxer . 
UNKNOWN Um Sorry ? 
UNKNOWN Pardon ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah , yeah , Bruce Willis is there as a boxer , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , as the boxer . 
UNKNOWN And what's the name of the girl on the poster. 
UNKNOWN Um Yes . 
UNKNOWN Um Uma Thurman , okay . 
UNKNOWN It's Uma Thurman , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh Uma Thurman . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so that's Pulp Fiction , definitely should be considered uh . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN So on the list I I brought on the docu on my document, the two movies , Pulp Fiction and Usual Su Suspect are just swapped . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Pulp Fiction is actually coming before The Usual Suspect . 
UNKNOWN Wow , that's interesting . 
UNKNOWN How . 
UNKNOWN Uh maybe 'cause I_M_D_B_ is updated daily , so if it happens that people had voted for it Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN That may be . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , because yeah because I have I have uh I have th this review on on Wednesday . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , Tuesday , it's quite surprising though , but uh , okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , it's strange , with so many votes that they can p shift . 
UNKNOWN It's Goodfellas , I haven't see that movie . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I mean statistically speaking it's strange . 
UNKNOWN The plot outline says that the Henry Hill and the his friends uh work their way uh their way up through the mob uh hierarchy , and uh the user comment says , it's a simply a masterpiece , so and if you go to the to the to the votes , there is quite a lot of people who has vote for the Goodfellas , sixty six thousand . 
UNKNOWN Okay , it's It's modern day average , so it's perhaps not a bad movie . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Wow . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN I dunno , I haven't see that . 
UNKNOWN Actually I have seen it , now I realise , yeah , yeah . 
UNKNOWN You have seen it ? 
UNKNOWN Have you ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah ? 
UNKNOWN No , because I thought it was like another movie , but it's it's this movie actually . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN But it is this movie . 
UNKNOWN But it was that movie ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN uh-huh . 
UNKNOWN Ah okay . 
UNKNOWN And how i was it called , Mafia ? 
UNKNOWN Uh Les in French . 
UNKNOWN I think it that one , but it's very violent . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm mm-hmm mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Very . 
UNKNOWN It doesn't say it here , but uh it's probably rated R_ . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I wouldn't be surprised . 
UNKNOWN So it talks about the nineteen twen twenties or something like o of twenties ? 
UNKNOWN No , it's later than that , isn't it ? 
UNKNOWN It speak about uh a guy who is not Italian , who is uh going up in the hierarchy of mafia . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so . 
UNKNOWN So . 
UNKNOWN Not really in favour of this , but Ah . 
UNKNOWN The mob , so the mob is the mafia actually ? 
UNKNOWN Mob is mafia , mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Silence of the Lambs , that's a godfather of all thrillers , I would say . 
UNKNOWN Fully in line with the user comments . 
UNKNOWN Uh basically it's a it's a thriller , horror and crime all together . 
UNKNOWN The plot outline says that the uh Clarice Starling , the young F_B_I_ agent is assigned to help a f to help find a mi uh missing woman and save her from the ps psychopathic killer with the help of another killer . 
UNKNOWN This another killer is actually in a jail and it's uh Anthony Hopkins , and he really plays it a very good , I would say . 
UNKNOWN I'm not sure whether he received some a awards for that , but it's really it's Yes , very good performance , very good performance . 
UNKNOWN I don't know , but it was a good performance , creepy . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN And Jodie Foster is very good as well . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , and we can see her actually on the picture on the on the projector. 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN She was pretty young , no ? 
UNKNOWN For . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I think , yeah , when yeah , I saw this movie some time ago and yeah , she looked quite young I thought . 
UNKNOWN I think so , yeah . 
UNKNOWN . 
UNKNOWN W w from whe when is the movie ? 
UNKNOWN When did it come out ? 
UNKNOWN Um uh ninety one uh ninety one uh . 
UNKNOWN Ninety one , . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Ninety one , yeah . 
UNKNOWN So nowadays she's already fourteen years older .

CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So that's why It was really disgusting , yeah . 
UNKNOWN But not that good , no ?

UNKNOWN Violent and and uh scary as well . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Psychopathic , I mean it's uh Okay . 
UNKNOWN And last choice . 
UNKNOWN And the last choice that um I think it's it's not a bad movie , it's uh American Beauty . 
UNKNOWN That's a good movie . 
UNKNOWN Uh it's basically about the about the people in America , each of them is uh I would say psychotic in his uh his own way , but uh normally they appear to be uh s normal people , as as we can see them ev every day . 
UNKNOWN Yep , that's a good one . 
UNKNOWN Uh so and it's really it's uh the user comments say it's a deep , wonderful , penetrating uh film , extraordinary uh irony uh in a psychological drama about American life , and I can fully agree with this user comment . 
UNKNOWN Uh He's simulati I I I've seen this movie , but I Yeah , yeah , yeah .

CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh Oh so you recognise the rose . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah , that's true , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Exactly . 
UNKNOWN Uh-huh . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um so what will be your favou your preferred one on in this list ? 
UNKNOWN And I think that's the last If would like to go for something what is really serious I would definitely uh go for Schindler's List , and if not uh then Hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I would like to see this uh Shawshank Redemption , because it receive i yeah , it it none of us seen this movie unfortunately , but uh as you can see from the from your from your table , there is a plenty of votes . 
UNKNOWN The first one , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Probably yeah , you received so yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah . 
UNKNOWN It's actually I think it's a movie with highest number of the votes , yeah , it is . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's true . 
UNKNOWN And it's uh Tim Robbins and uh who is the the guy behi Morgan Freeman . 
UNKNOWN Morgan Freeman . 
UNKNOWN Morgan Freeman , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , great actors . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but didn't I mean I see this name of the the director on the slide, but I don't really know him . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Darabont . 
UNKNOWN Frank Darabont ? 
UNKNOWN Me neither , me neither . 
UNKNOWN Mm yeah . 
UNKNOWN Never heard of this guy . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but really I would like to highlight that it's a it's a movie with highest number of the votes and the highest ranking at the same time . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Yep , it tells something . 
UNKNOWN Okay , it's just a do we want to have to display the most popular movie or or we're Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well let's go through the other suggestions . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I'm not sure . 
UNKNOWN And actually I don't think it's it's it's that popular in Europe at least , because I really you see , none of us have seen it , so . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN That's right , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , maybe . 
UNKNOWN But it's true , yeah , we shouldn't stick to only very highly rated movies on this table . 
UNKNOWN Though it's a very useful table , but um okay , do you want me to yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay , Andrei , yeah , can can you comment your Yeah . 
UNKNOWN oSo yeah , uh I wrote some noteson um on Saving Private Ryan , which is my candidate . 
UNKNOWN If you can display them it's perfect . 
UNKNOWN Uh do you all have a copyof them ? 
UNKNOWN I do . 
UNKNOWN I have some papercopies. 
UNKNOWN Um yeah , I w thank you . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh you're welcome . 
UNKNOWN So actually given that more or less our theme since the beginning of the year was um history , drama , action , and given also that , well , we decided to to present this month a movie from the the nineties , um I thought that among these movies , who look quite popular , uh Saving Private Ryan would be a very good candidate . 
UNKNOWN Um actually it's a movie I've seen . 
UNKNOWN Have you seen it before ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so you've all seen it , so maybe everyone has seen it , I'm not very sure . 
UNKNOWN Um but I think it's a very novel treatment of of war , it's uh it's no longer the b glorification of uh , whatever , combat and victory , but the plot is quite different , it's about saving one person who has a special special value in the in the movie um if only because his brothers actually were all killed , so uh the government believes that they should save at least one person from the family , and saving means actually removing from the the front , if you if re if you remember the plot . 
UNKNOWN So in fact this guy , the Private Ryan is not at all the main actor , the the main a well , the main character is uh played by Tom Hanks and it's actually you can see his picture on the second pageof my my notesuh Captain John Miller . 
UNKNOWN So he is sent with this rather strange mission , which is not a combat mission , but they uh they want just to to get this guy back , which is in fact this guy is I think behind enemy lines or something like this . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So it happens in in Europe , just after the the Normandy landing , and it's very very striking the way they they filmed all the the combat scenes and uh it's it's very dramatic , it's uh it's not , you know , like in the movies from the fifties or the sixties where people just fall and die anonymously , but here they well , you see everything and you see how many people die on that day . 
UNKNOWN And you e And you enjoyed that , the fact the you see clo I To realise how it wa how it was exactly . 
UNKNOWN Up close . 
UNKNOWN It's actually Well it's very strange , you could s ask this for any sad movie , did you enjoy it . 
UNKNOWN Well I didn't really enjoy to see bad things , but uh I think it was satisfying to see that , well , how dramatic things are . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Exactly , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN I it's very moving , I it's true , it's not very it's not very , well , happy . 
UNKNOWN I don't know how it would compare with Apocalypse Now , if it's darker or maybe Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It's very different , I don't think you can compare them . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , it's very different , yeah . 
UNKNOWN So yeah , so I think this would continue a bit our our theme . 
UNKNOWN So the the movie is ranked quite high , if I if I refer back to your table it's number uh , what actually , um fourteen . 
UNKNOWN Quite a lot of votes , so um also one of the the mainstream movies . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um on the second pageuh of my notesI well I quoted some uh well some facts about the movie that I found interesting , we we could use them for either a posteror uh or a presentation. 
UNKNOWN Um especially I enjoyed the story about the the colour saturation . 
UNKNOWN It's true that the movie is not really black and white , uh but uh the colours are grey-ish , dark-ish , it it prov it makes a very moving effect . 
UNKNOWN To make it like uh an historical movie or Yeah , mm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I think also to show the um yeah , I think it's the reference to history and also this dark yeah the mood and uh things are actually well most of the things are quite grey , you know , the uniforms , weapons , things and things like that . 
UNKNOWN Also sets the mood a little bit . 
UNKNOWN Darker and Yeah , but you'd get a different impression if you had bright blue sky and bright sunshine behind it . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Exactly . 
UNKNOWN But if I read your first point in the in this uh trivias , I am just surprised because it says that all the principle actors uh underwent several days of uh cruel army training except for the Man Matt Damon , and the reason was that they wan uh that the that the director wanted that uh the other actors would resent him . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Why this was uh wanted actually ? 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Well I think Matt Damon is the guy who must be saved , if I remember well , and in fact the die Well yeah , the people didn't understand why they should save one person . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , he's private Ryan . 
UNKNOWN And they didn't like it , they didn't like the mission ? 
UNKNOWN Well They're being sent to the front behind enemy lines to retrieve one soldier only because all of his other brothers died . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN So and they are quite resentful , because they I mean they feel they should fight , they shouldn't just go there and uh just get someone and get back . 
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , and it okay . 
UNKNOWN And in fact some of them d get killed for this guy . 
UNKNOWN Most of them get killed , don't they ? 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN Actually most of them , yeah , I think so . 
UNKNOWN Most of them . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So there is actually several people dying because of one single single soldier , mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So Yeah , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It's a very I think some people compare it with uh , whatever , Christian message or I dunno , but um I think it's quite quite universal and it's uh I think it's a modern , very modern Well this uh value of one individual , it looks like a Christian message , you know , the value of one is compared to others I I don't know I th I think I heard this at that point , but maybe I'm just wrong . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN What kind of message ? 
UNKNOWN Sorry , I'm not getting your Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So yeah , I I think it would make a coherent choice . 
UNKNOWN It's probably a bit long and we might want something that is lighter and funnier , but uh if we want to keep this this idea of history and conflict and also to show some some kind of modern treatment of it , it it would make for a good choice . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN But if you see in my notesat the bottom of the first pageI put some other candidate movies . 
UNKNOWN Uh La Vita e Bella is an Italian one , but it's also about history and it happens at t the same period as Schindler's List . 
UNKNOWN And I also quoted Pulp Fiction and Silence of the Lambs , um a bit more remote from the themes , but quite well known movies and enjoyable I would say . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN So do you have any questions about this , or should we just move to the next candidate maybe ? 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN Or or we have you have Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN I have no comments , no no , it's Yeah , but I really appreciate your table , because I found this table really useful . 
UNKNOWN Mm-mm . 
UNKNOWN So actually I don't know if uh y any of you have uh read the documentI prepared on The Big Lebowski . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN It's just below the table , so since we all refer to the table Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN It's below the table , yeah . 
UNKNOWN I wanted Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It's a very nice summary . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah , I wanted to say that uh it's quite open , there are many choices possible . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN But then my proposal is The Big Lebowski from um the two brothers uh Coen , Coen brothers . 
UNKNOWN And it's a actually Joel Co Coen who uh directed the movie . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um the plot is quite hard to to make , but maybe you you read it al already you understood something from the plot or . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I tried to . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN No , I think the summary is i is quite good , and especially I think it uh well mm when you read it you just want to go to see the movie . 
UNKNOWN I am ? 
UNKNOWN I think it looks funny for me . 
UNKNOWN I haven't seen the movie , but uh the summary looks funny . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , it's it's it's a bit like the f in my opinion like um American Beauty , because it's it's a funny movie but uh it critiques a lot the American society . 
UNKNOWN And the the the hero , the the Dude , the mm Big Lebowksi , it's actually his name , is a a kind of non-hero , but he's representative of the of uh a normal uh L_A_ L_A_ guy . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN And uh he has a friend comi veter veteran from Vietnam and uh another friend who is never speaking . 
UNKNOWN And they all are together in a bowling club where they meet and they discuss about uh everything . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN They seems to have no job , I not know , we never seen i them working . 
UNKNOWN So doing nothing , just uh take it easy in the life , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And actually he's uh taking part to a kind of um uh uh s some some killers come to his apartment uh because they think he's someone else , and uh the whole story is about uh he wants to to to get some money out of this story , and he's going to see the other Lebowski to ask him money , because he he because the killers actually uh damage some stuff in his apartment . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Actually , who are the two characters on the the p the poster, on the on the image that Uh-huh . 
UNKNOWN It's uh Jeff Bridges and uh John Goodman . 
UNKNOWN John Goodman , you have probably seen him in in a series ? 
UNKNOWN And w and which one is the Big Lebowski on the picture ? 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN On the right , the guy on the right , Jeff Bridges . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so the guy with the glasses . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN And the one on the left is his friend ? 
UNKNOWN Or is that the other Lebowski ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN He's the one coming uh from from Vietnam . 
UNKNOWN The Vietnam guy . 
CONFIRMATION Oh , okay . 
UNKNOWN Aha , yeah . 
UNKNOWN He's kind of uh he is still equipped for for war . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Okay so uh It's f a movie from the nineties actually , yep . 
UNKNOWN But this movie is is supposed to happen in uh what time , I mean it's uh Which ca From the nineties ? 
UNKNOWN And he's still uh still uh prepared from or or still as he he would come from the Vietnam . 
UNKNOWN Yep , yeah , yeah , that's a problem . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN I'm going to actually I want to show you some postersI prepared for this movie , so we actually can discuss at the same time the posterdesign . 
UNKNOWN There i Mm-hmm mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Well , sort of . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN So on the left you see the main characters of the movie , so the the hero at the top left . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Then it's the guy coming back from Vietnam . 
UNKNOWN Afterward it's uh uh a guy who John Turturro , they are competing with him on a bowling uh contest , and um Julianne Moore and the last one is Buscemi or something like that . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Buscemi , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Buscemi ? 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN He's never speaking in the movie . 
UNKNOWN Really ? 
UNKNOWN Each time he's trying to speak , the other one are are stopping him . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN So it's qu No , he's not on the on the picture , the second Lebowski . 
UNKNOWN And this one is supposed to be the second Lebowski ? 
UNKNOWN Or who Okay , okay . 
UNKNOWN So uh my proposition was to add um the title of course , some information abo about the pricing on the right Uh yeah , but when it will be printed it will be okay , I think . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , you cannot read it very well because Mm . 
UNKNOWN But actually I'm I'm little bit missing th some information about our movie club , I think uh there should be some more information . 
UNKNOWN Ah , you mean Okay , so I prepared a second one where th th th there's there is some information . 
UNKNOWN At the bottom we can see that um , do you know Mondre Montreux English Movie Club ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah I like this , mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Uh I said that people can contact us to to get to the committee and select movies . 
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh-huh . 
UNKNOWN So um . 
UNKNOWN I think it looks too much like a C_D_ cover , though . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , the text on this one is very good . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Oh because it's square . 
UNKNOWN I like the layoutof the first one and the content of this one . 
UNKNOWN Uh-huh . 
UNKNOWN So perhaps we can somehow combine them . 
UNKNOWN But there is a th there is a third one . 
UNKNOWN Um actually I I prefer it because it's more colourful also . 
UNKNOWN It looks like two different postersthough . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I don't like the black one . 
UNKNOWN The f the first posteris I think much uh much too dark . 
UNKNOWN I think there is too many colours , too many colours . 
UNKNOWN No , that's nice . 
UNKNOWN Nowadays , you know , if you see some advertisements on the s yeah , but nowadays if you see some advertisement on the on the street , this is typical typical uh posterI wouldn't wouldn't look at . 
UNKNOWN But it's it can catch the eyes actually but um But then the problem I preferred the first one , because I think it's important to have the plot of movie , e especially for uh a movie people don't n never heard about it . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It's hard to read . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN But uh I don't know . 
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , maybe two or three sentences , because I guess they won't stop in front of the poster. 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN The paragraph I think was a little bit long . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so what do you propose , what should I do for these posters? 
UNKNOWN In terms of content . 
UNKNOWN So layoutof the first one and colours of the third one . 
UNKNOWN I would and content of the second one . 
UNKNOWN Okay , I'll try to do something , but first anyway we have to select a movie . 
UNKNOWN So I'll put all the information and you want me to put the at the bottom , all the information about the committee and the the Montreux Club , okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Exactly . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , like what you have there . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN And then maybe replace the paragraph that you had on the first posterwith either shorter sort of descriptions , not even of the whole plot , but just descriptions of the movie or 'cause I think that paragraph is too long , people don't r generally just stand there and then read the whole thing . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so just to conti to finish with The Big Lebowski , it's um I think those two images are pretty representative , so the on the first on on the top you see the hero with a a cowboy that i introduces the movie , and on the bottom it's uh he is he keeps dreaming in th in this movie , because uh uh the killer's um uh put it d put it or he is drinking too much also , so each time he's uh drinking he's having some dreams , very very weird , but interesting . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Oh okay . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So the woman on the second picture , that's Julianne Moore or oh . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Actually , she wants him to she wants to make kids and she's using the Big Lebowski to have kids with him , but he doesn't know . 
UNKNOWN So maybe he's making strange uh Okay . 
UNKNOWN Ah . 
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Interesting . 
UNKNOWN So it's not really violent or I mean the movie is quite for general audiences . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah , it's very very sweet and it's like a it's like a dream actually . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN How is it actually r ranked , because I cannot see it here in your table . 
UNKNOWN Huh . 
UNKNOWN It's um no , it is on in the table actually . 
UNKNOWN I somehow can't find it . 
UNKNOWN It's um it's coming at the end . 
UNKNOWN It's here , forty eight . 
UNKNOWN Forty eight . 
UNKNOWN Ah , forty eight . 
UNKNOWN But quite a lot of people have seen it actually . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , fifty thousand , mm-mm . 
UNKNOWN Well , at least voted for it . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Voted , yeah . 
UNKNOWN I hope more people have seen it . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but generally you vote when you have seen the movie , no ? 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so uh I think we should decide for a movie now . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So maybe each of us can s can select two movies or Okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , let's nominate first . 
UNKNOWN Let's nominate , okay . 
UNKNOWN And then we vote we choose from the list . 
UNKNOWN So I will take basically two extremes , I will take Schindler's List and I will take uh The Big Lebowski . 
UNKNOWN One of the one of them is really just funny and from the nineties , uh I mean the story is from the nineties , while the second one is about the Second War and is uh serious . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Well I'll nominate the one I proposed , Saving Private Ryan , so history , war , drem drama . 
UNKNOWN And I haven't seen it , but I would like to see it and I think American Beauty . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN If you if you think that our series okay , it's not about America , but uh still Apocalypse well , yeah . 
UNKNOWN It's about countries . 
UNKNOWN So , Agnes , Denis ? 
UNKNOWN Um I'd go for Sixth Sense , just because it's different from all the other ones and maybe Shawshank Redemption , just because we haven't seen it . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So Denis , are you happy with our choices or would you like to add something ? 
UNKNOWN Um no , actually I'm happy with the choices , because I really I would really push uh American Beauty , because I think it's uh it's an easy movie to watch and and still there are a lot of things to think afterward . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN And it's representative of the nineties , I think . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So what if we voted , say , like for first and second choice and then we count ? 
UNKNOWN You can give two points to one and one point to another one ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Would you like this strange way to vote ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay , that's Yeah , but then each of us will will uh but then each of us will vote for uh our nominees , so I would propose to to to vote for s sun uh to to give the points to the to the movies that were not nominated by you . 
UNKNOWN Okay , start , Andrei . 
UNKNOWN Um okay so uh Oh yeah , um well it's uh well if I nominated two and I was the only one , I'll give two points to Saving Private Ryan and one to American Beauty . 
UNKNOWN No I don't want to finish I think I'm going to No . 
UNKNOWN Okay , um Okay . 
UNKNOWN You don't want to finish , Denis . 
UNKNOWN Then you'd better hurry . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , maybe it makes more sense , yeah . 
UNKNOWN So then it's it's more complicated but yeah , okay , let's Mm-hmm , okay . 
UNKNOWN That makes the vote more complicated . 
UNKNOWN Um okay , so I'll give um uh b um okay , two to The Sixth Sense and one to The Big Lebowski . 
UNKNOWN Sixth Sense . 
UNKNOWN Okay , me I put two to American Beauty and uh one to Saving Private Ryan . 
UNKNOWN Okay , um So I'll I'll give two to American Beauty and mm one to The Big Lebowski . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN I note that you didn't nominate a film , so you are sort of freer than us . 
UNKNOWN Seconds . 
UNKNOWN Agnes ? 
UNKNOWN No , Big Lebowski , I nominate . 
UNKNOWN Okay , oh . 
UNKNOWN okay , and I wi I will give one to The Big Lebowski and two to The uh uh Shawshank Redemption . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so it's pretty clear . 
UNKNOWN So now try to sum it up . 
UNKNOWN American Beauty . 
UNKNOWN So do we have something ? 
UNKNOWN American Beauty four , Big Lebowski three . 
UNKNOWN American Beauty . 
UNKNOWN Uh three . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So you have to redo the posters, uh ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's the only thing that's worrying me , but it should be okay . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Well you can keep the format , I mean th you didn't have that many graphics in the first one . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So you select you wanted actually me to select the this design ? 
UNKNOWN That takes a bit more time , but if you c if all of you can send me one image , I can make something on the left . 
UNKNOWN You mean the first poster, yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Select one image from the movie and uh With a different title ? 
UNKNOWN But I would say these images are very nice and they are really representative perhaps . 
UNKNOWN Maybe you can leave those . 
UNKNOWN Yes , but of the wrong movie . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN That's the real twist . 
UNKNOWN No but I'll make something . 
UNKNOWN I'm Yeah , sure , sorry . 
UNKNOWN Sorry . 
UNKNOWN Oh leave Julianne Moore . 
UNKNOWN I was sleepi sleeping for a while . 
UNKNOWN Julianne Moore actually uh She's playing in the no ?

UNKNOWN And perhaps we will have some new members . 
UNKNOWN But then in June , what are we going to do in June , because we cannot make movies from ten two thousand Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um American Beauty , finally . 
UNKNOWN Maybe some kind of movies that spans across periods . 
UNKNOWN Or go back to the fifties . 
UNKNOWN I think there is a Godard with a lot of um quotations from other movies or well let's see when we Let's cross the bridge when we get to it . 
UNKNOWN yeah , maybe . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
THANKS Thank you .

UNKNOWN Okay , and then . 
UNKNOWN So we uh we will wait for Anna , a few minutes . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , s yeah , um . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Yours is well Yeah but the the mic should not Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think you can put anywhere you want , actually . 
UNKNOWN I thin It's not a directional mic , anyway .

UNKNOWN Hold that . 
UNKNOWN Yes and you can put can clip it uh on your Somewhere . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN So , good morning , everyone . 
UNKNOWN Um Welcome at uh at the kick off meeting of our uh latest project . 
UNKNOWN I hope you all have been uh updated about it . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Good . 
UNKNOWN So . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN So w we will try to structure this uh meeting with an a with an agendauh as presented here . 
UNKNOWN Um after the opening we will tr get acquainted to each other . 
UNKNOWN See what our roles are in this project . 
UNKNOWN So , um We have been provided with uh some uh w technical tools to uh to communicate and to well , learn from each other's plans uh as I can say um so w we will also try to uh to get acquainted to this tools so they are also new to me I don't know whether you worked with them before . 
UNKNOWN Um then we will come to the uh to the to the actual project plan . 
UNKNOWN You all know I hope how it's about uh the uh new r remote control we are going going to design . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Total . 
UNKNOWN Uh then we will uh discuss uh , well , how it should be and uh wh what uh what our new product should look lite like . 
UNKNOWN And uh well then uh after some twenty five minutes I hope uh we can end this meeting . 
UNKNOWN So . 
UNKNOWN Um basically this is about a uh a new c remote control . 
UNKNOWN Um We When you design a new product you of uh you of course want it to be original . 
UNKNOWN Be uh we want to be distinguished , mm ? 
UNKNOWN People uh want to uh when they look at the shelf want to think , well that's the product I I need . 
UNKNOWN So it needs to be trendy . 
UNKNOWN I mean trendy is what people want , so then I w they will buy our product . 
UNKNOWN But then , uh , it also should work uh user friendly and uh otherwise people uh uh well it will not be uh be rated very well in consumer uh articles and like that . 
UNKNOWN So , the general outline of uh new project will be we first uh go through a functional design phase . 
UNKNOWN Um You all get uh um certain task uh in this uh in this phase and uh then we will meet again and uh discuss this functional design . 
UNKNOWN And the same holds for the uh ph two phases uh after this , the conceptual design and after that a a more detailed design in which the the final project should get its definite shape . 
UNKNOWN Alright , but first we will do some uh tool training . 
UNKNOWN In all in front of you uh you see uh the uh notebooksand w uh n note blocks and we have here a a a a white-board . 
UNKNOWN Whitebo Yeah , you can start it you know . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN And um well it should work uh I've read it from my uh from some colleague that it should work with some kind of toolbar . 
UNKNOWN I didn't find out yet how it work , but maybe one of you did , so Um Yes . 
UNKNOWN Under documentsin the shared folder . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Do Do we have to say something about that ? 
UNKNOWN I I I'm not fully updated about this shared folder uh . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I guess we'll have a shared folder uh with documentsthat we can share . 
UNKNOWN And uh , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yes well we will then find out ho how it works . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Well , this seems to me , yes , some computer program but I didn't find it yet . 
UNKNOWN So , we'll come to that later . 
UNKNOWN So , uh now we will try out the white-board we have here . 
UNKNOWN So , I would suggest uh Well , yes , um we uh we should try to t to drawon it and then well it should be smart some way . 
UNKNOWN Each of us is going . 
UNKNOWN I I'm not really sure how this works , but Yes , a good idea Mael . 
UNKNOWN Okay , shall I start ? 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think for us it's just like a normal whiteboard , but they'll be recording what we write down . 
UNKNOWN So , i But it's Actually , I think I cannot go with uh Yeah . 
UNKNOWN No they will record through that . 
UNKNOWN There's a sensor over there which is going to record the strokes that you make . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN But for us it's just like a normal whiteboard . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN You you D doesn't it work ? 
UNKNOWN Maybe someo Maybe maybe Anna , maybe you can start . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Then he can maybe find out to get his cord right . 
UNKNOWN I have to draw. 
UNKNOWN So um L Why don't you drawuh your favourite animal on on th on the white-board . 
UNKNOWN M my my favourite animal . 
UNKNOWN Sorry this is all tangled up here . 
UNKNOWN Oh , I see uh Yeah . 
UNKNOWN That's better . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN So drawit . 
UNKNOWN We will try to guess what it is . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN I'm a very bad drawer . 
UNKNOWN Weird . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN You're not gonna be able to guess from my drawing. 
UNKNOWN I'm a bad drawer . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN They're ears , by the way . 
UNKNOWN 's a cat . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN Um close though . 
UNKNOWN Okay so like a pet animal . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Like a cat . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It's like a cat , so I guess it's a cat . 
UNKNOWN No , not a cat though . 
UNKNOWN What is this now ? 
UNKNOWN Ah you forget about it . 
UNKNOWN You're on the knife . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , uh I think it's fine . 
UNKNOWN I just don't want to carry it off . 
UNKNOWN Man , this wires , eh ? 
UNKNOWN We need a wireless microphone . 
UNKNOWN You know ? 
UNKNOWN Pro specially we should next project we should take l like that . 
UNKNOWN So , that's the cat . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So . 
UNKNOWN It's not a cat , it's a dog . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN So . 
UNKNOWN Mael . 
UNKNOWN It's a dog . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN So but that's also kind of cat , isn't it ? 
UNKNOWN Oh the dog doesn't have a tail ? 
UNKNOWN It's got a tail then . 
UNKNOWN B bo both predators . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , sure , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah yeah . 
UNKNOWN I thought so . 
UNKNOWN The dogs have a tail . 
UNKNOWN So , thank you . 
UNKNOWN So do cats . 
UNKNOWN Uh d did you uh work out cord ? 
UNKNOWN And you guessed cats without a tail . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I think I will go without without it , right ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN It'll still not extend , right ? 
UNKNOWN It's not up to that . 
UNKNOWN Okay , there you go . 
UNKNOWN So what favourite characteristics . 
CONFUSION Uh . 
UNKNOWN Dogs are always friendly and loyal and fun . 
UNKNOWN A horse ? 
UNKNOWN It's a horse . 
UNKNOWN This is why you're the designer . 
UNKNOWN And I'm marketing . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN Yes , yes this is Yes definitely a horse . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN Oh very good . 
UNKNOWN So I suppose it Yes . 
UNKNOWN Ah Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Ah I think you can put that . 
UNKNOWN That's it . 
UNKNOWN A blue and black zebra . 
UNKNOWN Can you can meet them in Africa , I think . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
CONFIRMATION Very good . 
UNKNOWN So Ma Matthew ? 
UNKNOWN The very rare blue zebras . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN I'll tell to get it off my Uh ? 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So Maybe I hope you have some space in your uh the horse of uh Mael . 
UNKNOWN You got a lot of room here . 
UNKNOWN You can probably reach . 
UNKNOWN Oh y it's not for that . 
UNKNOWN No ? 
NEGATION No . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So what should I draw? 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN He has already to do cat . 
UNKNOWN I took a dog . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN A mouse ? 
UNKNOWN This looks likes a cat who has been driven over . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And we should sum up its favourite charas characteristics , right ? 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Yes , the moustache . 
UNKNOWN So Uh yeah . 
UNKNOWN That's that's definitely a cat . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN And i Th They like to sleep , that's why you said you they are like this . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It's quite , you know relaxed situation . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Yes , okay . 
UNKNOWN She has the small legs . 
UNKNOWN Th thank you , Matthew . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
THANKS Thank you , Matthew . 
UNKNOWN It's a very big rat . 
UNKNOWN Perfect . 
UNKNOWN Or a very small cat . 
UNKNOWN Oh a rat , okay . 
UNKNOWN Yes , this is certain uh some contribution to our project . 
UNKNOWN And you , A bird . 
UNKNOWN Mm 'kay . 
UNKNOWN Your turn . 
UNKNOWN So . 
UNKNOWN Let's see . 
UNKNOWN Which animal has not been drawn yet . 
UNKNOWN So you've all drawn land animals , so why not drawan animal from the water . 
UNKNOWN Okay , in the water . 
UNKNOWN Ah I don't know what that is . 
UNKNOWN It's a bit It's a bit hard to guess . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN So The cat is going to eat the fish or the rat ? 
UNKNOWN Put it colours . 
UNKNOWN Maybe it would help us . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN With different pen widths . 
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm Oh , it's a shark now . 
UNKNOWN So Oh , yes , why not ? 
UNKNOWN Ah it's a shark , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Good idea . 
UNKNOWN Ah it's a baby shark , it looks to me , you know it's going to eat the cat rather than the cat eating the fish , no ? 
CONFUSION Mm . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN Now it's a swordfish . 
UNKNOWN Why not . 
UNKNOWN You have some in in Australia , right ? 
UNKNOWN A swordfish . 
UNKNOWN Swordfish . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um , maybe . 
UNKNOWN I dunno . 
UNKNOWN I've never seen one , no . 
UNKNOWN Oh well . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I hope it still works . 
UNKNOWN Perfect . 
UNKNOWN So W Well , this uh this tool seemed to work . 
UNKNOWN So I dunno if we need to spend time on that , actually But uh Yeah , exactly , yeah . 
UNKNOWN You should go for the next one it seems to me . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Let's continue to uh to the real stuff . 
UNKNOWN Wow . 
UNKNOWN Um our project uh finance uh thing . 
UNKNOWN Uh when we are and when w you are uh going to design w uh we must keep in mind that the selling price of the product uh will be about twenty five Euros , so when designing a project uh I also look at you uh Mael , keep in mind uh uh uh People uh want to get the feeling this is a twenty five Euro project uh pr um product . 
UNKNOWN Twenty four . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Per remote control , yeah ? 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Per project . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um more interesting for our company of course , p uh profit aim , about fifty million Euro . 
UNKNOWN So we have to sell uh quite a lot of this uh um things . 
UNKNOWN Uh we will try to uh to get at a international market uh so um it will be I think mainly Europe and uh Northern America , maybe some uh Asian countries . 
UNKNOWN Ah yeah , the sale man , four million . 
UNKNOWN Um also important for you all is um the the product uh production cost must be maximal uh twelve uh twelve Euro and fifty cents . 
UNKNOWN So it's half of the selling price , if I am good in mathematics . 
UNKNOWN Yes , of course . 
UNKNOWN Uh um I mean we still have to uh to make a profit , huh ? 
UNKNOWN Of course . 
UNKNOWN They have to sell at least four million to make a profit Ah we have to make we have to sell at least four million to make our own profit . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN You all have to be paid . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Excuse me ? 
UNKNOWN Oh you're g very good in mathematics . 
UNKNOWN Fifty mill Of course it should have a on off button . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN Yes , indeed . 
UNKNOWN Four million . 
UNKNOWN So uh well I think w when we are working on the international market , uh in principle it has enough customers uh so when we have a good product we uh we could uh meet this this aim , I think . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So , that about finance . 
UNKNOWN And uh now just let have some discussion about what is a good remote control and uh well keep in mind this this first point , it has to be original , it has to be trendy , it has to be user friendly . 
UNKNOWN Um , maybe someone can mention some additional uh prerequisites for a good remote control . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Yes , well i it should have the the the the expected functionality uh of a remote control . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , s and it depends what application you are using it for . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN You might need uh We are targ targeting the television set . 
UNKNOWN We wer we were thinking television . 
CONFUSION Uh . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN So , you need to record the channels . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN You need to browse the browse the channels in upward downward way , Uh And Uh , and Marketing . 
UNKNOWN Yes , yes . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Th th that's very handy I I always miss it and on some remote controls that you can go channel up or down ins instead of retyping the number , especially when you have a lot of channels . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN And uh just before starting the detailed discussion , maybe we You are the marketing guy ? 
UNKNOWN Or th So you are the marketing . 
UNKNOWN I'm marketing . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN And you are in the u use user interface uh design . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN So just yeah I wanted to to be sure . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Sure . 
UNKNOWN And I I'm the the industrial designer okay . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN Because I I don't know you very well , actually , but yeah . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN I'm Matthew . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN You know . 
UNKNOWN Mael . 
UNKNOWN Matth s uh Anna . 
UNKNOWN Happy to meet you . 
UNKNOWN Anna . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN It's very uh Uh so yeah uh Just uh on your web pagebut uh yeah not uh not face to face . 
UNKNOWN And um uh Matthew , yeah . 
UNKNOWN A and I'm Nanne . 
UNKNOWN I thi think you know me , yeah ? 
UNKNOWN So Yes . 
UNKNOWN right yeah . 
UNKNOWN So . 
UNKNOWN Um S S s Are there some other very important things to to do well , to specify in this first phase of of the project . 
UNKNOWN So . 
UNKNOWN So mm So I Like what ? 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN So And uh , you'd need the usual ones , like the changing the volume , changing the the channel and then you uh Today we have uh um teletext and all those things . 
UNKNOWN So the browse function , as you m mentioned . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Oth yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Tomorrow you might have a some more functions which might come through that , so Yeah I_P_O_ or . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Like internet on the on T_V_ ? 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Now we are looking for television things or I_P_ . 
UNKNOWN For example personal video recorder and all those stuffs are coming up . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN But we can't really design for something that hasn't been invented yet . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Ah it's it's it's it's coming up , actually . 
UNKNOWN The personal video recorder and all those things it is coming up . 
UNKNOWN Mm , well uh I I think Uh w y you two should should , I think , think this over uh w espec what , what functionality . 
UNKNOWN Actually , yeah w Of course , and first before um designing the func well thinking about the functionalities , we need to know what are the user requirements . 
UNKNOWN Let's Let's take Oh in that case you can you always hook up with uh someone who is providing that and you know , you you sell their product as well as your product with them , you know . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um then if they need internet , then we would be able to to p to propose something with uh uh T_V_ over I_P_ . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But before Yeah , but w w we want to design a new one . 
UNKNOWN But Ninety percent of the time , ninety nine percent of the time , people will be using the main functions , the volume , the different channels , so we can have all the fancy things as well but the main controls need to be very obvious and very easy to use . 
UNKNOWN Mm mm mm . 
UNKNOWN Keep k keep in mind i it's a it's a twenty five Euro unit , so uh uh the the very fancy stuff uh w we can leave that out , I think . 
UNKNOWN So twenty five Euro you expect a quite , well normal but good functioning user friendly remote control . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN So try and get T_V_ manufacturers to Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN No , it's okay , yeah I understand . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN So we need some numbering buttons , some teletext things and then um Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN The Yeah , the main is browsing . 
UNKNOWN Yes , but but but ab about the spec the buttons , the buttons uh that will be on it . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I I think we can discuss that in the in the next meeting . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh I would like to get this wrapped up and go to an end of this meeting . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So So you know now the basic the basic things . 
UNKNOWN Okay , we are alread mm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And well just just for the next meeting , um well , uh , you wor yes , work on a design , keep it general , I mean so w we will be still fle flexible with maybe adding some functions . 
UNKNOWN L Yeah , sure . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So Um you will be working on on technical function design , so And uh you and you and uh uh uh well , think about requirements , eh ? 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Does it need internet , or or do do we stay at basic basic television uh interface . 
UNKNOWN Stam . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So , uh I think we should now all go work uh uh at this and uh you will be informed via emailand other kind of communication . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So next meeting will be in uh in thirty minutes uh . 
UNKNOWN Perfect . 
UNKNOWN K keep it in mind . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So I see all everybody's here , 'kay . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN And we can start meeting . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN What's the agendafor this meeting ? 
UNKNOWN The I will uh present here agendawith with with with slidesto you . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um as you can see here . 
UNKNOWN Perfect . 
UNKNOWN So first uh just to mention I will take notesuh of this meeting and uh I will try to work them out and give them to you . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN I've also made notesof the previous meeting and um I was about to send them you but then uh I had to go to this uh meeting so you will get them too uh Um . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Next . 
UNKNOWN So y you are the secretary also . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN Right ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Indeed . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Then I hope you all have uh worked out some some uh some some presentationsabout uh about well you the the task given to you in the previous meeting . 
UNKNOWN Perfectly yeah yeah of course uh-huh . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN W We will uh in a minutewe will uh start with them . 
UNKNOWN Um , we will see in which order we will handle them of . 
UNKNOWN Um then I will uh bring in some some some new requirements I I got uh from the uh account manager , I try to work them out , they were quite abstract , and we can have maybe have com some discussion about it . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Uh Um about the functions and Well in this meeting we should really try to reach a decision about the target group and the functionality of the Yes I mean well yes w who are we going to uh to well to sell this , the customers , indeed yes . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN You mean the social target group who we wants to target ? 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Oh the customers , okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Think that's that's important matter . 
UNKNOWN That's the big question yeah . 
CONFUSION Uh . 
UNKNOWN So And then uh we will close this meeting uh and after this meeting we'll uh we'll have a lunch . 
UNKNOWN Good . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Maybe um why uh Anna can you c do you have a presentations? 
UNKNOWN No , I don't . 
UNKNOWN You don't have presentation? 
UNKNOWN I wasn't . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN Uh you want a table to to uh Yes yes maybe maybe you can uh can just talk about it or maybe you can use the whiteboard if necessary um . 
UNKNOWN I c I can talk about it but I have no slidesor anything . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Well I've just been um presented with some research we've done in a small focus group so , a hundred people , just asked them about their remote control usage habits and what they want in a remote control . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN It's probably can't emailthis to you , I've just got a web pagewith some data on it . 
UNKNOWN Um basically it's saying that users generally dislike the look and feel of their remote controls . 
UNKNOWN Um seventy five u seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Eighty percent of users would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Current remote controls do not match well the operating behaviour of the user . 
UNKNOWN Uh seventy five percent of users said they zap a lot , so they use their remote control quite frequently while they're watching television . 
CONFUSION Uh . 
UNKNOWN Fifty percent of users say that they only use ten percent of the buttons , so they've got a remote control with a lot of functionality but really most of the time they only use a small part of that . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Do you Do you have this uh information on the web pageyou said ? 
UNKNOWN I have an a web pageyes . 
UNKNOWN Yes , mayb maybe you can can send an emailto me later uh . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN Yep , sure . 
UNKNOWN Uh about this . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So basically um there's a breakdown of how much they use the different functions on a rem remote control . 
UNKNOWN Um , power and volume selection are only used a few times within this uh per hour . 
UNKNOWN Um , channel selection is used a hundred and sixty eight times um and then there's things like channel settings , audio settings , which are only used very infrequently . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Teletext is used um fourteen times in the hour , so it is used but not nearly as much as the channel selection is used . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN An interesting thing that this reporthas brought up is that um fifty fifty percent of users reportthat the remote control gets lost a lot of the time in the room , so some way of some way of locating the remote control would be very useful to a lot of users . 
UNKNOWN Yes yes , I have that too . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Thirty four percent said it takes too long to learn to use a remote control , they want something that's easier to use straight away , more intuitive perhaps . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN It's it's easy to learn or how do you say it's Okay too much time to learn . 
UNKNOWN Thirty four percent said it took too much time to learn to use a new one . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Not enough Maybe y y you cannot put this webpage online on the Ah it's it okay it's a webpage on the C_ it's a fileokay . 
UNKNOWN And thirty twenty six percent said remote controls are bad for R_S_I_ . 
UNKNOWN I don't know how we'd go about combating that . 
UNKNOWN . 
UNKNOWN What do you mean there ? 
UNKNOWN For R_S_I_ ? 
UNKNOWN Respet Repetitive strain injury . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN So . 
UNKNOWN But Mm . 
UNKNOWN They think that or do their doctor the doctor says ? 
UNKNOWN But it's it's the opinion of the uh of the users huh ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN That's what the reportsays yeah . 
UNKNOWN So mm . 
UNKNOWN Um and then it's got a demographic breakdown on Uh I should be able to actually , if I emailit to you now . 
UNKNOWN You can disconnect it there no ? 
UNKNOWN You can maybe just just Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Oh no , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN O otherwise you yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um , s hang on . 
UNKNOWN Then you can connect this one or this one yeah . 
UNKNOWN You can connect this one . 
UNKNOWN All to your computer . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well . 
UNKNOWN So these are important numbers that Matthew and I need to take into account for our functional um Yeah Yeah these numbers have have to be have to be taken into account for the uh both yeah user interface and functional design . 
UNKNOWN Oh yeah . 
UNKNOWN Oh I need to muck around with this . 
UNKNOWN It's probably easier if you put it on yours and then I'll just emailit to you . 
UNKNOWN It's just a web link . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN One thing it goes on to talk about , which is interesting , is the hang on a minute. 
UNKNOWN Because if there are many numbers and we need to select to to constraint uh our design based on what is more important . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN Um , one thing is interesting is talking about um speech recognition in a remote control . 
UNKNOWN Speech recognition in Ah okay . 
UNKNOWN And who would pay more for that and whether people would find it useful . 
UNKNOWN D do you have numbers o o on that ? 
UNKNOWN Yes , I'll just get this up . 
UNKNOWN So that we don't Do we not need any button on the remote control it would be all based on speech . 
UNKNOWN Well potentially yeah , um I think even for interesti yeah I think that would not work so well . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Interesting idea . 
UNKNOWN You wanna have both options . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Well it would it would be a solution for uh when your remote control is lost , I mean when it has speech recognition then uh i then it doesn't matter where it is , my well it's we should be in range , or maybe it can respond and produce sound , so say where it is . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But the these are all quite fancy features I'm not sure whether we will we can make this for for twelve Euro fi and fifty cents . 
UNKNOWN Well it would be f No you can't . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And we don't know where the state of the art of speech recognition is , maybe you know ? 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN Well , it depends you know like there is uh it's a very small vocabulary that you want to do the operations like you want to say on , off , one , two , twenty three , yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN But it's quite noisy if there is the T_V_ uh shouting . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It's it's going to be li it's not going to be s so easy but u usually it's going to be more of an isolated case but it's but I don't know with twenty fi Okay it's uh decline . 
UNKNOWN Yes , that that that that's mm . 
UNKNOWN Do you have some more important facts or can we go to the next presentation? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um Well This is now talking about um who would pay for speech recognition in a remote control , who would pay more for it , um . 
UNKNOWN So you had to to to summarise maybe the Mm . 
UNKNOWN Ninety percent of the fifteen to twenty five year old market said that they would pay more , it goes down from there , seventy six percent for twenty five to thirty five , thirty five percent for thirty five to forty five , um twenty two percent for forty five to fifty five and then eight percent for fifty five to sixty five . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Decline with age , mm . 
UNKNOWN But we sh Yeah , it really depends where we're gonna be targeting this product , um , which we'll be talking about later I think . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN We will talk about it later . 
UNKNOWN Did you get the email? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Yep , that one . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Just follow that link . 
UNKNOWN I thi You us yeah yeah . 
UNKNOWN It'll be in a different window , yep . 
UNKNOWN That's left that one . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN Okay perfect . 
UNKNOWN .. . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN So that's the figure that I was just talking about there , with the different demographics . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Another thing it's talking about there is the L_C_D_ screen but there's no figures apparently on that . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Mm 'kay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN um Uh maybe uh Mael c c can you give uh uh your presentationuh ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Mm I okay I stay I can move as far as Maybe I take your chair ? 
UNKNOWN Oh , this is Mm-hmm , y y you can move , uh . 
UNKNOWN Now you can move I think yeah . 
UNKNOWN I okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN You can you can sa take my chair . 
UNKNOWN It's a channel selection , a module , this and this function , go to the . 
CONFUSION Sorry ? 
SURPRISE Oh .
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So I think as everybody knows uh I'm the uh Industrial Designer . 
UNKNOWN And uh in this presentationuh this group presentationum is gonna focus on the working design of the the remote control . 
UNKNOWN Um I'd like first to give a quick a very simple introduction , how does it work , so that everybody knows even if you don't have a very uh technical background uh what is it because I think in the product it is important . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN So basically um the basic function of a remote control is to send uh messages to another system that is fixed . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN And so an energy source feeds an integrated circuit , the chip , that can compose messages , usually uh through a um infrared bit and uh the user interface controls the chip and accordingly the the messages , alright . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So my method for um designing the yeah the work design uh yeah first the the main point is that I would wish to to make a really functional product . 
UNKNOWN I would prefer to have very functional um capabilities rather than fancy stuff that in fact is not used and doesn't work . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So for that yeah as it's important to take into account the user requirements from the Marketing uh Expert uh Anna and um w to to we should agree on what are the technical functions uh for this remote control and I show you the the working design . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So um basically uh here is a really large view of what we want . 
UNKNOWN Uh we want an on off button , it can be uh it's simple but it's it's important , and also uh the to both channels as well as other buttons that come after , right . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN So the components I quickly drawhere , is that in this part you have the remote control the the sender and on the other part the receiver so that's my method is um will be to well my aim would be to uh design the and choose the chips and the infrared um components to build the remote control right . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So of course we need energy sources and uh uh the receiver a a receiver . 
UNKNOWN This is very quick uh design , uh you stop me or interrupt me if uh you don't agree on it on that . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN And um so what I have found and after a lot of work actually I I drawthis I drawfor you this uh schemathat can be maybe too technical for you but is very important for me you know . 
UNKNOWN Well . 
UNKNOWN Uh-huh . 
UNKNOWN You drew it a long time ago ? 
UNKNOWN Is huh overwhelming . 
UNKNOWN And uh that's it so I won't go into details about that but uh these are my preferences to use uh that kind of components . 
UNKNOWN Ninety one . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN And and why do you want these kind of component ? 
UNKNOWN So . 
UNKNOWN I mean , are they cheap , or are they uh reliable ? 
UNKNOWN What were your Mm . 
UNKNOWN So the the main components you see here are the cheapest I have found and yeah th you have always a compromise with uh reliability and uh i if it's expensive , but uh this one was not this one also really uh reliable um so yeah that's it for the working design , uh I hope you get clearer view on uh what what a remote control is uh in terms of uh technical components but maybe yeah No no no no we we will uh This is a preference but we can always change uh Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN It it it's more clear now I think . 
UNKNOWN So Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN But is it uh can you just buy it on the market and f plug it in or you want to ma Well it to du it's just you had to change the frequencies . 
UNKNOWN What I w what I was thinking about uh the the the schemauh about uh the sender and the receiver , I mean can you can you get back to it ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah uh , the receiver is of course already in the television and we are not uh able to change it . 
UNKNOWN Of course yeah . 
UNKNOWN So we we must adapt to the to the receiver . 
UNKNOWN I I suppose there is a standard uh way of communicating to televisions uh . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN We will use uh infrared protocol uh using yeah infrared and uh and of course we need to adapt to that protocol that already exists and but we what we can do is uh uh adapting the the chips inside uh to the best uh chips and uh infrared bubbles . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFUSION Um . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
THANKS Thank you . 
UNKNOWN The frequencies ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Of course yeah in the chip you have it yeah . 
UNKNOWN But you should be careful , people are sometime becoming problem , like a guy has recently designed a remote uh uh uh which could switch off any other T_V_s , so basically through all the things . 
UNKNOWN That can control o other things . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Ah . 
UNKNOWN So maybe we should think of yeah . 
UNKNOWN Of course yeah we should take that into account in the uh Yes . 
UNKNOWN Yeah yes I I I I I feel I I I think M Mael will will consider this uh th these things . 
UNKNOWN That's handy . 
UNKNOWN So if the b T_V_ in the next apartment's really loud , you can just turn it off . 
UNKNOWN Yeah so you can just go on the street and then switch off everyone's T_V_ and you can just walk away You don't have to be near the T_V_ at all . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I like that idea . 
UNKNOWN Maybe Maybe we can go to to your presentationuh Matthew . 
UNKNOWN Yeah so . 
UNKNOWN I I I assume you were finished here . 
UNKNOWN Uh okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So I can take I think mine now there . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Okay so voila . 
UNKNOWN Hmm I can take mine it's okay , voila , mm so mm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN I Uh , sorry ? 
UNKNOWN I know where it is . 
UNKNOWN It's on the desktop . 
UNKNOWN It's uh Yes . 
UNKNOWN Technical function . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN It's uh Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Like so . 
UNKNOWN Well . 
UNKNOWN So um I'm going to talk a little bit about the technical function so wha what actually it's about what is the user going to do , I think my last presented what is going inside , so what's the user is going to see from the outside and how he is going to use it . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN So well the approach is that uh basically the idea is to send a message to the T_V_ set , as Mael has pointed , and it will be decoded by the T_V_ and usually we it is easier to have uh keys or buttons with which people can uh press and then um changing a button will basically uh change the message which is being sent to the T_V_ and uh um a and basically it sends an internal signal and decoded by the receiver . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So p as um Anna has said that this ki people are interested in things which are you don't need to k press the keys , people are can have a speech recognition but this is uh s a question which will we have to see later . 
UNKNOWN But in the present scenario is that you have certain keys and you press it like your mobile phone , and it sends a message to the T_V_ . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN And um so generally mm I don't have some figures sorry but um so there are two kinds of uh remote if you popularly in the household , actually so you have a standard T_V_ remote where you have just a on , off button and play , uh volume change and uh keys for the number and more than one digit option . 
UNKNOWN And if you see for example righ right now uh uh even the one uh on more than one digit option is for two digit channel which is like ninety nine , but tomorrow you might have one fifty channels you know to browse or two hundred channels to browse who knows , but uh uh . 
UNKNOWN Then there is uh this is the standard one with without any fancy thing you know like i it doesn't have teletext option , it can without any , it's a very simple thing , um which which you can vouch . 
UNKNOWN And then you have uh what's the v video remote filewhich is like usually it has almost all the keys over there and , but it then it has other options like stop uh and then you play the movie or uh or fo fast forward the movie or something like that so i it has those so these are the standard uh commonly found remote controls in the uh market . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN And then whi which is generally used by the people . 
UNKNOWN And then well personal preferences I would uh basically think of having a kind of aim for the next generation thing where the we could have both the uh the f a T_V_ and the remote video remote control because uh some of the keys in the video's remote control and the T_V_ they could be integrated together so that uh we could um aim for the like in the f coming future um that type of uh applications with Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN How would that work ? 
UNKNOWN So you've got say maybe a V_C_R_ and a T_V_ which are separate , so you on my one at home I've got a V_C_R_ remote which then changes the channel on the V_C_R_ and doesn't do anything on the T_V_ , so is it gonna be like a switch on the remote that says t use the T_V_ or use the V_C_R_ ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN or does it know which one you want to use ? 
UNKNOWN Um actually um you could you could think of um having s a y you can have a key which could tell y it could go to the video thing but um uh yo you you you still can't um in that case when it you use that the function should be able to take up the V_C_R_ option and you could play it or You can also think about having like um I in a few days you will be ha in in few ye coming years you might even have a system where you have a separate uh sitting setup box and uh you have uh um something like uh uh you do you do you suppose you are not able to watch some programme and actually it downloading all the time for you and uh you can just you know uh when you come back you could just switch on that thing and uh watch a program . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN In that case you want to browse faster , browse slow , you want to have those kind of functionalities . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Mm mm mm mm mm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN These are kind of next generation functionalities . 
UNKNOWN It's the next generation thing , but it is going to come in couple of years . 
UNKNOWN Mm yes , but I think it's i i it's already there , I mean the hard disk uh recorders uh I I've seen them in the shop . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN It's goi Yeah it's Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Mm 'kay . 
UNKNOWN So it's going to record your things and you and you you need basically the functionalities what you need in both uh uh video as well as in the standard T_V_ thing . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN That's fair enough . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN But I don't think we're trying to make a universal remote here . 
UNKNOWN No no we are not making a universal remote , we are just looking at uh giving a scenario , I have a T_V_ and tomorrow I am going to have set up box which is going to sit there and uh it's going to do that job for me . 
UNKNOWN That's , yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Because y Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN W w w w we need to decide on on on on in how far we go to in this . 
UNKNOWN Mean , you can go pretty far I f I think with with with functions and possible uh future p uh prospects yes . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So Okay so that p ends my presentation. 
UNKNOWN But it's good to keep in mind . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Very well . 
UNKNOWN Well . 
UNKNOWN So we can always discuss about it for example uh the presently the video market actually uh this demand , video over-demand or what we call it as , it's presently booming up actually so it i like people are providing like uh things like uh uh movies , you can select actually so you want to watch a movie and uh your p your provider gives a list of movies , and then you select those list . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And it basically you go off , it downloads the movie , it gives for you and then when you come you want to loo watch it on your T_V_ . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN And thi this is going to come . 
UNKNOWN Good . 
UNKNOWN Or even you don't need to download it , it's streamed uh online uh yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah it can be streamed online for you and you can say what time I want to watch the movie and Yeah so . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Um , so u um I have uh received some some some some well points of of thinking over of my account manager and uh I would like to share them with you . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um first thing is uh teletext is a well known feature of televisions but it's it's getting used less and less . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN That's that's especially because of the internet of course . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN So we should think about it um . 
UNKNOWN Do we include it , and do we give it a prominent uh prominent uh place on on on the on well huh on the remote mot control itself . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Uh as uh a in any case it's it's not used , well very much , but it's it is still used . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Um further yes we must think , uh do we stay uh to to television only , the television as we as we all know it with with broadcasting signals and you can't go back uh huh , or do we uh uh go further as Matthew indicated by supporting uh uh recording uh devices ? 
UNKNOWN Uh indeed indeed . 
UNKNOWN So D_V_D_s and V_C_R_s ? 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN And and and the hard disk recorders . 
UNKNOWN Um , furthermore , uh , w we need really need to interest uh y younger customers and then with younger customers I mean people uh below the age of forty , and our our current customers are mainly forty plus uh which well Forty . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Fourteen or for O okay . 
UNKNOWN So Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So that's to that's I mean there's a market but uh they will grow older older and you'll al always need to have the the future with younger people . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um therefore , younger people like trendy trendy designs, so that's w we should make our our our R_C_ as trendy as possible but it should also be uh have a reliable image , so when it looks too too spacey or too fancy people will think well does it work at all . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah it's uh well you you can follow the ideas how you want to keep the keys , you know right now if you take it you have like zero , one , two , three like a keys separately , but suppose if you take the the present trend of mobile phones there are like big thick keys you press on the top , it takes one number , you press on the bottom it takes another number , and uh basically uh uh so the space covered so that you don't see two separate keys there actually so it it is like uh um i i it is like uh Yeah so . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Ma Maybe Maybe you can drawit on the on the board uh Hmm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN But I think taking the idea of getting inspiration from mobile phones is interesting , especially if we're going after a younger market , that's the the the mm the new and the funky things , that's , yeah , there's lot there's lots of pretty mobile phones , not too many pretty remote controls . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yes yes mo Yes it's recognisable Mm mm . 
UNKNOWN Because they are already used to that , you know , product . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN That's Mm . 
UNKNOWN And and they are skilled uh by using it . 
UNKNOWN So for example uh Well uh Okay , it works . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN .. . 
UNKNOWN Fine . 
UNKNOWN So , for example you have uh presently uh keys like one , two , three like this , actually , and uh uh four five six like that and uh you can have keys like this in form like uh keys like that Forty minutes ? 
UNKNOWN Mael can you hand me over this uh ? 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN Uh thank you . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN How much longer have we got for the meeting by the way ? 
UNKNOWN Mm well I think fi five min Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause we haven't talked about demographic at all and it's a very important issue . 
UNKNOWN Yeah so you you you can have uh keys like uh which are which are like so . 
UNKNOWN too sorry , so we basically don't change the uh original order of them but then the keys are more spacious , they don't look uh so there there is a very sligh thing , so if you press on the top it takes the one , it takes the three , uh four , sorry four here uh five and six , so the keys can be it looks you know not very much cluttered but it looks nice for you don't have too many keys but you can have a lot of options t if you press on the to Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN 'Kay I I think now that the idea's clear . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Uh we should now uh try to decide um on our target group . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Which I think is quite tricky . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um , basically we're trying to get people to buy a remote control wouldn't they already have a remote control with their television when they buy one ? 
UNKNOWN Of course they have already one . 
UNKNOWN So our our our remote control has to be better . 
UNKNOWN But it's not going to have more functionality , 'cause it's only a low market , it's a cheap-end remote control , we can't beat modern functionality , we might we'll be able to beat them on th the look of it , th the design of it but that's not a big seller , if they're not just going to buy a new remote control just 'cause it looks pretty , they have to actually need it as well . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So I'm not sure how we can get people to buy this thing . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN I well I think many people said uh in your in in your research uh uh uh the appearance of the uh R_C_ is is important when they are buying one but Indeed . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But why are they buying one in the first place ? 
UNKNOWN So that will be about functionality Mm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN But if people are buying a new remote control for functionality they'll buy a universal remote . 
UNKNOWN I've got friends who've got so many things they need a universal remote , otherwise they're using five different remotes for their all their things . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN In that case they wouldn't buy our product , because it doesn't give them what they need in terms of functionality . 
UNKNOWN So your you think we should go for a more u universal high-performance What do What do you think about What componen I don't know . 
UNKNOWN Well , we can't , with the price range . 
UNKNOWN We We're not building a universal remote , we're not building a high end product . 
UNKNOWN Yeah we have yeah twelve point five Euros uh per uh per R_ s R_C_ and I think uh with this now you know that chips are very uh cheaps and uh we can include it in our control some new new features . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And um But yeah that's Ye I don't think L_C_D_ is not necessary well , th for long term . 
UNKNOWN But yeah . 
UNKNOWN If we're getting into universal remote territory , we're getting to L_C_D_ screens and things like that which would drive the cost up a lot . 
UNKNOWN I don't know whether that's necessary . 
UNKNOWN Is the L_C_D_ screen I think thi this could be this could be a market because uh universal remote controls uh tend to be uh quite expensive . 
UNKNOWN For universal remotes If you mm . 
UNKNOWN And quite complicated to use , yes . 
UNKNOWN S so we can try to go in between , and offer a product which is not as expensive and not as complicated but but still but still people have the idea this is more functional than a normal uh uh R_C_ because it has more uh it it is in some kind universal . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Not as flexible maybe , yeah , but s yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Universal . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN But if we're going for the say fifteen to twenty five age group then not many of them would actually own T_V_s to use a remote control on . 
UNKNOWN Mm yes but w we're targeting I think on more on the on the twenty to forty group . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So they're yeah . 
UNKNOWN People yes . 
UNKNOWN Who just have or already have a job and have the money but may not want to spend that much money on a on a universal universal control . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN I don't know really what the the price range for remote controls is . 
UNKNOWN Are we gonna be at the very bottom of the price range , or are we kind of middle to bottom ? 
UNKNOWN I don't know . 
UNKNOWN Uh well I think uh when we think it over I thi I think we are trying to offer the a kind of universal control for for less money . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So d Do you agree ? 
UNKNOWN Well Well I it's fine with me like the price as long as it is uh not too expensive . 
UNKNOWN Yeah because we have to take into account that we are gonna b we are gonna sell uh four aro around four million so when we speak about these numbers uh the price of a chip is uh price of a chip is very cheap . 
UNKNOWN Uh and it d uh Our provin Mm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN So I'm okay for designing um a ne uh less yeah a a kind of universal uh R_C_ yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN You think it's possible for the twelve Euro fifty ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um so then we we decide on on on going to this more universal kind of control . 
UNKNOWN Uh yeah , that's that's what we needed basically . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Uh that's needed right now . 
UNKNOWN And uh basically you can look to the standards of other Actu Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah that's needed , yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN And if we want to get the market , we really need that . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So I guess what I'd like from a universal remote is maybe choosing between three devices , being able to switch between them , there may be stereo , V_C_R_ and T_V_ . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN Exactly . 
UNKNOWN And just be able to s use them all from the same remote , but not at the same time . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN Yeah you can also browse through all the standards you know , where are the limit of standards for all of them and you can just browse through them . 
UNKNOWN Is that okay for you ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Mm mm mm mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So given we are going for this uh uh universal type uh m maybe it is good when you try to find out which components you therefore need and y you will try to get more specific uh user interface content and uh maybe you can look on on what trends are in this uh in this type of market . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm yep . 
UNKNOWN Voila . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN So anyone uh has a point to bring in or shall we no . 
UNKNOWN So . 
UNKNOWN Well . 
UNKNOWN Oh I don't have anything right now . 
UNKNOWN We can we'll we'll go and we'll I'm sure we'll up something good for the Yeah so we meet in well what are our Okay . 
UNKNOWN Oh that's that's fine then . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN W yes , we uh we can have lunch now . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So um Then th th the next meeting will uh after lunch you have uh we have uh thirty minutes of work and then we have the next meeting . 
UNKNOWN But you will be informed via the computer . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Cool . 
UNKNOWN Okay perfect . 
UNKNOWN So see you later . 
UNKNOWN Right first time this time . 
UNKNOWN Nu There we go . 
UNKNOWN It's not that complicated , but I get it wrong every time . 
UNKNOWN Okay so we are just waiting for Matthew . 
UNKNOWN For Matthew , yep . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Uh So I suggest we start the meeting uh without Matthew uh he's uh obviously late for some reason . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Mm 'kay . 
UNKNOWN Good . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Today uh we will uh talk about uh conceptual design . 
UNKNOWN I hope uh you both did some uh some work uh concerning a uh conceptual design . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um this will be the uh agendafor the meeting uh . 
UNKNOWN Uh I will take some minutesuh again . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um we will have the presentationsof y of you different team members , and then try to come to decisions uh about the concepts uh you have presented . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN So and that uh will uh we have some uh forty minutes uh to complete this uh . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So um who has the fir do you ha Anna do you have your presentationready ? 
UNKNOWN I have a presentation, I'm just making this Okay I'll just emailyou this file, my presentation. 
UNKNOWN Yeah I think yeah the Matthew it is it's important that Matthew yeah is here because it's really a a team uh project with a team and if someone is not here then we cannot but it's okay it's good . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Ah there is Matthew . 
UNKNOWN Sorry . 
UNKNOWN So . 
UNKNOWN Good . 
UNKNOWN Do presentationready ? 
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm I'm just emailing it to you . 
UNKNOWN Oh okay . 
UNKNOWN So Yeah I sent you the slides, you didn't see them ? 
UNKNOWN So did you manage uh Oh yes I see him , good yes . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN . 
UNKNOWN So 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN Okay it should've gone through to you . 
UNKNOWN Okay mm yes I have it . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Okay so this is just a presentationon uh the trends that we're gonna use to make the product stand out from the rest of the products out there at the moment . 
UNKNOWN Um can I just put this on ? 
UNKNOWN So we have to work out a way what we can do with our product to make it stand out and make it so people wanna buy it . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN This is to do this I will not remove my microphone . 
UNKNOWN We basically used um some focus group surveys which I went through with you last time , the main results of that , and um some research on the current design um and fashion trends that are out there at the moment um , and as part of this The important aspects that came out were things that we've already discussed really . 
UNKNOWN The most important by far was the look and feel of it . 
UNKNOWN It needs to be something that's very different from everything else out there . 
UNKNOWN It needs to stand out . 
UNKNOWN It needs to be not functional like the rest of the things out there at the moment . 
UNKNOWN Most people find remote controls boring at the moment , we need to have something that looks interesting , that looks exciting , that will stand out . 
UNKNOWN People will wanna buy it . 
UNKNOWN Um That was twice as i important as the next item on here which is that it has to be technologically innovative has to have something else , apart from just the look of it . 
UNKNOWN People have to then think about it and say got something there that I want . 
UNKNOWN That's a really cool feature , and it has to make them wanna buy it again . 
UNKNOWN Third on the list , and again innovative was twice as important as this last um aspect , it has to be easy to use . 
UNKNOWN So they have to be able to be able to look at it and have some intuitive idea of how to use it um . 
UNKNOWN Drawingon the fashion trends at the moment , uh fruit and vegetables um . 
UNKNOWN This is basically talking about just the the feel of it , so probably not the smell of it , but the bright colours , um eye-catching , really bold designs, and a spongy feel . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Um I had a talk to the design people about this , but having a remote that's tactile , that feels different , that would be really cool . 
UNKNOWN That would make it stand out . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN So can you repeat and be more precise about what you just said ? 
UNKNOWN Spongy feel ? 
UNKNOWN Uh about the feeling yeah uh yo Okay . 
UNKNOWN Well ma make it not necessar sp spongy is the current thing . 
UNKNOWN You can Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Spongy is the current texture , but basically there are no reports no remotes at the moment which are spongy or tactile at all , so if we make it like maybe furry or soft or something , that'll be something that sets it apart , rather than just bare plastic which they all are at the moment . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So as far as the design goes , the very most important aspect was the design , to the customers . 
UNKNOWN So going with the fruit and vegetable idea , we've got the bright colours , so makes it stand out , the oranges and the the bright yellows and the florescent colours , part of the fruit and vegetables um . 
UNKNOWN Going back to the idea of taking inspiration from mobile phones , they've all got those a lot of them have the changeable covers , so they can choose what colour the outside is . 
UNKNOWN That's one way of looking at it um . 
UNKNOWN Textured feel we just talked about . 
UNKNOWN Maybe it's another way of doing that . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So if it's part of the the changeable covers then may maybe they can choose a different texture , a spongy one or a soft one or something like that . 
UNKNOWN So they can choose it li as they want to to maybe to fit in with their decor in their living room , or just what they like , their sports team or whatever . 
UNKNOWN Yeah that's a very good idea , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um and yeah , still taking the inspiration from the mobile phone design so functionality , the way the mobile phones work , the way the keypad looks . 
UNKNOWN Also just the way that a lot of industrial design is going into mobile phones at the moment . 
UNKNOWN They're big selling items . 
UNKNOWN People put a lot of thought into that so we can leverage off that , and we can start using some of their ideas . 
UNKNOWN Um back to technological in in innovation , not quite as important , but still a big issue . 
UNKNOWN Um we talked about having a way of finding a remote control if it's been lost , uh that's one thing we could look at . 
UNKNOWN There are other aspects like L_C_D_ screens and speech recognition which weren't I don't think , in my personal opinion , gonna be worth the extra expense and the extra effort that will go into them . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN I think we're better doing something basic like this which is very important and very will be a really cool feature to put in . 
UNKNOWN And use . 
UNKNOWN I had no real specific ideas for this , maybe we just , the basic idea of having your core functions big and at the top maybe , by themselves , and then yeah and then th th the finer details of buttons you don't use as much either hidden away or completely separate . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Yes well maybe Matthew can can give some more information on the Mm . 
UNKNOWN Voila . 
UNKNOWN Yep and that's the presentation. 
UNKNOWN Okay good , that's very clear . 
UNKNOWN Yeah very clear . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN So does anyone have any comments or ideas on that ? 
UNKNOWN Uh Maybe we yes well we maybe can decide later on um the l the the look and feel of uh I've it was a good idea maybe to to Yes the the the there are changeable covers , but on the other hand I I don't know whether my superiors would be so glad with it because you have to introduce a complete uh uh new l line of uh of supplies uh it would be uh very complicated uh organisational Hmm . 
UNKNOWN I think you Hmm . 
UNKNOWN To let the people choose , you mean ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well we're selling so many units of this . 
UNKNOWN This is gonna be a mass marketed product , we can afford to have two or three different designsat least . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah a range of uh yeah , a set of three , four different aspects . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN Mm mm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Sure that fits the Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yes and of course it will be a we we get a if it works we can get uh after-sales I mean that would would be very good I mean those covers could go for for three , five Euro . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN That's a very good idea um And then uh maybe uh we can go a th Matthew's presentationbecause the Together indeed uh , because you ma might have some some information on the the easy to use , what you were already mentioning . 
UNKNOWN Yeah s then we could discuss later like we can put all ideas together . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah yeah I agree . 
UNKNOWN It should be easier with that . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And your part is very related to mine because when you suggest something then it has to be integrated inside . 
UNKNOWN So Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah so I'll I'll go with that actually so um Okay so m so then the the idea of uh having a remote is generally you have uh different keys and uh different structures , different forms , and uh they could be like buttons or like and um they could be of uh a varying sizes if you want to to uh basically emphasize a particular key more than the other , and uh maybe like you can have different colours for example having the r red for the on off switching on and off the button . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So this this is the general trend to ha the method they do . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So what I have found was that uh currently uh the they are mostly that the T_V_ , V_C_R_ , music system operated ones actually , and they are very specific to each other , but there are some common keys for example if you want to follow the V_C_R_ and if you want to follow the uh g uh s some uh soundtrack on the w w see they have the common thing actually you can have and uh There is also um a speech recognition to store channel information , names , like You can basically if you have a multiple functionality , say T_V_ , V_C_R_ or something I say it to the T_V_ and the T_V_ , and you can programme the keys if you want to , certain keys are even the channel information . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN I like the idea though of having speech recognition for like the n the name of a channel like B_B_C_ , rather than having to remember the the number of it on the keypad . 
UNKNOWN Yeah yeah so you you you can just uh because uh as more and more channels come then you have more and more problems to remember the v v exact channel numbers ex exactly , even if you arrange it by however you arrange it , you still have the problem to remember exactly which channel you want to So it it it's like it limited one . 
UNKNOWN That's a good idea . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah I really like that idea . 
UNKNOWN So what functionalities do you suggest for that ? 
UNKNOWN For facing this problem ? 
UNKNOWN In the present market I saw it that says something like they are looking for eighty word thing , eighty word , which shouldn't be th that difficult to implement , like eighty to hundred word . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Basically you want you don't want to store all the channels in the remote control , you want to st store your favourite channel . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Maybe ten channels , yeah at the most . 
UNKNOWN Yeah some ten twelve channel information . 
UNKNOWN You know you don't want to st store all the hundred channel information into that . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN And uh basically uh it depends like the remote with L_C_D_ display for browsing because you have multiple functionalities for example you are watching a movie , and uh uh you are having a universal remote control and you want to uh you don't know really which functionality is now , so I am using the T_V_ so every time I use it , it could be like , for example I can use a simple toggle switch , and a display , so I press it so the display says , okay , I'm in T_V_ or D_V_D_ or whatever it is , instead of having three keys separately for four keys , to model the functionalities will increase actually , and for you and you might want you don't want separate keys for all of them . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Oh yeah yeah yeah mm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN You can't . 
UNKNOWN And uh well there can be children friendly where you can programme your remote so that they they are not allowed uh to browse certain channels which you can block them , and you can operate them . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So these are the things presently which are seen in the market scenarios at present . 
UNKNOWN I personally would look at things like having a u universal remote , is uh um is a good idea , like instead of having unusual ones for all of them you can think of having , um with multiple functionality possibly with speech recognition . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN I got a mailfrom the the coffee machine interface unit that uh they have uh integrated the s speech recognition into a into the coffee machine , and so if you say hello coffee machine , it say hi Joe , or something like that , you know , and uh Yeah you you won't be using it , so it's a limited vocabulary mm thing , and very isolated word and it's uh it is interesting , and basically storing the channel through voice or other ways of programming your keys , on the display for the browsing which is again and maybe having something like a blinking thing , like uh it could indicate you're uh it it could indicate what is cal like the uh whether uh you you have enough battery in your in your uh remote , the blinking . 
UNKNOWN Mm b But a coffee machine , there's not too many words they'd be using with that it's a it's a small vocabulary . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN At the same time , if it's a dark room , it can be used to locate the remote also or Yeah you can let them to do that . 
UNKNOWN And you want okay for coming back to one point y you want to let the user to programming the keys ? 
UNKNOWN Two thirty five supposed to finish . 
UNKNOWN Some of them ? 
UNKNOWN And uh isn't that too difficult for the we want w I don't know if we still want the um R_C_ to be easy to use , that's the compromise . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN N no but the if you give it d depends on the easiness like the user how much effort he can put . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Like for example uh I would like to store in certain way , so if you want to give the full freedom to the user or you want to keep some constraints and let the user use it with that constraint . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think you can do it both ways . 
UNKNOWN So it de So So Yeah . 
UNKNOWN You can have it so it's easy they can pick it up and use it straight away without doing anythi without customizing it , or if they want to they have the option of using these extra features . 
UNKNOWN A standard . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um yes but but I do maybe you can give a hand to us because I I'm not sure whether that that we can implement that for twelve Euro and fifty cents . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I'm sorry to have Every time I have to come down on this price again to so this might be a little limiting for your creativity , but it's it's it's the real We have to consider it . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN S so do we think these ideas an and my uh sp speech recognition , I mean maybe it's possible for for twelve Euro but then then it will be at cost of other functionality we might implement like the uh uh the the the furry uh uh case of the Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm yeah like I would say that for programming uh keys , you said , uh it could be uh easily uh done within the the package of twel twelve Euros , but for the A_S_R_ system , uh I'm not sure if it's feasible to have this or We Exactly yeah i if if it's a low vocabulary it's already implemented , and w how much it's cost , maybe with a f cheap chip . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN We well we can still look at we can talk with the coffee unit and you can uh check how much how much they yeah yeah yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Maybe we can come we we can talk to them , and we can come with that , you know . 
UNKNOWN Mm mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And also well you can think of having uh since you have a you know something maybe if you added little bit of display , you might need the to che keep checking the battery , so you really need a some kind of indicator , so it could be a blinking option of L_E_D_ it could actually be used to detect also . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN If it's in a dark room you can basically detect it also . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN So No actually i if i it is like you know it tells you um , it can be for two purposes , like if you have an L_C_D_ display and all those things it's not going to be the standard remote , which is having uh which need just uh six six volt uh th sorry three volts um of D_C_ . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN I like the idea too of being able to use the remote in the dark , so either having the buttons so you can feel the difference between them or if they if they light up or something . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN It may need more actually , so y you you may need to check your battery usage it and then you need that , some functionality to indicate the battery limit . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN It's true . 
UNKNOWN And then if the battery limit is indicated , if it could be ind indicated through a blinking something and it can change the colour depending on your uh how much is the battery , well that is good enough to even locate even if you want to . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN You know . 
UNKNOWN 'Kay good . 
UNKNOWN . 
UNKNOWN Yeah so You you have time some more ? 
UNKNOWN I don't know how if if I have time to talk about the Okay . 
UNKNOWN Mm yes um I would Yes yes you can you can still . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN We have time . 
UNKNOWN Sure you can you know . 
UNKNOWN So what I'm gonna present here is very uh um yeah basic knowledge about the all the the components that are inside a a R_C_ a remote control , and how is it manufactured h what is the process , just to explain you . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So the method is ther there is a a set of components in a in a remote control like , and uh what cost the the components in themself do not cost a lot but the the way to assemble everything costs obviously , and I will uh show you my preferences uh uh at the end . 
UNKNOWN So there are two uh different types of uh um Two different ways of using the the components for making a a remote control . 
UNKNOWN Nice . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Uh the basic way is to use a an integrated circuit and some uh transistors with an that aims at communicating uh uh the message and to to send the message to the um to the led that will uh transmit to the receiver . 
UNKNOWN And uh yeah the other components and the circuit board buttons , infrared , led , etcetera , for the components um . 
UNKNOWN So you finding , just to say that the chip can detect uh when a key is pressed , and then it translate to the key , to a sequence , something like morse code , as you know , uh with a different sequence for each key , and uh uh that's , with the components we will use , we will have different uh messages , different sequences , and the chips sends that signal signal to the transistor that amplify to make it stronger um . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So electronic parts are assembled onto uh printed boards uh because it's easier to mass produce and assemble . 
UNKNOWN And uh so I think for our design we want some b uh programmable uh you know V_ V_L_S_I_ or F_P_G_A_ uh high technology , and this is important , and also we'll use uh yeah like in any uh high-tech uh devices a chip of fi fibreglass to them and connect them . 
UNKNOWN Yeah mm mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So my personal design we need to find a solution what um what is the material of the cover we want to use . 
UNKNOWN If it's plastic or you said that yeah you had some ideas uh like fruit , veg or I dunno . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Well well m m maybe m maybe we can give the uh the uh the case a very uh uh normal a v very normal case but , with the changeable covers to fancy it up . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So like a normal cheap plastic case which can be covered up in , for instance , a wooden case . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN I mean just what Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Mm just have a yeah Just the veneer on it , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah like they do in with cars I think . 
UNKNOWN Yeah inside the car yeah . 
UNKNOWN So they also emailed me that uh they have available a bunch of different buttons , a scroll wheels , integrated push buttons s such as a computer mouse . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And uh very cheap L_C_D_s , so liquid crystal displays , so I'm wondering , I think we might be able to integrate L_C_D_ into our R_C_ . 
UNKNOWN And the final point okay is um we have yeah there are some uh compromise to to do . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN So we have to know that the push button requires a simple chip , but the scroll wheel uh and that kind of higher high-tech stuff needs more money um which is a higher price range alright . 
UNKNOWN And the display requires an advanced chip , which in turns is more expensive than the regular chip , but I think uh with twelve Euros um and if it's uh uh made for mm four million uh items , then I think w we could be able to handle that . 
UNKNOWN So to to sum up um we need yeah so I I just said that the components uh the list of components uh has to be uh yeah listed and um and um assembly is a an important process that has to be taken into account . 
UNKNOWN And uh for the designing of the cove uh uh cover layoutthen it's better to to to maybe see that with uh the the U_R_ exp U_R_I_ Expert so that we can it's really a team-working uh . 
UNKNOWN Sorry . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN So I I cannot design something without your agreement , right ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah so of course for example uh I wanted to know like if you want to have a a fo if you want to have the L_C_D_ display over there , or if you want to store a programmes with a keys What kind of things you'll need inside your thin inside W wh what W what Okay . 
UNKNOWN No of course . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN Yeah it's kind of um simple pro progra programmable device , and we have to insert . 
UNKNOWN I think we could insert one that could underlie several functions of Exactly yeah , for customizing and yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Okay so in that case you can even look at the technology what the mobile phone is trying to use with the card . 
UNKNOWN Yeah where they do all the wi with with them actually . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN How f cost effective it would be to put that car chip into it and do the programmable things . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So So I f I think we we should come to some decisions now uh a about this . 
UNKNOWN Yeah good idea . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um so I understand uh when we want a display we need a expensive chip , but when we want a scrolling wheel w we also need the expensive chip , so can we use same chip , so with one expensive chip we can uh implement several complicated uh or advanced features . 
UNKNOWN Exactly yeah that's a very good idea , we could have uh one main chip uh that could handle , uh it's called F_P_G_A_ chip , that could handle both uh like scrolling wheels as well as uh L_C_D_ and yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So when the more expensive chip you mentioned there is is possible in the in the given budget , uh maybe we should go for for the more expensive chip , so all features uh which you mentioned can be implemented based on the same chip . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN D well Well I don't know if it'll fit into our cost of twelve point five Euro you know . 
UNKNOWN Do you think that's feasible ? 
UNKNOWN Uh You th you think it's possible . 
UNKNOWN Is it possible to fit in to that ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah also thinking , I think both uh if we had a budget of twenty twenty uh Euros , it will be okay , but uh . 
UNKNOWN Sorry . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Well maybe we need specific costings then . 
UNKNOWN Actually do maybe two designsand then cost them out and see which one is gonna fit in our budget better . 
UNKNOWN Yeah that's an excellent idea . 
UNKNOWN Mm yes wh when you make a a design ca you can next meeting you can give an quite an exact cost price . 
UNKNOWN Yeah yeah . 
UNKNOWN That w that would be a very good idea . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah because right now I don't have price in in head but for next meeting I'm sure yeah be able to do that . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Good good . 
UNKNOWN Yeah that's uh that's something which I wanted to ask you also , like what will be the each individually the cost of it . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN For example if f if you want to put wood I wouldn't suggest for wood uh 'cause it's I think it's m much easier to use a plastic or a rubber rather than wood . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN I agree on that . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It will be much ch much expensive th though it's the most natural thing , but Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yes but I can I think uh I think we can just use more cheap plastic for a kind of basic edition , and then people can fancy it up with with more expensive materials which which come with a with another price . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah it's uh Yeah we we can give a preference to them , but it is but with plastic or the rubber or whatever it is it's much better with that rather than going for Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Do do you agree ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah but i it's a detailed uh yeah yeah uh plastic versus uh wood , and we need maybe to centre our description on uh the the really the what buttons what uh functionality we want to offer to the user , and maybe with uh graphs or I don't know uh User Interface Designer you could maybe uh help us on that . 
UNKNOWN Mm yeah sure . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Ma I I think uh for next meeting we c you two can present a real design . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yea Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Uh so drawingit on the board . 
UNKNOWN Perfect yeah . 
UNKNOWN And then we now sh only have to t to decide the general function uh . 
UNKNOWN So um Let let's say next meeting w you produce two designs, one one one less advanced and one more advanced and with the cost price . 
UNKNOWN Yeah sure . 
UNKNOWN Yeah we will uh Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Uh furthermore we go for the for the uh basic plastic case which can be later uh fancied up with uh with addit uh additional uh , how do you call them , these like like mobile telephones you can put a cover over it . 
CONFUSION Uh . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But that that that that can be done later . 
UNKNOWN Yeah customized . 
UNKNOWN We now can concentrate on the on the basic remote control . 
UNKNOWN . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFUSION Um . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN We can give them smooth keys , you know . 
UNKNOWN Smooth keys with bigger s uh So that you know The the problem most of the time we've seen , the keys is that it's small , and every time we have to be very but if i the if we if we go to a different ways of designing those keys , then you can merge them together to Oh you can actually , for example , if you see , they are they are they are quite small over here , and uh now you can , for example , as I was if you make them big , it may change the look of the thing also to the people . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN So is there any of these that you're looking at particularly or is this just ideas ? 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN At the same time , it is m more uh like it would be more interesting for people who are having this R_S_I_ and all problem . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Mm yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yes yes yes bi big keys is is good thing I think . 
UNKNOWN Uh big keys may better for them actually and uh Yeah . 
UNKNOWN You see ? 
UNKNOWN I agree yeah , and not too m too many keys of course yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN No no . 
UNKNOWN Mm well one I've had before , a r r remote control we have at home is one that's actually got a cover on the bottom so the bottom bit is just , covers half the keys most of the time , and then you can slidethe cover back to get to the the more advanced keys . 
UNKNOWN Mm mm mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Mm w but then you have still have uh when you don't use it you have such a a an extent of your remote control which you don't use . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN So maybe it's possible uh , I don't know whether you can can indicate this , that you can elsewhere open your remote control and on the inside are uh buttons you don't use that much . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um yeah I've seen that before too . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Anoth another like b it flips up and then you've got another layer of buttons underneath . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN Yeah so it's something like this , the model here s you can put the keys Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN But I've seen also with keys and buttons on the top of here as well . 
UNKNOWN That's what you mean ? 
UNKNOWN Yes I I th that's what I mean so I mean something like like a book. 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I like this one . 
UNKNOWN I like the shape of this one . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Can we have can we think about maybe having a a non-recta non non-rectangular one , so with not just the straight little box that's a maybe curved or something . 
UNKNOWN Yeah I like also this one . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , the point is w maybe we need to also to make a decision on how how how big we want to be and how many buttons like n we should dec decide numbers or Okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , mm . 
UNKNOWN Mm mm 'kay . 
UNKNOWN We should make a Yeah that yeah next meeting we should be Yeah that would depend upon us actually . 
UNKNOWN Is this for the next meeting though ? 
UNKNOWN I think we might be out of time out of time for this meeting . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Ju just make two designs, and the we we can decide decide between th those designs. 
UNKNOWN Yeah yeah yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN Yeah okay . 
UNKNOWN I think that would be a good idea . 
UNKNOWN Perfect . 
UNKNOWN So anyone uh any questions for now ? 
UNKNOWN No no . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN I don't have . 
UNKNOWN So is this is there anything else I need to do from a marketing point of view for the next meeting ? 
UNKNOWN Um yes I come to that uh uh Yes well m maybe uh , I don't know whether that's possible , maybe you can start evaluating uh their work somehow . 
UNKNOWN Maybe it would be interesting if you could look um for the cost inventories of other devices , if you're using speech recognition or something like that . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Okay well is this me designing a way to evaluate it so Thinking about how to set up test groups and things ? 
UNKNOWN I don't know whether that's possible uh in the given time but a as far as possible . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So uh you two will be together w working on a o on two prototypes and further instructions will be uh will be sent to you by uh by email. 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN Exactly . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Two or three prototypes ? 
UNKNOWN Two . 
UNKNOWN Two . 
UNKNOWN Two ? 
UNKNOWN One for like cost and the one with like higher-end so that then we can be easily comparing them or you know find a compromise between both of them , yeah that's how it is . 
UNKNOWN I Mm and then Hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah and find maybe a compromise . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Yes okay . 
UNKNOWN Perfect yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN Okay let's call this to an end . 
UNKNOWN Mm 'kay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Thanks guys . 
CONFIRMATION Thanks . 
UNKNOWN So we are done for now . 
UNKNOWN . 
UNKNOWN Did you get my emailwith the slides? 
UNKNOWN Ah . 
UNKNOWN Tricky . 
UNKNOWN I guess I have to change the pen otherwise . 
UNKNOWN Will be completely different . 
CONFUSION Dunno . 
UNKNOWN Maybe they're supposed the pen's supposed to go over the seats . 
UNKNOWN Might be seat floor rather than person . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , put it back . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And do you think it's . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Jo's making faces at me . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So . 
UNKNOWN Matthew is uh late again . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Probably an important man . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN So well it is important for him to be here uh . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So what can you ? 
UNKNOWN He he he You did work together didn't you ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah we will yeah , so I will be able to to summarize uh our meeting , but still I think uh it would be in very important if the uh as um main designer . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN I think we can put on the here . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN Uh basically w yeah we we designed the two uh items . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Um yes but w we Yes , maybe we should phone him . 
UNKNOWN Um , can we have a phone , can someone it's really w well designed . 
UNKNOWN Um well Um , when he is not here we will just we just have to continue . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Mm , object tracking . 
UNKNOWN Um so just for record I I will take uh notesagain . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN And um well first thing uh I was uh uh I got an emailfrom uh from my superior again that we really should stay within the budget of the uh twelve Euro and fifty cents . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN It's uh well he said to me well uh when you stay in it's good , when you don't stay in you have to redesign . 
UNKNOWN There is no uh no negotiation uh possible in this matter . 
UNKNOWN So we have to consider that . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN Good . 
UNKNOWN Um so maybe Anna , you can have your presentation. 
UNKNOWN Well we can't no we can't do evaluation 'til we have a design . 
UNKNOWN Okay Matthew . 
UNKNOWN Nice uh you are here . 
CONFIRMATION Great . 
CONFIRMATION Great . 
CONFIRMATION Great . 
UNKNOWN Oh ma maybe then you can start now with mm presenting your uh your designs. 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN So I will start by the the basic one that uh fits into uh eight Euros actually , right , seven eight Euros , and uh well first for both they have um a special shape , maybe the designer can uh explain better than me , but uh it's like a surf board . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN And you you are supposed to surf to browse to surf T_V_ , maybe the web , and uh it's kind of interesting shape because um unconsciously people want to s to surf when they see this stuff . 
UNKNOWN Mm 'kay . 
UNKNOWN Or browse . 
UNKNOWN And also it's not too far from um a mobile . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So people are used to that kind of shape , right . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Don't take care too much about the colour because w yeah we don't take yeah . 
UNKNOWN Now we are supposed to give some oper offers right now . 
UNKNOWN So here would be basically the the the infrared uh uh led yeah L_A_ L_A_ L_E_D_ , the on-off button , in red . 
UNKNOWN Eye . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN I yeah . 
UNKNOWN L_E_D_ . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Here would be the volume . 
UNKNOWN Oh yeah . 
UNKNOWN On the on the left , okay , so easy to turn on t and off . 
UNKNOWN Uh-huh . 
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm , hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN And um so this is a very cheap version so there are maybe you can carry on uh Matthew . 
UNKNOWN Also so you have uh uh browsing the channels , actually so you can go up and down the channels , uh , if you have a video or something you can forward , back . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN How can you change from V_C_R_ to uh T_V_ , by the way ? 
UNKNOWN Oh no no no , this is a single this this is a model with just the T_V_ one . 
UNKNOWN Okay yeah . 
UNKNOWN No no just sorry , this is a standard T_V_ one , we are not talking about that . 
UNKNOWN Yeah yeah . 
UNKNOWN Ah , okay . 
UNKNOWN So and then we have usually there twelve keys but we know that we rel that we have only ten digits . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN The extra two are for uh having or giving an option for uh having more than one channel . 
UNKNOWN And the other one is for the teletext or something you want to browse through from that . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Okay so it's it's t a very basic remote then , it's only Mm . 
UNKNOWN Actually . 
UNKNOWN It's a very basic minimal thing which you can which is which is also available in the market , actually that's what it that it i and would cost us to build it about eight Euros . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Seven , eight , ei eight Euros . 
UNKNOWN Exce except for the for the special shape , the surfing board , it has a quite a a conventional layoutof buttons uh . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So this one model and uh yeah . 
UNKNOWN Can I see ? 
CONFIRMATION Thanks . 
CONFIRMATION Sure . 
UNKNOWN Okay I like the volume control , that's good . 
UNKNOWN Th this is a magic one but I know we don't want to talk about that , you know like uh i i i it is a very futuristic , it's like uh it's like a brain machine interface and all this stuff we are thinking about in the future , it can come . 
UNKNOWN Uh-huh . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So it doesn't actually have buttons . 
UNKNOWN So that uh then what we look t yeah . 
UNKNOWN Did you wanna see ? 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah no you can carry on , I just look how it feels all . 
UNKNOWN This is a model , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yes it really feels like like like a mobile phone . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN Just I'm I really want to talk to it . 
UNKNOWN Yeah actually , yeah . 
UNKNOWN But . 
UNKNOWN It won't talk back . 
UNKNOWN So but but continue with your uh mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Uh so well then the this is the a more a little uh smooth and it gives a lot of functionality , uh in this way , so all we have uh th you see there are only six keys , but don't worry they are ma they are doing the job of twelve keys actually here . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN And so they have more space actually and uh it's easy to uh use this and uh you have um so this is a standard uh uh infrared eye , and then you have a power button , which l volume , what you have , and then other than that you have uh channel up and down and uh f slow pause or s slow lo yeah s pause or stop , and uh then uh you can uh you have a L_C_D_ display , here and uh y this is a functional thing which can change like it's a toggle switch which could change the function say , y you press it Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Play , pause . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN From D_V_D_ player to television or something . 
UNKNOWN Exactly yeah . 
UNKNOWN I really can change it , so Instead of having many switches , y The L_C_D_ can display what is that on that , and uh well you can have a integrated microphone over here , or in the button th here , so which can uh basically you want to do a speech recognition and uh that channel a lot of information can be di displayed here directly on the um on your on your display . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN To audio and to video on demand . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Yes and and and then you get feedback via the L_C_D_ yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN This is the orange button , the microphone . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION An Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And here is a small L_E_D_ which is like blinking one , which tells you like uh are you running out of the battery , and which is can be useful for the locating as I was talking earlier okay . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN And uh well then we have a cover basically , basically you don't need much of the time this , when you need you can use it , and this gives additional functionality that tomorrow you want you can add a tactile thing to this cover you know . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Crazy dis designer , okay . 
UNKNOWN Design enter . 
UNKNOWN Yeah but but but but uh i in there uh when this is closed , will it also uh cover up the L_C_D_ screen ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah yeah yeah yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It's basically to do that . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But but the L_C_D_ screen I mean is a very uh well an eye-attracting feature which shouldn't be shouldn't be That th that's true . 
UNKNOWN Actually when you are watching the T_V_ , when you are watching anything or listening to them , you hardly care about what is getting displayed here , you know , uh you want to uh and this gives a protection to the L_C_D_ actually , giving a cover to that actually . 
UNKNOWN Oh actually well . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Gives a protection because when it falls down or something it it is it is is is it gives a protec it's more robust that way . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN Yes , more robust . 
UNKNOWN Yes okay . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Uh yeah . 
UNKNOWN And you have very good chances Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It's low weight . 
UNKNOWN You have to see yeah yeah the the components we put inside is very low weight . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So the the cost is actually a bit more , it's uh it's it's sixteen Francs . 
UNKNOWN It Sixteen Euros . 
UNKNOWN Sixteen Euros sorry . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So it's well outside the budget then . 
UNKNOWN Then it's out of budget . 
UNKNOWN But the the main point we we talk about that with our uh manufacturer . 
UNKNOWN But w Mm 'kay . 
UNKNOWN And they say basically that the S_R_ system would be uh something like three Francs per item so three Euros sorry . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Three Euros . 
UNKNOWN And um No no no , part of that , yeah . 
UNKNOWN That's on top of the sixteen , or is it part of that ? 
UNKNOWN Part of that . 
UNKNOWN So that takes it down to thirteen Euros without the speech recognition . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Well uh if you we can have if you have new more ideas we can add new more uh some more keys if you want to you know Yeah it it should not be cluttering up everything . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Well I think th th yeah we should stick with uh a number of keys because if we add too much then it's too Locati . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN What's this one on the side ? 
UNKNOWN Ah that's for the it's kind of a L_E_D_ for indicating your battery and as well as it's like a blinking one you know you can keep it aside . 
UNKNOWN Location . 
UNKNOWN Ah okay . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Mm 'kay . 
UNKNOWN I like the shape of them , I do like the the size and the the shape . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well well Mm . 
UNKNOWN Be before ta talking about the money and what's possible and what is not possible , maybe Anna you can uh give our uh give us your um Yes . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN And maybe we run the evaluation on both of the products , both of these two . 
UNKNOWN Evalua evaluation and also the evaluation criteria , so what what is important to look at . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Basically this is what we've talked about already , um , from the marketing point of view . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN We just wanna make sure that we've taken into account Yep . 
UNKNOWN Well just do it quickly if if we al already . 
UNKNOWN So it's just a shortlist of criteria on um the things that we've identified as being important to selling the product . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um we just go through these and rate them as a group and then at the end we'll make an evaluation based on that , so just average the score of those items , so These are the things we identified as being important . 
UNKNOWN Um the three things were look and feel , innovation and ease of use , were the three important components um appealing to the correct demographic so using those things in the right way to appeal to our demographic . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN And then goin following the company motto , following the fashion trends and putting that into the product as well . 
UNKNOWN So well do you wanna go through and put through those on the the two products now or do we wanna discuss them further and then evaluate them ? 
UNKNOWN Um , n no why not why not discuss uh discuss it now , Mm , well my my personal view is uh w when when this one is eight Euros we must think how can we improve it . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So f just go through onto the whiteboard I guess . 
UNKNOWN Not sure how this is gonna come out . 
UNKNOWN So the first one was really very far below budget , would you want to take the price down of the end product according to that or just have the high profit on it ? 
UNKNOWN 'Cause if we're only going to make it for eight Euros then we have a Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN And then I mean w w w you must just see it we can still spend this four and a half Euro and to r because th th th the the selling price is already prite fik uh uh quite fixed on twenty five Euros so we just have to offer as much as as well value for the for the customer uh he can have for twenty five Euro . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Functionality . 
UNKNOWN Okay so look and feel , innovation Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN And now it easy to use . 
UNKNOWN Easy to use . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN target . 
UNKNOWN And trends . 
UNKNOWN Oh , you following the idea of using the um removable covers on these ? 
UNKNOWN Is that part of both of them or ? 
UNKNOWN Um well w w we can still discuss that . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So um , and together with evaluating this uh we we might come with new ideas I mean adding things or uh removing uh of options because they are too expensive , but um I've received uh a framework which we can do this . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN I mean did you have this this Excel sheet? 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
NEGATION No . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN No okay , this is these are the the the latest prices of our production uh uh production unit for several components , so we can uh see whether the the price is is within the twelve Euro uh fifty cents uh . 
NEGATION No . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So maybe we can start with this , uh , calling this one . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN So it's the pink . 
UNKNOWN Th th this is the first design . 
UNKNOWN And the other one's green . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so look and feel ? 
UNKNOWN Where um one is I've broken the pen again . 
UNKNOWN Uh there is another pen . 
UNKNOWN S yeah . 
UNKNOWN Get that one . 
UNKNOWN Um w one's bad and seven's the best . 
UNKNOWN Sorry , one's true and seven's false . 
UNKNOWN One's the best . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So on a scale of one to seven ? 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So . 
UNKNOWN Look and feel . 
UNKNOWN Well you already feel that uh pretty much I think . 
UNKNOWN In i in my opinion purely feel is is is very good , is very good in your hand , so I I I would consider two or or may maybe even one for feel . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN But that's just half , we should also consider look , and then i it looks quite conventional . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Don't you agree ? 
UNKNOWN Mm yeah . 
UNKNOWN On the scale u it's between functional and fancy basically we're looking at , so Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So maybe two . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Ma ma ma ma maybe say say five I It's my opinion , but I don't know what what Four , four . 
UNKNOWN Well I will give it maybe we have anyways the way we have designed it's like the surf as you say you know . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It though the look is fine but uh still I will give four in that case you know . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Four maybe . 
UNKNOWN Four ? 
UNKNOWN Four yeah that Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Now we th th then we settle on four . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN I will gi yeah . 
CONFUSION Uh . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN Can you maybe fix the other Mm , try it , just try it . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN If you press like this not like this then you But Okay . 
UNKNOWN No that's the ink's dried . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN C can you get the batteries ? 
UNKNOWN No no the battery has fallen down , that's i Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Battery's low , isn't it the ink ? 
UNKNOWN The b that's the that that one ? 
UNKNOWN battery there . 
UNKNOWN No no it's not that , it's how to close a battery . 
UNKNOWN Okay ? 
UNKNOWN Now it should be . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN No I think it's lost a battery . 
UNKNOWN No it's It would still write but it wouldn't pick it up with the sensors . 
UNKNOWN Oh it will not ri mm , mm . 
UNKNOWN Is there another battery there ? 
UNKNOWN Oh yeah . 
UNKNOWN You got a second ? 
UNKNOWN Try a Perfect . 
UNKNOWN Well we won't be able to tell . 
UNKNOWN Yes , it it has a mm . 
UNKNOWN Is that working ? 
UNKNOWN Did it come out ? 
UNKNOWN Good . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Good . 
UNKNOWN Good . 
UNKNOWN Because we'll be able to see it still even if it wasn't working , it's just a normal whiteboard marker but it wouldn't be picked up on the the actual whiteboard . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So then then Ah . 
UNKNOWN And the other one ? 
UNKNOWN Wow . 
UNKNOWN I think it's slightly better , um , it's hard to tell from just the plasticine , but Mm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN I I I When we want to include I I I'm doubting about this this component . 
UNKNOWN It it it it breaks in your Mm , yes I see , mm okay . 
UNKNOWN 'Kay maybe It's not a button it's a led , it's a Ac actually yeah it should be embedded . 
UNKNOWN No actually this is this is not going to protrude actually , it it's n i it is jus It's a led actually which which 'll be covering in a curve It's will be embedded there so it won't be really you know protruding or something . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Oh you can push push it again , you can push it . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN The other thing is , is the left hand one protruding ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause if people are left handed they want to use the other hand , maybe it won't work so well . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN No you it it not protruding actually , it will go in better into that Uh it's fine I think . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Well r r Mm . 
UNKNOWN I'd say two or three for that one , personally . 
UNKNOWN Probably more towards three than two . 
UNKNOWN I think the look is better but the feel is is is worse . 
UNKNOWN So so I would also say this is four . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN But w w do you what do you think ? 
UNKNOWN My just that um the feel is that um you right now you you don't see the feel because right uh for example if you press it quite inside now like this , now it's embedded one . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN This is how embedded one will Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yes , it basically is the same shape . 
UNKNOWN It's a bas basically the same thing actually . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN You will be Except that in this c Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN And the L_C_D_ makes it better . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And you might have a slight thing for to forward and Yeah , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Mm , okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So I will say two . 
UNKNOWN Yeah it's d it's definitely more fancier than that one . 
UNKNOWN Yes , okay . 
UNKNOWN I would say two , three . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So , consensus ? 
UNKNOWN Two or three ? 
UNKNOWN Two ? 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Two ? 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN Two's good yes . 
UNKNOWN looking like No but except for the design of the surf . 
UNKNOWN Um , 'kay . 
UNKNOWN Innovation . 
UNKNOWN The first one , not really muc Mm . 
UNKNOWN Basically there is no innovation in the first one compared to what exists in the market , right ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Do we Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN The surf uh design . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN What What features are we actually including ? 
UNKNOWN You should be rea Uh no I think it's more of the feel . 
UNKNOWN Are we including like a location kind of thing like trying to find it ? 
UNKNOWN There's nothing like that ? 
UNKNOWN But th is there any there's no actual innovation in that at all , it's just a straight-out remote control . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN The only innova innovation is the shape . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Say about that . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN S so that Mm . 
UNKNOWN So there's no this uh look and feel thing , though that's not a technological innovation . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN You're right . 
UNKNOWN So I'd be up for seven for innovation . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And the And the second one is really uh state of the art , uh in terms of innovation . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN And um with many more functionalities , and can open and close the the bottom part . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , it gives it Yep . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN A and the L_C_D_ screen is That's that's that's well it's quite innovative . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And all the scrolling uh buttons and menu and pro programmable device behind this . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Uh could put it at one or two I would say . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Personally . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN So what is it , what are the innovations with this ? 
UNKNOWN Got the L_C_D_ screen . 
UNKNOWN Uh Yeah automatic speech recognition . 
UNKNOWN Is that in this one though ? 
UNKNOWN Is this 'cause this is the Th th there were different options we discussed then , we discussed the one that was in budget and the one that was out of budget . 
UNKNOWN No , we ha Yeah , eight Euros yeah . 
UNKNOWN We just diske discuss it as you designed it and then we will will try to get it in the budget . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So the cost for these were what was the cost for the first one ? 
UNKNOWN So Eight . 
UNKNOWN Eight Euros ? 
UNKNOWN Eight . 
UNKNOWN Well actually we have yeah to check again yeah . 
UNKNOWN And this one was sixteen Euros . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN Sixteen . 
UNKNOWN Sixteen Euros . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So . 
UNKNOWN Innovation for this one is two ? 
UNKNOWN One ? 
UNKNOWN It's a two , I would say two . 
UNKNOWN Two ? 
UNKNOWN W W un to be one what would do we nee actually , yeah , I don't see okay , one would would be without buttons , . 
UNKNOWN Two . 
UNKNOWN Why it is one . 
UNKNOWN A man w w Yes . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well the speech recognition is a very good innovation I believe it , so Give it a one ? 
UNKNOWN Bu Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So maybe we can put one . 
UNKNOWN This this is it w with the speech recognition ? 
UNKNOWN It's using speech recognition , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well . 
UNKNOWN Gi given that that it works , then it's I think one . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , one , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Ease of use ? 
UNKNOWN Uh He is used to it act They are used to it actually . 
UNKNOWN So the first one is really standard , so everybody i including our grandmothers can use it , right ? 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN So that's maybe a a two for ease of use . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Here there may Uh , though it has more functionality I think it shouldn't be for the user to learn it actually . 
UNKNOWN Um , the other one is quite easy , tho though . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN It shouldn't be diffi Uh yeah , actually in fact I think it will be Yeah Yeah but y Well we have reduced the keys actually you see . 
UNKNOWN So maybe a three or a four . 
UNKNOWN One me um we hope maybe sometimes people get uh scared with the number of buttons . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN And there is a like I would say three . 
UNKNOWN Or maybe four . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Consensus ? 
UNKNOWN Three or four ? 
UNKNOWN Three , I would . 
UNKNOWN Three is fine with me . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah because it's n uh it's not like a big one with uh one hundred buttons or so , This one would be uh for grandmothers . 
UNKNOWN Three ? 
UNKNOWN Three . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah it's a actually the user has to put some effort to do use that actually , it's not so easy , like this one the normal . 
NEGATION No . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yes but then when when he is used to it , i i it is quite easy . 
UNKNOWN Is quite easy yeah . 
UNKNOWN So so I think th three is good . 
UNKNOWN Initially there there is a lot of effort , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Good . 
UNKNOWN What's the next ? 
UNKNOWN So three's uh how well it goes to the target demographic . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN So we're d we're still thinking twenty to forty year olds ? 
UNKNOWN So Twe twenty to forty , yes that's Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN That's Mm . 
UNKNOWN Oh no , this would I I would I would give this model to the old people actually . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , grandmothers , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So sh completely changed our demographic there , it's not part of the the funky young thing . 
UNKNOWN And Oh yeah , . 
UNKNOWN Well exce except for the surfing shape . 
UNKNOWN Yeah that's true . 
UNKNOWN I mean that's that's something which which has an appeal on this group I think , but Mm w w w we after this we can can consider uh for instance , making this more attractive to to the demographic Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN If it was the very bottom price range or it was like between this and another one we did the same thing then I can imagine it being applying to the the demographic yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN That's it's still Ye Mm . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause we have got room , we've got some budget there to add a few things to it , that's right . 
UNKNOWN But as it is now , I w would say mm , six , something . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Do you agree ? 
UNKNOWN And Mm . 
UNKNOWN I Well I think Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah because it's so important it's i it was written that it really so important , the um the the look and uh taking care of its it targets , the right range of people , right ? 
UNKNOWN Uh yeah but but if you sell it in the market it's going to be cheap , actually . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But w Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But it's going to be cheap whatever though , it was set with i we've got a set price . 
UNKNOWN So And people can still decide to use the cheaper one instead of a Okay . 
UNKNOWN But for us it's yeah we have a constraint that we need to sell at twenty five Euros . 
UNKNOWN Mm , yeah , indeed . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN There's nothing that would make me spend an extra k few Euros on that one rather than another one . 
UNKNOWN Th t t Ju just think , twenty five Euros , I mean it's not going to be cheaper . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So in that case well it's fine then . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN We can yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um and the demokraphi demographic of the second one ? 
UNKNOWN And the demographics of Yeah I think it's uh it has more market actually . 
UNKNOWN It's got the got the the toys in it , it's got the L_C_D_ screen and Mm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah tha tha tha tha tha that's I think it's better , because of the L_C_D_ screen which is really an appeal on the on the on the on the and on the Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And if you want to target yeah if we we wish to to sell four millions of this , I think for this audience we need absolutely the L_C_D_ screen . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So , the L_C_D_ screen uh attracts , yes . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Because it Mm , ma maybe that's something to consider , yes , so . 
UNKNOWN I think especially if we're gonna n have an L_C_D_ screen on a low range product then that's good . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Wh what what No s say t two . 
UNKNOWN I'd probably go with three again for that one . 
UNKNOWN Or even Even one and two . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Y yeah , you know two . 
UNKNOWN Or two . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So , two , yeah ? 
UNKNOWN Two ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Two yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah two yeah . 
UNKNOWN Because tomorrow this will be more appealing because you can add lot of sophistication on that . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Because then you you have it uh d you have lot of things which you can include for the people to We have to practically test it . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN And especially I guess 'cause this has the speech recognition as well , and that makes it more appealing , it's more of a a new fun toy . 
UNKNOWN The field test will tell you how good . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Okay , the final point , trends . 
UNKNOWN And following the trends . 
UNKNOWN The trends . 
UNKNOWN So the trends were the fruit and vegetables and the spongy feel . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN So as it is , not really doing either of them . 
UNKNOWN I think Mm . 
UNKNOWN Spongy , uh , that means that it goes in in the water . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Well , the spongy could be part of the the feel of the buttons as well , I know some have you tried the mobile phones that have got the kinda spongy buttons and not not exactly spongy but I'm thinking one of the Nokias that's got like you ca it hasn't got individual buttons it's got just a one bit on it and so you can that feels kinda spongy . 
UNKNOWN Uh okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah I know . 
UNKNOWN But this one includes this feature , right ? 
UNKNOWN Spongy buttons . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN We we we we we yeah , it's the way they are going to be , actually . 
UNKNOWN So it's sort of , yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN So Uh the maybe in the colour we can make it uh fruit and and veggie . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN But that's if you're using the covers . 
UNKNOWN And the then we can al yes . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Or is it just one Well they make it for mobiles , it can't be that much more complicated . 
UNKNOWN We can we can consider uh uh is it possible do you think , to to make a cover for s such a phone ? 
UNKNOWN I mean Well just with the with the flexible plastic uh I th I th I think O o or just two things which can be put on each other . 
UNKNOWN But why do you want to cover that actually ? 
UNKNOWN In that uh w in the mod Uh uh y are you sure ? 
UNKNOWN So you got the option of having different colours or different textures . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN This is possible . 
UNKNOWN Yeah I think yeah it should be possible like what we do with the mobile phone , yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah exactly like Nokia phones . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Yes , exactly like it . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN Uh , so Maybe we can but we have to decide it , we can put the the the fancy f look of vegetables for instance , to to these covers and s now try to invest in the in in the features . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN I think the if we do the cover that's really going with the company's philosophy of having the fashion in in electronics , it lets people have the latest fashion even next year when fruit and vegetables might be out , you'll still be able to put a new cover on it and then it'll still be in fashion . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Mm mm mm mm mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause sometimes look at this computer , th this laptop , it's all black , and uh it's quite conventional , and sometimes people don't like too much flashy colours like this one presented here . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN So maybe we could do like in the range the set of what we propose a black one , very standard one , that meets the the requirements of th such people that want really standard uh things . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN And then you have the option of having the different colours , different covers . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN So so so that that would make the trends equal , so we we we really have don't have , I mean Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN There's n yeah . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause that's the that's the feature that could be included in either of them . 
UNKNOWN Although it is more with the spongy buttons on the um on the other one . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , so a a point better for the for the number two . 
UNKNOWN Yes , indeed . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So . 
UNKNOWN Two and three , or one and two ? 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , it's one . 
UNKNOWN Say , say one and two . 
UNKNOWN One and two . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So le le let's see . 
UNKNOWN So d this one has spongy but buttons ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , it says a One point six , one point One point eight yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , the blue one uh spongy . 
UNKNOWN Mm , I see , yes okay . 
UNKNOWN Okay so the average of that is three six nine divided by five , so five mm nine by five , one point s eight ? 
UNKNOWN Good . 
UNKNOWN Just add it . 
UNKNOWN Nine . 
UNKNOWN You know . 
UNKNOWN Three , six , seven . 
UNKNOWN This one , eleven thirteen nineteen twenty one , divided by five is four point two yep . 
UNKNOWN Four point Uh four point two . 
CONFIRMATION Very good . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN But we still got a very different price for those two so they're not really comparable yet anyway . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN We we must try to get them closer . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , it's right , yeah that's right . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN Both in i i or we just have to choose . 
UNKNOWN Wow . 
UNKNOWN And adapt . 
UNKNOWN Because , when we choose for this one we have to we have to make it more attractive and w when we to d for this one we have to make it more cheap . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Well it's easier to just make that one cheaper by just taking the speech recognition out . 
UNKNOWN That'll basically take us down to the budget . 
UNKNOWN Yes , well But I'm now did y did you work with the same prices that I have here ? 
UNKNOWN So I I give yeah I just give a call with the manufacturer uh and uh I explained them and they told me this could be possible for sixteen Fr Euros . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Uh unfortunately we didn't see this chip , uh Matthew , so maybe we have to recap with this one . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN Mm , tha Well yes , well uh re reconsider it . 
UNKNOWN Maybe we ought to reconsider everything with this , yeah . 
UNKNOWN So let's let's try to to model this this phone in this sheet, uh what kind of energy source uh I I we didn't speak about that . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN It's a it's a normal battery , or Yes . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , it migh It it'll need uh more than a conventional one , it won't be uh just maybe you might use a A_A_ battery actually . 
UNKNOWN What do you say , Mael ? 
UNKNOWN For this one it's a normal battery . 
UNKNOWN Just so one battery . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN Electronics . 
UNKNOWN given speech recognition I think w you should go for the less fancy chip . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh sample speaker , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , yes , or sample sensor , yes . 
UNKNOWN Sample , yeah , this one . 
UNKNOWN Yes , this one . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Case ? 
UNKNOWN Um , I see I Double curve . 
UNKNOWN So So which one are we talking to ? 
UNKNOWN Curved . 
UNKNOWN Double curved yeah right . 
UNKNOWN It's uh Are you talking about this or that ? 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , it's gonna be more than just the biggest case , definitely . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Well Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Either of them . 
UNKNOWN Oh yes , we are talking about , but they have the same shape , but , actually bu So th th this would be double curves ? 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN They're both going to be not basic cases . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN Uh , plastic would be the material . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN The basic one , yep . 
UNKNOWN Is it zero Franc ? 
UNKNOWN A special colour ? 
UNKNOWN Uh special colour , now we leave it to the covers . 
UNKNOWN Uh Ah good . 
UNKNOWN So now we're either going button or L_C_D_s , L_C_D_ display . 
UNKNOWN Push . 
UNKNOWN Mm , yes , but Yeah th now this is per per unit , this number of components . 
UNKNOWN L_C_D_ is . 
UNKNOWN It's okay . 
UNKNOWN Just say L_C_D_ . 
UNKNOWN Is that price per unit , or for the whole thing ? 
UNKNOWN So it would need twelve buttons . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , we might need a scroll wheel , right , for that ? 
UNKNOWN No but for this one it's twelve Euro . 
UNKNOWN No , for that one also . 
UNKNOWN There are twelve ? 
UNKNOWN So , one , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight , nine , t Yes . 
UNKNOWN Yeah that's a scroll . 
UNKNOWN Twelve I believe . 
UNKNOWN So this comes to eighteen . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN And that's without any special button supplements . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , one scroll wheel you might need . 
UNKNOWN So So I think but th do you agree th that thi Yes I Yes I'm I'm no I'm no I'm not sh sure . 
UNKNOWN So we'd have a special colour , special form and special material on all of them . 
UNKNOWN They're not just standard buttons . 
UNKNOWN Uh Bad estimate , right ? 
UNKNOWN Wait a minute, it's not it's not double curved , it's single curved , right ? 
UNKNOWN Because it's there is no like . 
UNKNOWN But I thought it would be curved on two it's like it's curved on the sides and curved on the top and bottom as well , that's what I thought . 
UNKNOWN Well it's you know this curve like this so , it's w there is only is is is there is nothing like y you know in the other stuff there are yeah concave . 
UNKNOWN Yes I kno undes I understand what you mean , yes . 
UNKNOWN You talking about concave curves ? 
UNKNOWN Uh-huh . 
UNKNOWN So I think we can put um the single curved in the sixteen . 
UNKNOWN Both . 
UNKNOWN You think a single curved ? 
UNKNOWN That makes uh seventeen . 
UNKNOWN And what are just The bt buttons , we have twelve buttons , are you sure ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN Uh W d we have we haven't talk about a , but that's no a is very exp inexpensive I believe but it is not in the list . 
UNKNOWN We have more , we've got those the scroll wheel on the side and yeah The sc Mm . 
UNKNOWN So I had a bad uh bad estimation . 
UNKNOWN We've got a scroll wheel for the volume don't we , or is it some other thing that's not on there . 
UNKNOWN W ho h is this a scroll wheel or is this a a a sort of button which can be pressed on two sides uh so for higher and lower ? 
UNKNOWN No no no . 
UNKNOWN 'Kay we've only got five minutes left guys so we need to wrap it up pretty fast . 
UNKNOWN Yes , a kind of scroll wheel . 
UNKNOWN So this is even more than the um than the cost you gave , the sixteen Euros . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so based on that , yeah , um where is the es okay sample speaker But still , yeah it No we cannot , yeah . 
UNKNOWN That is the sample sensor and sample speaker . 
UNKNOWN So um We're We We could go for the for the for the for the for a simple chip , but then we can't have the the speech recognition , yes ? 
UNKNOWN We just need that actually . 
UNKNOWN We need one . 
UNKNOWN Yes ? 
UNKNOWN So so w when we w a this would this would be cutting the speech recognition . 
UNKNOWN So But the um Yeah but if you have the near the L_C_D_ you can um choose select between um you know like uni universal between audio , T_V_ and V_C_R_ , and this needs a needs a advanced chip . 
UNKNOWN S Oh I i it I think it's going to be y y yeah it's th with the regular chip , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Transti Say say it's regular , regular chip , and we still on fifteen , so Yes but that maybe Well we can just say one . 
UNKNOWN Right , Matthew ? 
UNKNOWN Or regular chip ? 
UNKNOWN I think yeah regular , today we you can do that with regular chip . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So . 
UNKNOWN And what about the number of buttons buttons uh my Matthew ? 
UNKNOWN Uh Yeah . 
UNKNOWN When you look at this w , this u uh item , But You cannot make a phone to your boss saying twelve fifty is really really low , no ? 
UNKNOWN Ca l we are just when we just want to uh to cut the number of buttons we have to make seven to to fit in in twelve twelve fifty . 
UNKNOWN So is it possible ? 
UNKNOWN But that's seven basic buttons right , seven buttons without any adds-on , without special colours or form or material . 
UNKNOWN That'll be then we have uh have to ask the user to press it several times . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN No no , he he he I I Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Well So the L_C_D_ display is is three Francs , sorry three Euros , by itself . 
UNKNOWN And uh we don't want to to change that right ? 
UNKNOWN We we really want a L_C_D_ other otherwise we w wouldn not get the market . 
UNKNOWN Uh Or we could even replace them by buttons actually . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Otherwise y you ha you have a s ve very normal uh thing like this . 
UNKNOWN It's evident . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN So twelve Euro fifty , we got two off of the battery , we can't do anything about that , so ten fifty , if we want an L_C_D_ dispra display , that's seven fifty um , so we've got seven fifty to use for the case and for the buttons . 
UNKNOWN And I dunno So wha what what each of us think about the because it's measure point the L_C_D_ , um Do you think it's important ? 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN And the chip . 
UNKNOWN Sorry the chip's up there already . 
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm , mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So we're gonna have to scale this down to get within budget , there's no doubt about that . 
UNKNOWN A Mm Mm . 
UNKNOWN Because sometimes whe when you watch the T_V_ in fact , you have a big display and maybe you don't need one more in your hands ? 
UNKNOWN I dunno , I'm just asking . 
UNKNOWN A actually it depends , it depends what kind of functionalities you want to add into it , for example if you add two more functionalities then better you add two more buttons , or and you'll have L_C_D_ display which is that is going to bring the cost by two two Euros at least . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think , unless we can really drive these prices down we need to get rid of the L_C_D_ display . 
UNKNOWN Okay so we can get rid of it and then add a couple of buttons . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , it's true yeah . 
UNKNOWN But uh , do we want that ? 
UNKNOWN On the market point of view , yeah . 
UNKNOWN What do you think uh , L_C_D_ is a major feature , or ? 
UNKNOWN I I think we have to come to a decision now , just I I think we we what we just do i is vote about the uh the L_C_D_ uh display so Yes . 
UNKNOWN For the price , it's gonna be what we can afford , and it's looking like we can't afford the L_C_D_ display , there's no way we can get it in there . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN You assume , you want a democratic voyt vote , right ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN One man one vote . 
UNKNOWN S so who thinks the the L_C_D_ disply display should be i should be in it ? 
UNKNOWN I th I'd like t it to be in but I can't see it happening . 
UNKNOWN I can't see it fitting in . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN I think but Yeah but the only thing is that what is the multiple functionalities you want to include with that . 
UNKNOWN We need to be . 
UNKNOWN Bu y you're a power voter uh veto anyway as Project Manager . 
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm , I know , but Yes . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN . 
UNKNOWN well we have to make a decision now , that's it . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So uh uh having an L_C_D_ s display is just uh uh have very very limited amount of buttons . 
UNKNOWN Is that acceptable ? 
UNKNOWN Ca can I have can the functions be implement in an You've you you agree . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN W I I I just Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So hav hav having seven buttons , instead of twelve . 
UNKNOWN So that wou would be cutting cutting suh say about these buttons . 
UNKNOWN Because one yeah th show me that uh actually we could in fact we move these three buttons and have three uh possibilities for each of the three here . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Here one , at the middle , and at the bottom . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN I think then we we're really losing ease of use . 
UNKNOWN Okay , . 
UNKNOWN That will create another problem . 
UNKNOWN For the people to use it . 
UNKNOWN It's not going to be easy . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Doing that . 
UNKNOWN So um I I think we should we should cut the L_C_D_ screen . 
UNKNOWN That that's that's my opinion . 
UNKNOWN No , it's okay , you uh cut the L_C_D_ screen and introduce two more buttons . 
UNKNOWN Just Uh where , L_C_ Okay w we now we can just uh Yes . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So L_C_D_'s out , is speech rec out now ? 
UNKNOWN We've Yep . 
UNKNOWN The speech recognition is out . 
UNKNOWN Because of the budget , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN So are we basically back to the original one now , back to the first version ? 
UNKNOWN Which turns out to be on budget exactly , pretty much . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN With these new costings . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN So just look at forget that one and look at that one now . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN I th I th I think w we just go for this one and that that now twelve Euros is the is is the price , okay . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN My m my supervisor will be glad that it's fifty cents cheaper than he expected . 
UNKNOWN Well that's that's Yep . 
UNKNOWN Actually yeah , we we we will not need the really uh expert designers um because the amount , yeah . 
UNKNOWN So . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So w we can go back and l talk to the suppliers maybe and see if we can drive the prices down to add a few more things in but that's all we can do with the restrictions we have at the moment . 
UNKNOWN Okay , good . 
UNKNOWN Then we the same . 
THANKS Thank you . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN That was it . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN That's it . 
CONFIRMATION Thanks . 
CONFIRMATION Cool . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN How do you wear this thing ? 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Mm mm mm . 
UNKNOWN Not too many cables and stuff . 
UNKNOWN Original . 
UNKNOWN Is recorded ? 
UNKNOWN Okay ? 
UNKNOWN Okay so welcome everyone . 
UNKNOWN So we are here for the kickoff meeting of uh the process of designing a new remote control . 
UNKNOWN So I will first start with a warm welcome opening stuff , then uh we will uh see what will be uh our product and what will be the different step we will have to design it . 
UNKNOWN And uh then we will uh discuss if we have few ideas and we will uh end uh by uh dispatching the different task you will be you will have to fulfil to complete this process . 
UNKNOWN So sorry ? 
CONFUSION Uh . 
UNKNOWN Just one thing . 
UNKNOWN Uh , you said twenty-five minutes , but I have something else to do uh , so gotta have another meeting uh soon , so maybe you could hurry up a bit It's true . 
UNKNOWN I have another meeting so if you could uh Yeah . 
UNKNOWN You have another meeting soon ? 
UNKNOWN So you have to be quick . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , for the lawnmower project . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So the the goal is to have a remote control so to have an advantage over our competitors we have to be original , we have to be trendy and we have to also try to be user-friendly . 
UNKNOWN So uh the design step will be divided in three uh main points . 
UNKNOWN First it will be the functional design . 
UNKNOWN Third is the conceptual design and then is the desired design . 
UNKNOWN So the functional design is to identify the main user needs , the technical function the remote control should fulfil . 
UNKNOWN And then we will move to f conceptual design where we'll specify the different component involved , what kind of user interf interface we want and what are the different uh trend in user interface and stuff like that . 
UNKNOWN And then the desired devi design will consist in uh specifically implementing and detailing the choice we've uh made in the second point . 
UNKNOWN So I will now ask you which is very important for the design of a new remote control for to uh each of us to to drawuh your favourite animal on the white board . 
UNKNOWN What an original idea . 
UNKNOWN Do you have any idea of which animal you want to show us ? 
UNKNOWN Orangutan . 
UNKNOWN Okay that's good . 
UNKNOWN No no n You should write y the name I think . 
UNKNOWN n n You should If you want to react uh about this wonderful drawinguh I'll let you uh comment . 
UNKNOWN Can I give you the no ? 
UNKNOWN But I don't have to say anything . 
UNKNOWN When I'm drawingthe orangutan . 
UNKNOWN It's an abstract drawingof an orangutan . 
UNKNOWN Okay it's an abstract drawing. 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN I think it's nice and original . 
UNKNOWN I don't have a red colour . 
UNKNOWN Usually orangutans have red hair so this is a very important but I don't have red pen , so Yes . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN You want to drawsomething Christine ? 
UNKNOWN Okay uh sorry . 
UNKNOWN You have to imagine a little bit um . 
UNKNOWN This Sorry too uh . 
UNKNOWN Of course your animal is recorded so it's not lost . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN I know . 
UNKNOWN Is this uh Ah okay it's pretty . 
UNKNOWN Wha what is this strange beast ? 
UNKNOWN Is it beautiful ? 
UNKNOWN Is it a monster ? 
UNKNOWN Do you know ? 
UNKNOWN It's a cat . 
UNKNOWN It's a cat ? 
UNKNOWN Isn't it ? 
UNKNOWN I thought these things did not exist . 
UNKNOWN Yes yes is it like that . 
UNKNOWN Me Ah yeah . 
UNKNOWN Is it better ? 
UNKNOWN Ah yeah Does have a name ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN It's my cat . 
UNKNOWN Okay it's your cat . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN The name is Caramel . 
UNKNOWN Caramel . 
UNKNOWN Caramel . 
UNKNOWN Ah-ha . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Olivier , do you want to Okay I go , but next time you'll do something I'm sure . 
UNKNOWN And you I think I'm too short for the cables . 
UNKNOWN Next time I concentrate . 
UNKNOWN I'm a bit short on cable . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So what could I draw? 
UNKNOWN Maybe I can drawlike a very simplified cow . 
UNKNOWN I don't know if it looks like a cow Like a what ? 
UNKNOWN He looks like a bong . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Sorry . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN Quite squarey . 
UNKNOWN Scary ? 
UNKNOWN He also . 
UNKNOWN I dunno it it looks more like a donkey in fact I would say . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN I I think we will be finished this uh Is it for uh for putting a for logos , no . 
UNKNOWN Okay so I hope that it helps you uh in the process of designing a remote control . 
UNKNOWN That's I is there a matter for a new remote control ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Let's move on . 
UNKNOWN So Here the uh financial objective of our project . 
UNKNOWN That is to say to to have a production cost lower than twelve point five Euros and have a selling price of twice that price t in order to target a profe profit of uh fifty uh million Euros . 
UNKNOWN Yeah if it's trendy , original I d fulfil the user needs . 
UNKNOWN Is it uh a single device remote control or is it a multi-device remote control ? 
UNKNOWN We have to discuss that point . 
UNKNOWN Ah this is not defined at all ? 
UNKNOWN On yeah you you can suggest points like this . 
UNKNOWN Ah , okay . 
UNKNOWN So what what so we have to decide for example if it can control one device or multiple . 
UNKNOWN So what's what are your ideas about that ? 
UNKNOWN Maybe I can have the your opinion from the marketing side ? 
UNKNOWN Well uh do we sell other stuff ? 
UNKNOWN Uh if if we bundle the remote control with something uh to sell then it could be a single device , otherwise it could be programmable one otherwise who would buy a remote control from us . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so if it selled uh by its own i it it would rather be for multiple device . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Do you agree ? 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So maybe it should be for multiple devices . 
UNKNOWN And uh do you have any ideas um of uh design ideas or any uh uh technical requirement we we should uh fulfil ? 
UNKNOWN I think we shouldn't have too many b for my part . 
UNKNOWN No , I couldn I cannot fi think of any requirements right now . 
UNKNOWN I think If we don't have so many buttons could be nice . 
UNKNOWN Few buttons . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN And do you have it also to be to be lighted in order to be used in the dark ? 
UNKNOWN Might be a good idea . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN And do you have any um any uh idea of the trend the trend in domain , what it shouldn't it should look like , or things like that ? 
UNKNOWN Something which is not squarey maybe uh , not a box . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN With rou okay . 
UNKNOWN Like for okay . 
UNKNOWN Something like that , least fits in your hand . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN The basic requirement . 
UNKNOWN So . 
UNKNOWN Fit in your hand , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Only a buck . 
UNKNOWN And also it have , i it may be it may be important for the remote control to be uh To , to resist to various shocks that can happen if it fall . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Waterproof . 
UNKNOWN Water-proof as well . 
UNKNOWN And I think we should have a device Sorry . 
UNKNOWN Maybe it is original because you can uh use it in your uh in your bath whereas the others can't . 
UNKNOWN Maybe water-proof would be very original . 
UNKNOWN Havin having a water-proof remote control so that the people can uh use it in their bath . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN That could be uh Yeah but , it is still something uh you have to buy and that is um not maybe very Yeah , mayb B But maybe we can bulk it with uh already this plastic thing and uh the waterproof uh stuff as well . 
UNKNOWN B it seems uh so , but uh if you don't have an waterproof remote control it means you can just cover it with some plastic and you can sort of f And , and that's one of the that's one of the shock I mean there are people that have a remote control and they are worried that it's going to break and they put some extra plastic around it . 
UNKNOWN That's people they actually do it themselves . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN directly . 
UNKNOWN I it will look a bulky in that case . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Maybe we can sell uh all that together , so so plastic protection and uh and a waterproof box as well . 
UNKNOWN That might be good uh track to follow . 
UNKNOWN Like as an optional thing . 
UNKNOWN Optional or selled with it ? 
UNKNOWN And I I think we should have something , most of the time I I lose my remote control . 
UNKNOWN We should have s uh special bu button on the T_V_ to make the remote control beeping . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Maybe we can have uh But we don't design the T_V_ . 
UNKNOWN Ah yeah . 
UNKNOWN Maybe we can have uh something you whistle and uh the remote control uh beep . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Barks . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , barks , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Barks . 
UNKNOWN So we can uh have a whistle uh remote control ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah whistle . 
UNKNOWN I don't know , whistle-able ? 
UNKNOWN Whistle tracking . 
UNKNOWN Th Whistle tracking yeah . 
UNKNOWN Whistle tracking remote control . 
UNKNOWN That's a good idea , that's very original and that's can uh improve . 
UNKNOWN That's that's quite cool , but uh of course we you don't normally need uh any audio uh recording stuff on your remote control right ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah d d uh . 
UNKNOWN So i it's just going to add t to the cost . 
UNKNOWN Yeah but s still we have to mm we have to have an advantage over our competitors . 
UNKNOWN I think this is a good advantage . 
UNKNOWN It's cool . 
UNKNOWN I think I like the idea , but I'm not sure about the what you , who is giving who's giving who's giving our budget . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN We have to ask Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Who's Yeah . 
UNKNOWN We have to ask the quest of that's uh design to the uh Industrial um Designer . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Which is you . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN yeah Okay . 
UNKNOWN Okay so try to find that for next meeting . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So next meeting is in thirty minutes or so uh . 
UNKNOWN Don't panic . 
UNKNOWN Don't pani . 
UNKNOWN So so I will ask the Industrial Designer to find out more about this industrial design so any working any working function we have discussed . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So then I will ask the User Interf Interface Designer to to think about the point we discussed like the number of buttons , the the fact that is lighted or not , things like that , and what would be convenient for the user . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN And also um I will ask the Market Expert to uh try to find out what are the absolute requirements , what is absolutely needed in a remote control uh for the user . 
UNKNOWN So . 
UNKNOWN And then uh I will uh just ask you to think about that and uh look at your mailbecause you will receive uh some good advice soon . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN So . 
THANKS Thank you I think that's all for this point . 
UNKNOWN Good . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
THANKS Thank you 
UNKNOWN Uh , so we come back in five minutes ? 
UNKNOWN Half an hour . 
UNKNOWN Anyway you will receive some messages . 
UNKNOWN Be careful . 
UNKNOWN You eat it ? 
UNKNOWN Does it move uh ? 
UNKNOWN Okay , but I don't know if it uh is still correctly uh We'll see . 
UNKNOWN Ah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
GREETING Hello . 
UNKNOWN So we are here for uh for uh functional design . 
UNKNOWN Okay ? 
UNKNOWN So we are here for the functional design meeting mm so first I will show the agendaso we will uh I will take notesduring this meeting so I will try to summarise it and put that summary in the shared folder if you want to look at it afterwards so then uh each of you will uh lead a presentationon the task that has been required last time so user requirement specification , technical function design and working design . 
UNKNOWN Then I will uh present you some new project requirements I received from uh the management board . 
UNKNOWN Then we will take uh the decision on on the remote control uh needed functions and then I will assign you the task for the next part of the meeting . 
UNKNOWN Of the of the process . 
UNKNOWN So uh who want to start the the presentationof what they did ? 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN F do you want to start ? 
UNKNOWN Make a start yeah . 
UNKNOWN You can start . 
UNKNOWN So . 
UNKNOWN Cable , camera . 
UNKNOWN You have uh PowerPoint? 
UNKNOWN Should be in my in their folder no ? 
UNKNOWN Ah yeah maybe there . 
UNKNOWN Up . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Who are you ? 
UNKNOWN Um at three I think . 
UNKNOWN No ? 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Ouch . 
UNKNOWN And We have a technical problem uh . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Do we think w s in the in the wrong folder maybe ? 
UNKNOWN It is possible . 
UNKNOWN You put it on Yeah . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN It was somewhere in something like this . 
UNKNOWN I don't remember the name actually must be something like messenger AMI or something . 
UNKNOWN What do you have in short cut ? 
UNKNOWN Go up . 
UNKNOWN Participant two . 
UNKNOWN Yeah go up . 
UNKNOWN Again . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN Go back . 
UNKNOWN You have no Over . 
UNKNOWN Uh maybe messenger AMI . 
UNKNOWN Messenger . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN There is nothing . 
UNKNOWN There's no We have a technical problem . 
UNKNOWN Let's go and check . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I'll go and check . 
UNKNOWN Otherwise , could you just describe by hand ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN With the the whiteboard ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN If you remember yeah but that's Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So uh . 
UNKNOWN Basically what we want here is a remote control right . 
UNKNOWN So um the question well first of all what to control . 
UNKNOWN So most people want to have a a remote for their hi-fi and T_V_ and stuff like that . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN And but other people want th also remotes for controlling uh and toys like robotic pets and little robots and stuff and other people also want to have remotes for controlling um whole house . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , so there's a project I think called X_ house or something like that that does that , uh you can integrate your remote with uh computers stuff . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So there is one that is one thing . 
UNKNOWN The other is the the finder feature yeah by whistling or whatever . 
UNKNOWN Uh if you have the finder feature then you can also have uh at the same time as and general voice commands if you want yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So I think it should be a package in that case . 
UNKNOWN Uh so the user interface will consist of two parts . 
UNKNOWN One is the voice command part and on one is the actual buttons part . 
UNKNOWN Uh and th the buttons part would be uh a set of buttons for choosing devices , a set of buttons for special navigation in space , a set of buttons for linear access of medium and a set of buttons for random access . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah ? 
UNKNOWN What do you mean by linear access then ? 
UNKNOWN Like a video tape goes forward , backwards , uh fast and stuff yeah . 
UNKNOWN Ah . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Okay so special navigation , linear access , random access and there's a fourth one no ? 
UNKNOWN Mm ? 
UNKNOWN So the better now for special navigation ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN For special navigation for example you might have a T_V_ in the menu and you going to change yeah ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Then linear access then random access . 
CONFUSION Uh . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah and also parameter changing . 
UNKNOWN Ah yeah parameter okay . 
UNKNOWN So if there are common parameters maybe we should put special buttons for that um or maybe we could have everything uh generic but uh there are a lot of uh remotes on the market right now and basically this is most of the almost everybody has this stuff . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Okay and and voice command did you uh Okay . 
UNKNOWN Voice command w we could specify anything . 
UNKNOWN We could assign any button a command to any button , if we have enough processing power , I guess so . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So that's uh that close your investigations ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh yeah I think so . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Not so far . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Maybe we can have a look at the user requirements with I dunno if I can open it . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um I dunno if you can open the uh m is not here . 
UNKNOWN Maybe you can s It's Messenger no ? 
UNKNOWN Uh in yeah okay . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN In document. 
UNKNOWN Mm computer yeah . 
UNKNOWN In which folder ? 
UNKNOWN Where did you put it ? 
UNKNOWN Here . 
UNKNOWN Here . 
UNKNOWN Short-cut to AMI shared folder ? 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN But it's not Um . 
UNKNOWN Maybe you can send it to me by email. 
UNKNOWN Just to participant one . 
UNKNOWN At AMI . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I can do that . 
UNKNOWN I will try to show it to everyone , that would be more comfortable . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN You send it ? 
UNKNOWN It's participant one ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh this is this email. 
UNKNOWN I'm designing the user interface . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN You can uh . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So maybe I can switch slideswhen you whenever you ask , that will be more convenient . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So okay , functional requirements . 
UNKNOWN Okay so you can you can go . 
UNKNOWN Okay so in our usability lab we observed the remote control use among one hundred subjects and the subjects also filled a questionnaire okay ? 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And here I have the results so you can see that um seventy five per cent of users find most remote controls ugly so we have to find something to make them more more nice , more kind . 
UNKNOWN Eighty per cents of users would spend more money when the remote control would look fancy . 
UNKNOWN Eighty hundred per cent of users would spend more money when the remote control would look oh to it's not good . 
UNKNOWN So okay . 
UNKNOWN So it's not in theory but I I can I can say yeah . 
UNKNOWN We can just keep doing that ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Fifty f uh seventy five per cent of users say they s zap a lot . 
UNKNOWN So mm we have to have a remote control uh very um out for that . 
UNKNOWN Uh the buttons have are to be um uh uh like you say resist resisting to to shocks . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um and fifty per cents of users say they only use uh ten per cents of but of the buttons in the in the remote control . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So all the buttons we we have to put are have to to have um a use a real use and not only or Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so fewer buttons maybe would be good ? 
UNKNOWN F not many buttons , and uh and uh uh u useable buttons . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN But what kind of remote controls did you look at ? 
CONFUSION Sorry ? 
UNKNOWN What kind of task was it ? 
UNKNOWN It was a T_V_ ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh most for most is T_V_ . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah but in fact we it it seems that we are going to make a T_V_ remote control according to new requirements I received from the management bo I will present them in the following . 
UNKNOWN Huh . 
UNKNOWN Uh-huh . 
UNKNOWN Ah ! 
UNKNOWN Good . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN 'Kay you can go so . 
UNKNOWN So there are other frustrations expressed by users , so they said uh they lost uh often the remote control in in the room so they want to have a way to to to find it . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN To find it . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um and um lot of the time they it takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote control . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So they want something s really very simple and uh easy to use . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN And uh remote controls are bad for R_S_I_ um I dunno . 
UNKNOWN What is her other side ? 
UNKNOWN Other side yeah , yo wa your wrist . 
UNKNOWN It i can become painful you can have tendonditis . 
UNKNOWN Oh yeah ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I did not knew that . 
UNKNOWN If you also up on a computer in a strange position . 
UNKNOWN Okay so you we have to make it uh more ergonomic yeah . 
UNKNOWN Ergonomic . 
UNKNOWN But uh . 
UNKNOWN Have to say ha ha . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It's your job Oh . 
CONFUSION Uh . 
UNKNOWN Uh sorry got a message from Microsoft . 
UNKNOWN Okay um before that I I have some some some thing uh to say before um We know that uh the user use uh a lot their um remote control um to to change channel . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um and um to to change uh volume selection of the and uh and not uh a lot for setting for setting the the channels and uh thing things like that . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So it's better to put uh uh uh something very easy to set and uh and Very accessible yes . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN This function should be very uh accessible . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , okay . 
UNKNOWN That's right . 
UNKNOWN This is the main function okay . 
UNKNOWN So then we asked some questions to them and um we asked this question if they prefer an L_C_D_ screen or on their remultific function remotes control and if they mm pay more for speech recognition in remote control and you can go we have here the results of of the questions . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN The first question . 
UNKNOWN So you know that um for the younger it's very important to have the s yes and speech recognition . 
UNKNOWN To have L_C_D_ and voice . 
UNKNOWN And uh and the others is not so important but uh we know that uh uh people between fifteen and twenty five are people who watch a lot T_V_ and uh who who wh can use a lot this uh . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So maybe we we can have a speech recognition in . 
UNKNOWN Yeah maybe this this is important . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Moreover th maybe those uh like those teenager customer could advice their parents to buy this equipment and so we can we have to take care of that point of view I think or so . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay and if there is th the conclusion now . 
UNKNOWN So as we say before , I think uh um a remote control lightening in the dark it's it's a good thing . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Uh not to many mud buttons like we we said before , e easy to use uh a way to find it easily in the room and uh uh resistant to to shock and to to An I s no , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Okay these are the user requi Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I dunno if you see something else important or Mm . 
UNKNOWN I'm just thinking of some thing . 
UNKNOWN Um We want to have a no , I don't know if this is a good idea . 
UNKNOWN We want to have a a general remote control for everything . 
UNKNOWN No no no . 
UNKNOWN We w it seems that we no want to have a T_V_ remote control . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN From the management board I receive an email. 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Cos it would be costly uh and and also it it would take more time to develop to have a a general generic remote control . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Mm I it's not true I think . 
UNKNOWN The the second claim that you put . 
UNKNOWN No no . 
UNKNOWN That it would be too long to develop . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think that should be the same . 
UNKNOWN Oh yeah . 
UNKNOWN Because I received that emailfrom management board and they seems to tell that that if we want to be on the market as early as possible we should uh focus on T_V_ more where it seems that the market is more important . 
UNKNOWN So maybe it's a good decision . 
UNKNOWN I dunno . 
UNKNOWN What's your opinion ? 
UNKNOWN I have uh I've no idea I mean I should know a bit more about how fast we can uh design it . 
UNKNOWN I don't think Uh yeah . 
UNKNOWN Finish tonight . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN But basically yeah maybe I can continue with my presentation, it would be al you you but I think we have some technical problem or so . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So I'm just going to describe briefly what we do in the remote control . 
UNKNOWN Maybe you can go to the whiteboard if you have some drawings to do I don't know . 
UNKNOWN If fact Yeah but Do I have oh yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Now I have enough cables . 
UNKNOWN Like a you feel a bit like a dog with this stuff . 
UNKNOWN Okay so I'm just going to describe in fact for for a remote control this is quite easy . 
UNKNOWN We just have sorry , I'm going Like that . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Are you okay ? 
UNKNOWN I'm just going to describe . 
UNKNOWN Basically we have a a battery a power supply here . 
UNKNOWN After that we just have um user interface . 
UNKNOWN Let's say that um something like that , which could be um a L_C_D_ let's say or um an array of push button , something like that . 
UNKNOWN Push button or a L_C_D_ . 
UNKNOWN After that we we feed that into um uh an electronic chip . 
UNKNOWN So I say U_C_ and I feed that to uh L_E_D_ which is uh infrared um which is a an infrared um component . 
UNKNOWN And so what we for for myself this for for us this is quite easy . 
UNKNOWN U_C_ is the central unit ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay yeah . 
UNKNOWN Y it's a it's this just a chip which does all the um numerical numerical computation according to your display . 
UNKNOWN Computation . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN And so for us uh this is quite easy . 
UNKNOWN We just need to take to define what we want to do when the user interface um wants something and after that we just do the coding to s and send that to to to the not the to the television . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So for us this is quite easy . 
UNKNOWN Okay so this is quite easy . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um we just have to define the processing power that we need uh especially if we want to do some uh speech recognition , in that case that mean that we are going to use more for simple Yeah of course of course . 
UNKNOWN There is not that much constraints . 
UNKNOWN This will think this will take more time to develop also . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And um but for a standard one this is really easy . 
UNKNOWN It's a question of one month and so on s No no no no , I say yeah standard uh standard remote control takes maybe uh one month to to do that . 
UNKNOWN Soon . 
UNKNOWN To have a you s you speak about with voi voice control ? 
UNKNOWN Standard button one . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So the only time problem is the sp voice recognition . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Definitely . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So do you have any idea of how long it would take to have voice recognition now ? 
UNKNOWN I would say . 
UNKNOWN Ten years . 
UNKNOWN I would say uh about eight months to have the first results . 
UNKNOWN Okay so i it's a bit long yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I can Um . 
UNKNOWN One month for the standard one with button . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Even if we have a L_C_D_ display ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah even . 
UNKNOWN I mean that this is really standard devices now . 
UNKNOWN Um eight . 
UNKNOWN For uh speech recognition . 
UNKNOWN Okay yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay so we can take this into account . 
UNKNOWN So who think it would be good to go for uh like speech recognition ? 
UNKNOWN But we don't have time to market . 
UNKNOWN And also how much uh I think during the kickoff meeting you say that we we shouldn't we shouldn't go up to twelve point five Euro per unit so how many units should we sell to have a Yeah but how many yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah it will . 
UNKNOWN I think we should contact management . 
UNKNOWN Euros . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well . 
UNKNOWN Well each unit is is sell uh twenty five Euros . 
UNKNOWN Uh How muc how much do you get how much do you if you buy one million units h no , one hundred thousand units . 
UNKNOWN Eh chips . 
UNKNOWN We're gonna need chips right . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN How much will it cost for one hundred thousand ? 
UNKNOWN Usually this is less tha at two dollars per chip . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Because we are It seems that that we want to sell like four million units from the first meeting . 
UNKNOWN So you have any idea for a powerful one that has uh good enough for do speech recognition . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , we can Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So . 
UNKNOWN No it doesn't . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Four million . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Maybe we can uh we can look at the new requirement I receive from the management board and discus discuss all function we want to have . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Um I just had a question uh do you want to continue with your presenta ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah I I will continue . 
UNKNOWN Is it Um you say that I don't remember by heart but thirty per cent of the tested people say that's it's quite difficult to to to use the remote control . 
UNKNOWN Well ask your question if you want . 
UNKNOWN Mm ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Do they say that this is difficult but for the same reason or do they have other reason ? 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN To to maybe to keep in mind maybe to access to that menu you should do something like that . 
UNKNOWN Would j Uh yeah w I I think they they say that it's uh difficult to learn how to use it but i when you know how to use it , it's it's okay . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN And But yeah maybe and what about if we design a remote control which can be configure as you want ? 
UNKNOWN But Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It's not intuitive first . 
UNKNOWN You say that I want , I have six button Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Mh-hmm . 
UNKNOWN A a lot of people are uh if you have the L_C_D_ screen if you can do it completely the way you want because the buttons also look the way you want them but it will be hard to configure I mean imagine i uh so it's really something for the expert user . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But , but also it seems that Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So I mean there are markets and markets . 
UNKNOWN I think the young people are th uh are uh Christine here said uh you have a uh it is yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So for our young people uh it will be cool , they can be able to use it . 
UNKNOWN Th maybe their parents will not but they will configure it . 
UNKNOWN I guess . 
UNKNOWN I don't know if there is study about that . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Maybe it would be more complex to configure it to be simple than creating a simple product . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN And there are another thing is that if we make something that's simple and easy to use that's bas to use immediately that means that it will be exactly the same as everything else . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN All right ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Otherwise , if it's different then of course everybody has somebody has to learn to use it first . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But also we we see that that most people find it find remote controls too complex because they have too many buttons and they mainly use only channels and volume buttons . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So we may just uh make a very easy to use remote control with mainly those buttons and maybe also um some lightning stuff too because most people find also hard to to find the remote control . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Losed lose it etcetera . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN These these are these two points are the main frustrations so maybe if we design something very simple and easy to uh find when lost it will uh add uh a serious competitive advantage without making something too complex and too long to develop . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So but le let us see first the new requirement . 
UNKNOWN So we don't have to so this this uh is uh is um in the this is in the same direction as we were speaking so we don't have to make a very complex remote controls to access teletext and stuff like that Yeah but then you have to you have to define the buttons to surf amongst pagesand stuff . 
UNKNOWN But teletext is just one button . 
UNKNOWN You you just write the write the numbers . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So well Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So will you add with the channel keys , right ? 
UNKNOWN So . 
UNKNOWN So anyway we don't have to include this feature because it's it's not used any more by users , they prefer to s Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I am . 
UNKNOWN I'm sure that uh it don't like but uh I don't see just one button . 
UNKNOWN So . 
UNKNOWN I dunno . 
UNKNOWN If i one button is still one more button . 
UNKNOWN If if if we want to make it very simple we have to reduce number of buttons compared to th to our competitors . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Well anyway I have this point . 
UNKNOWN We can discuss . 
UNKNOWN Also um so as as I told before uh it would be better if it's only for the T_V_ um because we want to be quick on on the market . 
UNKNOWN And then also we have to make very uh uh clear that this uh this remote control is is part of of our products and show our corporate uh logo and and colours on the on the design as well so that uh they identify it as one of our product . 
UNKNOWN So this is the the key point . 
UNKNOWN So before uh finishing we can uh define uh what would be the characteristic of the o th of the control of the remote control and which button do we need which function do we want etcetera . 
UNKNOWN Capital . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN So do you um so so from from the the Marketing Expert I think a key aspect is the easy to use aspect , it should be very simple and most button are never used only ten per cent of the button are are used often so I think we have to do something very simple and I think we all agree on that point , no ? 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Well if it is going to be just a T_V_ remote control it is going to be very simple . 
UNKNOWN Yeah okay . 
UNKNOWN So yeah the key point here is simple . 
CONFUSION Maybe . 
UNKNOWN So few buttons , channel , volume control and what el what function do you see in addition to that ? 
UNKNOWN Well if it's going to be as simple as possible then just have the remote control , there is no other function that I can see really . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Maybe switch T_V_ on and off Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh no you want to keep television on so that the advertising can revenue can come back to us . 
UNKNOWN Or something . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Volume , maybe a mute button , and then on off button . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN And that's all ? 
UNKNOWN Uh I know that som you say that many people are doing plenty of a lot of zapping . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN I know tha I discovered that when I did a quick look , uh they do now som they do something which is quite nice now , you have a button , you you press it , and this is uh the previous channel which has come back . 
UNKNOWN It's a memory , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah this is cool . 
UNKNOWN Maybe we can include that also . 
UNKNOWN Previous previous channel button . 
UNKNOWN So we have like channel button , the previous channel button , the volume button , plus a mute button , and uh just the the traditional on off button . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN And uh and of course the channel changing buttons . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I I talk about that , yeah ? 
UNKNOWN How should they how should we implement that ? 
UNKNOWN Because uh could be numerical only or could be also incremental . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Incremental definitely because zapping you you switch them . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Let's say that we can do something like that . 
UNKNOWN This is uh incremental , but once you press it for a long time , you go five by five . 
UNKNOWN We go faster ? 
UNKNOWN To go fa to go faster . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN It's an interesting idea , that if you press it for a long time it does something else , in general . 
UNKNOWN So if you you have your ten buttons for the for the numeric the numerical buttons and you have instead of having just one memory you have if you press them for a long time No . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Doesn't work does it . 
UNKNOWN Maybe we should have also a digit button Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Maybe we should have a complete keyboard and just type console commands . 
UNKNOWN Change channel to eight . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN Maybe we have also to have digits or only incremental . 
UNKNOWN I dunno bec because if you have the Uh . 
UNKNOWN Well if it's useful like if if you want to change between three channels for example then you h you cannot you cannot cannot work with just memory being incremental . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Because you have your previous channel button if you have incremental only it's not uh it isn't worth it because the previous channel is eith either minus one or plus one . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So I think we need also digits . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Maybe we we can make very obvious the channel and volume button button and smaller button down there with the the digits . 
UNKNOWN Yeah when you zap usually you will have to press the same button all the time and Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Or we can do something like that . 
UNKNOWN We can design the remote control to have access . 
UNKNOWN You know some remote control have uh protection and so you you y You Yeah , a kind of joystick . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Hey I just thought this thing there is a I mean you know there is are some with a wheel like this . 
UNKNOWN Instead of having the up down buttons for uh you can have the wheel . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Maybe we can have a wheel for incremental . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So have a wheel for incremental , have the digits uh on the lower side that can be closed so as you say protected , and uh yeah I think this is the basi And do we do we have a No , a wheel is better . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN On the lower side I think it you have to turn it . 
UNKNOWN No ? 
UNKNOWN If we do that . 
UNKNOWN Or a or a ball , yeah , not a a wheel but a ball , and you say uh to Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I would say the wheel is better . 
UNKNOWN Because of that Because it's uh it's it's not like a volume which is smooth yeah ? 
UNKNOWN What is the expert of uh Okay . 
UNKNOWN The channels change one by one . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So you have to the user has to like to should feel the the the discrete sense a bit . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , the yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN That's a good idea . 
UNKNOWN Well also we have to decide uh so it should be lightening in the dark I think because most people lost their remote control . 
UNKNOWN 'S quite it's quite easy we do that w with back light on the on the wheel . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Even if i L_E_D_ uh or a if if it's the L_C_D_ feature uh whatever , yeah . 
UNKNOWN A blue a blue L_E_D_ and we sell that um . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , and do we put an L_C_D_ display ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Because it was important for young customers if you remember . 
UNKNOWN I think it's only put on if cou have multi function . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN If you do not multi function then there is no p point in having L_C_D_ . 
UNKNOWN Just increase the cost . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN The user does not have an advantage really . 
UNKNOWN So no L_C_D_ ? 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN And so no speech as well because it w it would delay too much the development process . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Well if it's going to delay yeah but uh it will be cool . 
UNKNOWN It would . 
UNKNOWN Because a user could say C_N_N_ for example and it would go C_N_N_ . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN That would be cool . 
UNKNOWN But eight months is really long and Maybe we can just uh Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Ten years Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So um I I will uh I will so I we will move to next meeting so in after the lunch break uh here are the individual uh action uh you are required to do but you will be uh recalled to the actions by uh emailI think but you can take notesif you if you want but well the instruction will be sent . 
UNKNOWN So thank you for uh your suggestion and I I will make a summary of that meeting that I will put in the shared folder you can't see and uh and then you will um you will be able to to see what has been uh has been said on on this meeting and and what has been decided . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Uh maybe for next meeting uh send me your presentationbefore by emailso that we can see them uh altogether . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN That would be easier . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN What is the folder that you put yours in ? 
UNKNOWN And did it it did work ? 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN No it did not work . 
UNKNOWN No no . 
UNKNOWN She send it to me by email. 
UNKNOWN Ah yeah . 
UNKNOWN I dunno , I dunno it . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So maybe this is better , to send it by email. 
UNKNOWN Okay what is your email? 
UNKNOWN Okay ? 
UNKNOWN So yeah I I'm it's in the first uh emailso I'm participant one at AMI uh where is that , it's here . 
UNKNOWN At participant one . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Participant one at AMI . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So see you after lunch break . 
UNKNOWN 'Kay thank you . 
UNKNOWN Well during lunch break actually . 
UNKNOWN So next time we should have a fight . 
UNKNOWN How about uh management or something . 
UNKNOWN Who happens to be your friend . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So we are here for the concept design meeting . 
UNKNOWN So , we will first start by summarizing the mm the previous meeting and the decision we've taken . 
UNKNOWN Uh I will take notesduring this meeting so uh that you can uh look at my uh folder to see the summary of this meeting afterwards . 
UNKNOWN So each of you will uh show us the various investigation they've done during uh previous uh hours . 
UNKNOWN We'll then t take decision in concert and then uh uh we will uh define the nest next task , to have to be done before the next meeting . 
UNKNOWN So , last time we decided to have a simple interface . 
UNKNOWN We also decided to have a wheel to change channel previous channel button . 
UNKNOWN Channel digit uh buttons should be uh protected by plastic cover or something for the remote control to look very simple . 
UNKNOWN We have also button for volume , and to switch on off the T_V_ . 
UNKNOWN We have also uh the lightening feature for the remote control to be easy to find , and for fast development and low cost we have decided to have no L_C_D_ no voice features . 
UNKNOWN So now uh we will have three presentations. 
UNKNOWN So the conceptual specification by Industrial Designer , the specification of the U_I_ by or U_I_ okay . 
UNKNOWN Abdul al-Hasred is my name . 
UNKNOWN And uh the last point is uh trend watching by Market Expert . 
UNKNOWN So maybe we can start with uh industrial design . 
UNKNOWN So this is the presentation. 
UNKNOWN Uh , I_D_ you want ? 
UNKNOWN Maybe I can switch slideuh on your request . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I only v have three slides, so . 
UNKNOWN I just look at the mm um just this . 
UNKNOWN On some web pagesto find some documentationand I think a remote control is , as I s mentioned previously , you just have a a very simple chip and the mm the user interface is just done usually by push button and in our case we are using a um a wheel control . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So uh uh I was looking basically for that chip , which is uh very very standard , and uh I just looked for the wheel sensor and the standard push button . 
UNKNOWN And um yeah we can change directly . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN In fact I have the number of that element which is very standard for remote control . 
UNKNOWN The push button are usually extremely cheap , but I just have one problem and this is related with the wheel sensor , which seems to be quite expensive . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN And I think we if we could just talk about that if we really need a wheel sensor or if we can not if if we could combine something with the push button . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Uh a wheel sensor is fifty time the price of a a a push button . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But is it a significant price on the whole remote control ? 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Because we can afford up to twelve Euros for the price of the remote control . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah I I th But I don't think that uh we should We should talk about uh the design of the box also which needs some money . 
UNKNOWN So will will will this with uh including all possible things , so buttons , wheel and the chip , be uh lower than twelve Euros to produce ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay You received something Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Also have to say Did you receive the emailabout the voice recognition ? 
UNKNOWN But Um that's all yeah . 
UNKNOWN No ? 
UNKNOWN I haven't chec Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN You we uh an emailfrom the manufacturing division that they have basically a voice recognition chip already developed . 
UNKNOWN Says Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It says that ri right now they just use it to uh to record uh answers to particular questions . 
UNKNOWN But I guess it could be I guess it's possible . 
UNKNOWN And could it be adapted ? 
UNKNOWN I mean instead of recording the answers you can just uh record uh something simpler like a command . 
UNKNOWN Okay and there can uh recognize some commands and stuff ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah you reco recognize commands and you can record new commands and stuff , so if they already have it as uh as a chip then we we could use it . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay maybe we can just uh listen to this presentationand then take decision later on according to those news . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah but I think it's yeah Sorry , I haven't written my personal references . 
UNKNOWN Um the I I just want to mention the the problem of the the r wheels sensor which is much more expensive than any push button , and if we could reduce that . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN We we have already some good things uh with um um with the backlight of the push button . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN I have a question about that actually . 
UNKNOWN Um , what is the purpose of the light ? 
UNKNOWN Just to to make something which is uh slightly more design that uh a squarey box with a rubber Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Is But But in th in the dark uh Yeah but is going to be always turned on , the light ? 
UNKNOWN You can easily find the button in the dark or so ? 
UNKNOWN It will be turned on when the when the user move the remote control I think , no ? 
UNKNOWN But if you move it then you have it , you don't need to find it . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN You can see the buttons better , of course . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN True . 
UNKNOWN Actually . 
UNKNOWN But if you move it then you have to have some sensor to when you move it to detect your movement . 
UNKNOWN As soon as you thought to move the the remote control you have the light . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but you need another sensor for that , right ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Again . 
UNKNOWN Yeah no it's too expensive . 
UNKNOWN I don't think that this is really expensive , but at the end this is plenty of unexpen eh very cheap devices but uh the bill starts to be First of all I was thinking to have a a continuous light and you w when t you you you you press the on button you have the light on your remote control , when you want to turn off your device Yeah , a little bit . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Extra . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , okay . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but I expected also the wheel would be cheap but you tell me that it is very expensive so , yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN But it can be uh battery consuming , no ? 
UNKNOWN To have the light always on ? 
UNKNOWN A little bit . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Well we will discuss that after maybe the other presentations. 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So uh my one , it uh should be in the shared folder . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So . 
UNKNOWN It was last time I saw it . 
UNKNOWN And it is . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So , just move to the next slide. 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So basically want very simple , right ? 
UNKNOWN That's the major idea , as simple as possible . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So I just look at some current designsuh on the web , of usually more complicated remote controls . 
UNKNOWN And let's look at two of them because uh th even though they have many buttons they look quite simple . 
UNKNOWN And in our case we just uh reject the buttons what we don't need and it become even simpler . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN So . 
UNKNOWN And also does it uh fit well in hand ? 
UNKNOWN Because it was uh th your wrist problem with the usage . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well this these uh these remotes are quite big , so go to the next page, so . 
UNKNOWN We have all these buttons as you can see , but most of them , we just need the ones in the middle . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So , from the bottom or whatever is there , uh the uh the numbers and then the top , uh until the ten also , this middle part , and on the left one is exactly the same . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So it's basically more or less how we would like it , with a big volume control , big channel control , and mute and power , yeah ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN These are the basic thing . 
UNKNOWN So it's only the central part . 
UNKNOWN So basically , w software we will build will look more or less the same as these two . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN With a maybe a more ergonomic design on on the bottom part . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , if you have , for example I think that the volume and the buttons that are there on the top are not very easy to reach with your thumb . 
UNKNOWN It could be on the right side , for example . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Because we don't have these input buttons and this other stuff that they have . 
UNKNOWN And I think that the plastic cover is not very good uh idea because you open it , it can break , you ca you can do various things . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Uh you just need to put the channel numbers somewhere a bit out of the way . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN S Okay . 
UNKNOWN So that they're separate a bit , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Will be down or Okay . 
UNKNOWN Uh and it's easy to press the other the big buttons , but uh , it's not that difficult to press the the channel buttons either . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I think that if you put the cover it will be even more difficult for the user . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Alright , you won't yeah . 
UNKNOWN Usually what I have noticed that people put the plastic cover on things that you normally don't mess with , like buttons for t uh tuning the channels and stuff like that . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN That you want to protect a bit . 
UNKNOWN And I think it's uh it's reasonable . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So , I don't think Yeah , this is just the the wheel . 
UNKNOWN We could use the some wheels can be pushed down , could use the push down of the wheel for the record if we want . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Uh so we could just basically use one just wheel and uh user could use just the wheel to do everything with the channels in that case . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Maybe the wheel will be a good advantage over our competitors . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Because otherwise it's pretty standard apart the fact that it's very simple . 
UNKNOWN So maybe it's worse to uh to have more expense on that's that aspect . 
UNKNOWN To s Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I guess the market researcher will tell us all about that . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So we can move to the Is there any question ? 
UNKNOWN For designer of user interface ? 
UNKNOWN or we can move to the next part , maybe , and discuss afterwards ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Okay , I can go ? 
UNKNOWN Can I ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So now the recent investigation we we have done fo of the remote control um . 
UNKNOWN So , the most important aspect for remote controls is to be fancy look and feel and not current functional look and feel . 
UNKNOWN And um the second aspect is uh that the remote control should be uh technological innovative . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN And the third most important aspect is to to is that the co remote control should be easy to use . 
UNKNOWN So , are things we are we have uh speak about before . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And um so you you can go after . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And there is a fashion watchers in Paris and Milan that have detected the following trends , uh fruits and vegetables will be the most important theme for clothes , shoes , and furnitures . 
UNKNOWN So , maybe if our remote control have to be a fruit form or vegetable form something like that , or And the mm the material is expected to be spongy . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN I support an apple . 
UNKNOWN Uh I don't know which material can be spongy , and if you Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN This is good also for Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well , wou wou I think we can certainly just put the electronics in a spongy thing , it it would work , right ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think it is good also f to have a spongy material , yeah . 
UNKNOWN You can throw it to the television . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , because it's robust . 
UNKNOWN Okay It's robust , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Me too . 
UNKNOWN Hey that's a cool one . 
UNKNOWN We could say that if you throw it , you have a sensor , and you throw it and hits the television and turns it off . 
UNKNOWN When it d uh takes a shock . 
UNKNOWN Yeah uh sorry ? 
UNKNOWN Ah it's okay . 
UNKNOWN Not good . 
UNKNOWN I know that they do that for alarm clock also . 
UNKNOWN An and and uh this uh you can yeah you can say that . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN You ca uh you can go uh before , before , yes . 
NEGATION No . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Before ? 
UNKNOWN And you know here the more iz important aspect is the fancy look and feel , after is uh technological innovative , and after the easy to use . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think it's innovative to use the mm the wheel because I think no one else has . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah that's why Yeah that's why I think we have to keep that if it's possible . 
UNKNOWN Has it ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think it's it makes it both easy and both innos innovative . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Innovative . 
UNKNOWN So I think it's a good aspect and it should be kept . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN How do we make it look cool is the question . 
UNKNOWN Cool , fancy ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN We have to make it l look like a fruit or vegetable . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Maybe uh um a colour that remember some fruit uh , things like that . 
UNKNOWN What about um And for maybe look and feel , what about a a piece of ice , with blue L_E_D_ inside ? 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Oh , colour , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well the obvious thing is a banana , I guess . 
UNKNOWN Oh i i I thought about a a pear , for example . 
UNKNOWN Maybe yeah . 
UNKNOWN You know the pear , is like that and it's it's easy to to have in in hand and uh Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , and it's ergonomic as well . 
UNKNOWN A pear . 
UNKNOWN The banana is also ergonomic . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Maybe pear yeah or something like that . 
UNKNOWN Or a fruit like that . 
UNKNOWN I dunno . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN We can discuss that uh . 
UNKNOWN D D Is is there anything you want to add ? 
UNKNOWN Is there any fruit that is spongy ? 
UNKNOWN I don't think so . 
UNKNOWN I think we we can have like yeah a pear is good , fit well , or banana as you told . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Something like that . 
UNKNOWN But that's not in the trend . 
UNKNOWN You can make it um It's not hard , the metal . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN . 
UNKNOWN The trend is spongy , and vegetable fruits . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think p spongy is good because it it will be robust as well . 
UNKNOWN Plastic . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN So , I think we can keep the wheel because it's uh easy , it's innovative , even if the cost is a bit higher , and we also have to find a , so , a fruit like pear or banana wit uh any others idea you have . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN What kind of fr fruit would you like to to control your T_V_ with ? 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Odi Banana is also yellow so you you can't lost your remote control then . 
UNKNOWN Banana I think , it's a nice idea . 
UNKNOWN Because But You y you don't use the banana when the banana is curving like that , but when the banana is curving like that , with the wheel on the top and to control , and here you have a a push button to Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Two of the button , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But you don't have Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think it's a good idea , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah so you can just have uh just have this curve , yeah , and you move uh your hand here to press the buttons and then you move uh on the other side . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So you can have it on on two sides and it'll be cool , no ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think it's a good design and it's innovative as well then . 
UNKNOWN Maybe we can keep the banana . 
UNKNOWN And it will be very easy to find . 
UNKNOWN You can put also vibrator inside . 
UNKNOWN And everybody knows what is a banana . 
UNKNOWN Basically . 
UNKNOWN If you if you start with uh fancy fruits and fra s and tha Oh , yeah So So we will just use a a standard battery ? 
UNKNOWN Ah-ha . 
UNKNOWN You can also take into account the fact that the banana fits with the colour scheme of our company . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah it's really uh really a good point . 
UNKNOWN I hope the students of management die , but anyway . 
UNKNOWN Now who are recording this meeting ? 
UNKNOWN I think it So One second . 
UNKNOWN So we have to take some decision on this aspect . 
UNKNOWN So , uh so for sorry , for uh component , so we have to think about those aspects , sorry . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And uh the chip we chip imprint we know exactly which one we are going to use . 
UNKNOWN Uh what do you mean by case ? 
UNKNOWN I think it's the box that should be spongy , banana's shape . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh I mean for me if we use a a spongy banana case , doesn't matter . 
UNKNOWN I just want to have so something to prin to to fix my my components onto that box , and that's it . 
UNKNOWN The only th Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Y Yeah that can be in inside th in the structure . 
UNKNOWN Yeah yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But uh the thing is that the buttons and the wheel have to be I mean if it's spongy then the buttons and the wheel have to I mean if it's spongy then it's going to move , right ? 
UNKNOWN Spongy also . 
UNKNOWN So , it's going to be bend a lot . 
UNKNOWN So if we try to push the buttons , it You think it's possible ? 
UNKNOWN Oh no I think it's possible . 
UNKNOWN But No the button would be In fact it it should be something odd shaped , with a spongy cover . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN This is uh like the Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay odd shape with spongy cover . 
UNKNOWN And standard battery okay , a chip imprint , there's no specific problem . 
UNKNOWN So we agree to put the wheel So it have to it has to be symmetrical . 
UNKNOWN Wheel on the top . 
UNKNOWN Button , where do we want some buttons ? 
UNKNOWN Well , usually hold 'Kay , we want it to be good also for the left-hand users , right ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh Yeah but okay . 
UNKNOWN Sa let's say that th o It has to be basically you can only take two sides , one on ths this side where is the thumb and the other side where there is uh yeah also the thumb . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN Basically . 
UNKNOWN Or you could use use this one , but I don't know if it's very comfortable , to use this one for the wheel . 
UNKNOWN Yeah maybe the thumb is more comfortable . 
UNKNOWN This for the wheel and then this for the buttons ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah I think it's okay for both right and left . 
UNKNOWN Should have the two sides . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN So if the left , we have the op Wheel Wheel buttons . 
UNKNOWN I think you can turn it this way also . 
UNKNOWN You can do both with both hands . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , the problem is if you have buttons and wheel then when you turn it around , the buttons are on the other side . 
UNKNOWN I think it's okay . 
UNKNOWN So you cannot see them . 
UNKNOWN Well , you you will get used to it . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And moreover , th the button ar are lighted so you you immediately identify the right side , because you have light on buttons . 
UNKNOWN So the buttons have to be here and the wheel has to be Y Yeah I know , but uh if you hold with your left hand , and the wheel is here , and the buttons are here , then when you turn it around the buttons will be on the other side . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN No you you I think you will use it only on the right or left hand , whether you are righty or lefty . 
UNKNOWN I think for lefty it's okay . 
UNKNOWN I can do this movement , and for righty as well . 
UNKNOWN I think this doesn't change that much . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFUSION Maybe . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So , for interface we said also that we have uh this banana shape with button on the s on the side . 
UNKNOWN And and uh a wheel on the top . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So the colour is yellow . 
UNKNOWN I think it's uh we defined everything according to what we should what the decision we should take , yeah . 
UNKNOWN So maybe we can um we can uh work on those aspects uh until next meeting . 
UNKNOWN So have the final uh look and feel design according to the decision . 
UNKNOWN And have the the user interface design and uh then evaluate the prodyuc the product . 
UNKNOWN That is to say , uh check if it fit the the requirement uh given by the users , but according to uh your presentationit seems to be okay . 
UNKNOWN It seems to be fancy , innovative , and easy to use . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So so to prepare the prototype I would suggest that the Industrial Designer and the User Interface Designer uh work together . 
UNKNOWN That would uh be better , I think . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And uh And so uh you will receive further instruction by emails , as usual . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So do you need to add anything ? 
UNKNOWN Yes master . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN You feel okay ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN You feel uh free to express what you want to say ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN You don't feel too constrained ? 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN You don't feel free to answer this ? 
UNKNOWN Maybe you can make uh uh mm okay . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so See you . 
THANKS Thank you . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Je croix que c'est dommage de le it will be sad to destroy this prototype . 
UNKNOWN It really looks like a banana . 
UNKNOWN It is a banana . 
UNKNOWN It is a banana . 
UNKNOWN It is the essence of bananas . 
UNKNOWN I would be confused with this thing . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN S How is everyone ? 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
GREETING Hi . 
GREETING Hi . 
UNKNOWN So we are here for the detailed design meeting . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So we will uh I will first present what we are going to do in this meeting . 
UNKNOWN Then uh I've I will also take notesduring this meeting and I will send you uh a summary then as usual . 
UNKNOWN We will then look at the evaluation criteria of the prototype presented by uh our two colleagues that make good work . 
UNKNOWN And uh then we will see the financial aspects and the cost of the product . 
UNKNOWN Then we will uh evaluate the product . 
UNKNOWN And uh end with the conclusion of this project and see whether it fits with it fulf if it fulfil the requirement or not . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So d let's start with the cost aspect so so I look at the aspect discussed last time , that is to say uh to have a standard battery , to have a yellow banana shaped uh case with uh a rubber material around it to be uh to feel spongy , and uh also at the different aspect like having a wheel etcetera . 
UNKNOWN Like a banana . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN And the cost ended to be ten point seven Euros . 
UNKNOWN So which is uh good , because we had a price gap of twelve point five Euros . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So for the financial aspect it's okay , we can uh we can continue with this product uh as if , and we are now going to see the project evaluation with uh our marketing expert . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So uh you can have my project in Uh yeah just a Four . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN You have a presentation? 
UNKNOWN Participant four , yes . 
UNKNOWN Evaluation . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So you can go . 
UNKNOWN We can go through . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So I made an evaluation and the the evaluation criteria is made according to the users' requirements and the market trends we talked about uh during the previous uh meetings . 
UNKNOWN So you can go through and okay so uh we have uh six points . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN We we talked about before . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So we we want to have a product fancy look and feel , technologically innovative , easy to use , fashion , easy to find in a room , and robust , uh and uh uh I have a scale of uh seven points . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So I go through all the uh all the points here , and uh according to what you think about the this project you can uh mm make a one point , two point or seven point . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN And after we ha we have an an average , and uh we see . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN The okay ? 
UNKNOWN Uh so uh fancy look and feel , what do you think ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Maybe you can presen okay . 
UNKNOWN F between o one and seven . 
UNKNOWN Maybe hold it . 
UNKNOWN So I think it's uh very uh very nice . 
UNKNOWN I give it a I give it a five . 
UNKNOWN What do you think ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So it's between one and seven ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Seven is the highest uh ? 
UNKNOWN Seven is the Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN I will give a six . 
UNKNOWN I will give a a five . 
UNKNOWN And you ? 
UNKNOWN sorry . 
UNKNOWN Do you vote uh Christine ? 
UNKNOWN eh ? 
UNKNOWN Do you also vote ? 
UNKNOWN No , I just want to see something Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Maybe we all have to agree on a common Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well , we can very easily . 
UNKNOWN Uh I think uh and need to as well . 
UNKNOWN No problem . 
UNKNOWN Need to uh I don't know if you we ha we have to put uh one uh f If it's better or Uh-uh . 
UNKNOWN So this is your One is most . 
UNKNOWN I So it will have five point five average . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Well , we can choose what we want . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay , let's say that seven is the best . 
UNKNOWN Or maybe we can say s seven is the best mm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So so do note the grade we have five , six for me , five . 
UNKNOWN Five . 
UNKNOWN And what what's your choice ? 
UNKNOWN Oh sorry . 
UNKNOWN Six Uh s you can how much what ? 
UNKNOWN How much would you give on the fancy aspect , on the fashionable aspect ? 
UNKNOWN How much would you you don't answer to this uh questionnaire ? 
UNKNOWN Oh yes I mm I dunno mm , I think six , it's a good uh Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Five point five average . 
UNKNOWN Wa can . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Well , does it Okay , techne technological aspect . 
UNKNOWN I sorry . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So after , the technological aspect ? 
UNKNOWN So we we said uh we have uh a new technological uh thing with a wheel . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , we have the wheel . 
CONFUSION Uh . 
UNKNOWN We also have the rubber material , which make it uh like new also . 
UNKNOWN I think I would give a five . 
UNKNOWN It's four . 
UNKNOWN Four ? 
UNKNOWN A four also , because , except for the wheel , we don't have so much innovation . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN The rubber is Uh a four . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN D are we including the voice are you glu are we including the voice in the end or not ? 
UNKNOWN I I Yeah . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN Huh ? 
NEGATION No . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So what's your uh grade ? 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN Four . 
UNKNOWN Four ? 
UNKNOWN So we have four , four f and five ? 
UNKNOWN We can put four ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN For twenty five . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , four . 
UNKNOWN Everyone is okay or four poin Four . 
UNKNOWN Four , yeah , let's put four . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Doesn't it Yeah , I think so . 
UNKNOWN Very easy to use . 
UNKNOWN Do you think it's easy to use ? 
UNKNOWN I give a seven , I think . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Six . 
UNKNOWN I would give a I would give a seven as well . 
UNKNOWN It's very easy to use . 
UNKNOWN Mm , six for me also . 
UNKNOWN Six . 
UNKNOWN So six point five . 
UNKNOWN Six point five . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN Six six six point five . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Is it fashion ? 
UNKNOWN Oh yeah , its its f its fruit fruit shape . 
UNKNOWN Seven ? 
UNKNOWN I would say seven . 
UNKNOWN And is very very nice design . 
UNKNOWN Yeah it's fashion , because it's a fruit , and we say that the yeah , seven . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , we can we can put a seven here . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , seven . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Seven , okay . 
UNKNOWN Well , we hope . 
UNKNOWN Easy to find . 
UNKNOWN Uh easy to find in a room ? 
UNKNOWN I lost my banana . 
UNKNOWN I think you can't miss it . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFUSION Uh . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I think it's cool . 
UNKNOWN I think we can put a six here . 
UNKNOWN We have the lightning , or The lighting . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , we have the we don't sesh especially have the lightning but So it's yellow . 
UNKNOWN So you'll make the material transparent so that it uh lights up completely , or Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It's okay . 
UNKNOWN I think it's very easy to I would say seven . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Seven ? 
UNKNOWN It's hard to miss it . 
UNKNOWN Six . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , okay . 
UNKNOWN Is it is it robust ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , it's rubber , made of rubber , I think it's m it's uh more rubber than uh other remote control . 
UNKNOWN Uh f yeah , it's ru it's rubber . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah the only problem there might be which know , i if it's very sensitive , they will , I don't know Yeah , okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But it is uh it is surrounded by rubber material . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So maybe we can put a six . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Everybody is okay , six . 
UNKNOWN Six or five . 
UNKNOWN Five . 
UNKNOWN Six is okay ? 
UNKNOWN Six , yeah , for me . 
UNKNOWN Six . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN S now um so . 
UNKNOWN Tadada . 
UNKNOWN We have to sum up everything . 
UNKNOWN Twenty . 
UNKNOWN Thirteen uh , twenty , twenty six point five , uh seven , thirty two , thirty six . 
UNKNOWN Thirty . 
UNKNOWN Thir Okay . 
UNKNOWN That's that's okay ? 
UNKNOWN Six . 
UNKNOWN Six is a good Yeah , the be . 
UNKNOWN Good . 
UNKNOWN Uh if we say that seven it's uh it's the better , and when uh s six sit six are good it's a good uh p product , I think . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , the top Mm . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so six is a So it's a good evaluation , I think . 
UNKNOWN So will become eight soon ? 
UNKNOWN It's very promising . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , well it's a bit biased . 
UNKNOWN We have a good price and uh . 
UNKNOWN Huh . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Good . 
UNKNOWN So this prototype is quite nice . 
UNKNOWN Because I saw uh some phones that were banana shaped , uh wireless phones not mobile ones , wireless for the house , uh quite big also , and they were selling something like a hundred Euros , two hundred Euros . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Just a just a phone , wireless . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So having this at twenty five Euros is uh quite attractive , I think . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think the Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But almo also the complexity between a phone and a remote control is not cannot compare . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , it's much more complex , but Okay . 
UNKNOWN So , I think , we can summarise . 
UNKNOWN So we have seen the prototype . 
UNKNOWN It's very nice according to the work of our two designer . 
UNKNOWN The the the financial aspect were okay . 
UNKNOWN We we have the cost below uh our threshold and so we could sell at twenty five Euros and make i make profit . 
UNKNOWN The the evaluation give satisfying result as well . 
UNKNOWN So I think we can move to the last part of the meeting . 
UNKNOWN So the cost is in the budget , the evaluation is okay , so I th I think we can now uh open champagne and make a huge party . 
UNKNOWN Start to eat banana . 
UNKNOWN I don't know if it's provided by uh by the meeting staff . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Okay so congratulation . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Congratulations to the team . 
UNKNOWN Nice product . 
UNKNOWN Uh very well , we worked together fantastically . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think it was a good collaboration uh . 
UNKNOWN Aspect . 
UNKNOWN So what does the management say ? 
CONFUSION Sorry ? 
UNKNOWN What does the management say ? 
UNKNOWN I think we will have um much bigger project next time and a much bigger salary as well . 
UNKNOWN Ah . 
UNKNOWN All it depends on who watch this meeting . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN We don't know . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so good guys , so see you for next uh successful project . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Fruits . 
UNKNOWN Mm 'kay . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN So we are here to talk about functional design . 
UNKNOWN Now hopefully we've all got a better idea from than we did f leaving the last meeting as to what it is we are up to now . 
UNKNOWN So here's an agenda. 
UNKNOWN Uh I'll open . 
UNKNOWN Um you should know that I'll be taking minutesduring all the meetings , as I was struggling to our last time uh and that'll be easier for me now because I'm not actually giving the whole presentation. 
UNKNOWN Uh the additional points are just the stuff that we sent and that I forwarded on from upper management having a few bright ideas to make our lives painful . 
UNKNOWN Um now you can all give your presentations. 
UNKNOWN We can talk about the requirements and hopefully come to some decisions . 
UNKNOWN Right , forty minutes for this meeting , so a bit more time than the last one . 
UNKNOWN Here's the additional points I just wanted to put those in there to see if you guys had any comments on them . 
UNKNOWN Uh did you all receive that email? 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So does anyone have any overall Mm . 
UNKNOWN Well uh what comes up for me is that if we're gonna if we're gonna be marketing a product that is going to be uh having no teletext , people are very comfortable with the idea of having teletext and using teletext , and so we're not we're gonna be a new product without something that people are very comfortable having right now . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN So that's , from a marketing perspective I I see I see a lack . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN And so we have to go , I think , in the other direction . 
UNKNOWN What are we gonna have that makes this thing better than Right . 
UNKNOWN Well tha that first point could uh also be an op opportunity because in seeing that teletext is becoming outdated , some sort remote control that can work with the Internet there is the opportunity that's presented , I guess . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN No , I I agree with you . 
UNKNOWN So what I'm talking about is I see that one side we're eliminating something so we have to come up with another side which is , what are we gonna be targeting our market uh that identifies our product as better than because it doesn't have teletext it has ta-ta-ta-ta-ta . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So that's that's that was my reactions . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN but but we are sort of being dictated that this should only be for the television . 
UNKNOWN Yeah yeah . 
UNKNOWN So we're quite fixed . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN So we're really probably , in terms of marketing , are looking for that's uh that's a cost winner rather than a fantastic new feature product . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah bu but we we're designing only the remote , we not design the T_V_ . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN So uh we're gonna be removing the teletext out of any T_V_ that we people use our remote with . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN That's right . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN I think we take with you . 
UNKNOWN So it's kind of a stupid decision . 
UNKNOWN But there's also the potential for mark there's a market here for our lost teletext . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN For example someone that just goes to the shop that wants a replacement wants it as cheap as possible . 
UNKNOWN Twenty-five Euros is the selling price , we really have to innovate here I guess . 
UNKNOWN That's what I'm that's what I'm talking about is is that we have to find something that is gonna be very attractive about this product 'cause somebody , some people are gonna be hap unhappy 'cause it took they can't ac access their teletext . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause we're talking about eighty percent or ninety percent or ninety-five percent of the televisions out there are are teletext . 
UNKNOWN K yeah . 
UNKNOWN So so it's it's not that I'm criticizing the product at all . 
UNKNOWN It's just when we eliminate that then what do we bring ? 
UNKNOWN What are we bringing in to take the place of this , and we have to d in my opinion we have to double up . 
UNKNOWN Mm 'kay . 
UNKNOWN If we lose one we need to bring two or three . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Okay I think that the last point is probably quite uh straightforward . 
UNKNOWN Obviously the the w it has to be branded . 
UNKNOWN So then the double R_ will be our our I tho I tho I thou I think Rol Ro Rolls-Royce might mind , but don't worry . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN On the product yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think one of I think w , yeah , one of the things that we should also keep in mind um when we're doing this I mean our company's slogan is we put the fashion in electronics , right . 
UNKNOWN Can you handle that black and yellow ? 
UNKNOWN So I think our kind of our target here is to have some kind of very like sleek nice look remote and we want it to be functional as well , but I think one of the main selling points is that we don't want it to be clunky like like this thing here . 
UNKNOWN You know we don't wanna a big clunker . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN We want something that looks nice and it's fashionable and so That's fine . 
UNKNOWN So you have this ? 
UNKNOWN Nah . 
UNKNOWN So we have three presentations, and I think we'll go in order of participant number here . 
UNKNOWN So we can have a look at the working design first from participant two . 
UNKNOWN That's Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN Okay so so you all know me , I'm the Industrial Designer . 
UNKNOWN Mm it's enough . 
UNKNOWN But uh click it on off ? 
UNKNOWN And we've some basic components that um our remote is gonna need , just basically every remote'll need 'em . 
UNKNOWN We need some kinda of power d power source . 
UNKNOWN Um we have to decide on our our user interface , which is his department , but the in user interface is also a major component . 
UNKNOWN Um we need a programmable digital signal processor to um to take the input from the user and translate that into uh into electronic signal , which we pass to the infra-red L_E_D_ , which you aim at the television uh which and it receives that signal . 
UNKNOWN You need a on-off switch um I don't know how that got in there . 
UNKNOWN And uh we also need to um have the if we want a universal remote we need to have encryption codes for the different makes of T_V_s . 
UNKNOWN So we need to know all the different you know all the different signals and so that'll require some memory as well . 
UNKNOWN Um so here's just a basic layoutof how how the remote would work . 
UNKNOWN You ha the v the power source is in the upper right-hand corner there , and you can see that uh we have the user interface here which is connected to the chip which does all our signal processing , and then passes that signal on to the infra-red L_E_D_ and that signal is then emitted and received by the television at the photo-transistor . 
UNKNOWN So those are the basic components that need to go into this and everything else is pretty much uh open to move around . 
UNKNOWN Now is would this be considered just a standard uh um This is not this is not cutting edge technology we're talking here . 
UNKNOWN I think any des No . 
UNKNOWN We're talking about existing technology . 
UNKNOWN Right I think Yeah this is just this is just a basic layoutof ev of all the components that w w are gonna be absolutely necessary f to have a working remote . 
UNKNOWN Nothing is being modified or upgraded or new discoveries . 
UNKNOWN We can add things in like if we wanted some voice recognition , I mean that I mean that you can kinda say would would fall under the user interface and the digital signal processing chip . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Do we have an idea of costs of different components ? 
UNKNOWN But Um well the most the most costly components are gonna be the chip and the uh th it could als basically the user interface and the casing are gonna be expensive as well . 
UNKNOWN Um the L_E_D_ and the the transistors and everything else are you know they're they're pretty cheap . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN So depending on what we want our functionality to be , um the chip could be expensive or it could be cheap . 
UNKNOWN Um depending on the n amount of memory we need in there and stuff like that and h and h you know how much power . 
UNKNOWN Mm 'kay . 
UNKNOWN Do we have any ballpark figures for that yet ? 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN Uh I don't have any figures right now . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN We uh we have to wait until we get to a more specific design phase for that . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN N okay . 
UNKNOWN Um but and I think a significant part of the cost could be the actual the actual casing itself and and you know the the b the buttons and things like that , I think . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Mm the shell ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Basically yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So yeah . 
UNKNOWN That's all I have really . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Thanks . 
UNKNOWN And we have participant three , which I believe is Pedro . 
UNKNOWN I Hey mouse . 
UNKNOWN I can give you that to click on . 
UNKNOWN Open . 
UNKNOWN And you wanna get View a slideshow , that's what you wanna do , yeah ? 
UNKNOWN When we're fighting over it's also more lot more fun . 
UNKNOWN Just go up to view . 
CONFUSION Uh . 
UNKNOWN Click , don't Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Mm 'kay But I t I think what the the management recommendation was less that there's a worry that teletext will become outdated rather than we shouldn't have it . 
UNKNOWN This doesn't work . 
UNKNOWN So yeah function design . 
UNKNOWN Um you guys know me , Pedro , and um what I found is we want to do fashion and I think , honestly , we should keep technology low and just simple basically and try to aim for design . 
UNKNOWN If basically a case will will cost the same if it looks good or bad so we ma we have to make it look good . 
UNKNOWN Um something cute and small . 
UNKNOWN The big chunky remotes are died in the eighties . 
UNKNOWN So we should just go for something that people will like to actually look at . 
UNKNOWN And um although mo most people will buy s televisions and everything for uh that have loads of loads of little functions and everything and they mostly end up using simple functions and little things and most the people won't won't get too mad of actually having to go the to the s to the television to , for instance , tune in their the stations . 
UNKNOWN There's no need to have that in the remote . 
UNKNOWN So um um as for what I would recommend for uh the the interface design , and uh I will change the colours on the on the logo , but um we should go for the user-oriented device , so simple controls and good ergonomics . 
UNKNOWN Um and uh although I th I th I'm still here recommending the teletext so I'll remove that , I guess , but um we should go for the Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So I I still think if it's cheap enough functionality-wise to include , it really should be in there . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Because otherwise we're just going to I mean even if it's necessary or not , if you if you're given the choice between a t a remote with teletext or without uh when it really if it i if it isn't more expensive for us to k make because as far as I understand it , it can be operated with the same set of buttons , yeah ? 
UNKNOWN Right as far as i it's just uh the cost of an extra button . 
UNKNOWN So it should be in there . 
UNKNOWN I mean software-wise there's really no difference . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN I think . 
UNKNOWN Isn't Well maybe what we're getting into here is the the idea of uh Internet through the T_V_ for example . 
UNKNOWN I have maybe a silly question . 
UNKNOWN I in the very beginning it said with the with the advent of computers there's gonna be the it's gonna be out-moded teletext . 
UNKNOWN I I don't understand how those two things are connected . 
UNKNOWN How does how does computers and teletext h how why is one eliminating the need of the other ? 
UNKNOWN I don't understand that . 
UNKNOWN So that might play on what we can do . 
UNKNOWN Yeah the they're basically aiming at saying that you would use you know a couple of years ago teletext to be the easiest way to check like for uh uh the scheduling and the next programme and stuff like that and now Yeah and now you can c look it over Internet . 
UNKNOWN Scheduling . 
UNKNOWN Um to find out what what you're watching even if there's commercials you know . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN But I still think teletext is way more convenient until until we have the same commodities . 
UNKNOWN I think I ha I agree . 
UNKNOWN Yeah 'cause , yeah , I just I don't see the cross-over between computers and television . 
UNKNOWN I mean I do see the cross-over in some sense , but but but but with the the remote is is used for television , okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but it's not happen yet . 
UNKNOWN Well for me Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well you have digital T_V_ still already . 
UNKNOWN So so if we make the cross-over and we're gonna view television on computers then we're then we're losing the the necessity of the remote . 
UNKNOWN Unless you have a Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well there there is a for example on digital T_V_ systems you have you can press a button and you can buy things in adverts , and you can uh you can view through a catalogue for example . 
UNKNOWN S Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN A a family member of mine has got a system where you just um you can Yeah , and there's other features for example on other systems where you can pause live T_V_ and things like that . 
UNKNOWN They're just features from the Internet uh from computers are are coming into the T_V_ sort of under the covers , but you still use it through a teletext . 
UNKNOWN So now the things to think here are that that there's gonna be more functionality , potentially that we can handle . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah but we we don't we're not aiming a command for that . 
UNKNOWN That's the thing . 
UNKNOWN And all of those require the other commands with more complexity and more software and Yeah but we would increase the price to try to make it a trainable one , so Well I dunno . 
UNKNOWN I think a lot of that's proprietary anyways . 
UNKNOWN You're not gonna be able to , you , like command a TiVo with our remote . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN I don't think . 
UNKNOWN But still there there's an opportunity . 
UNKNOWN If if it's , for example , a trainable one then we're just simply having like an up , down , left , right , an okay button or something like that might might do as well in future proofing it . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN One way the other teletext was there but I guess we can remove it or , you know , make two separate interface designs. 
UNKNOWN I think if it's possible you should try to you know have a talk with management about that . 
UNKNOWN Just you know Right it's just not Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah I don't I don't see the logic . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I I don't see the logic in elimination of teletext , I just I I but I'm not a tech-mind either . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , and neither do I in fact . 
UNKNOWN I just don't see the cross-over between computers and and and 'Cause we are designing something for a television , okay . 
UNKNOWN Bu uh . 
UNKNOWN I'll communicate that back to those guys there a a and th the message really we wanna be sending to them is that , although teletext may become outdated w there's no l logic in not having it in there anyway i if it doesn't affect the price . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN We are selling it to an existing market . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um but I I think what they're pushing us towards here is in terms of thinking of ways to future-proof our system for future systems that have something else other than teletext maybe . 
UNKNOWN Yeah but we're not putting some there's no no putting anything in in the place of teletext . 
UNKNOWN I dunno I'm Mm 'kay . 
UNKNOWN That's Yeah , and and , yeah , and and we're also marketing a product . 
UNKNOWN That's the problem . 
UNKNOWN It's what I'm seeing is a is a mid-range cost product . 
UNKNOWN So so w we can't go and pump a whole bunch of technology into this thing because all of a sudden we are gonna have cost overruns . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So if we drop if we are gonna choose to drop teletext , again what are we adding to the product that makes it marketable ? 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN So if we're keeping it basic we're loo loo what we're looking to sell it basically is it's uh just being very easy to use , looking exceptionally good , that sort of thing . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause we really don't have anything else there , do we ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I don't I don't see it , and to me if I'm gonna market a product for b for beauty for for design I'm gonna I'm gonna try to market it at a much higher price . 
UNKNOWN I need to make it special with a high price tag . 
UNKNOWN I don't want to make it economically uh g uh competitive . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN I want I want to market it as exclusive . 
UNKNOWN So I would market this product it at eighty-nine Euros and come up with some really beautiful exterior design or something th but but I don't think we have that flexibility . 
UNKNOWN But i if design if design is cheap and functionality is basic , then twenty-five Euros is probably a high price for a commoner garden stan standard T_V_ so the place uh remote the then the place we're going to justify that cost is through through design through making it a a sleek elegant high-priced basic remote . 
UNKNOWN Does that make sense , huh ? 
UNKNOWN No I no I I understand what you say , but what I'm what I'm , okay we probably need to move along , but my my concern is trying to find a marketing niche for this product , and if I'm coming in with a with with twenty-five Euros , which is mid-market price , um then what am I going to give these people for this ? 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah we probably should . 
UNKNOWN We we're doing alright for time . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So that's just my question , but we can keep talking . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Sorry that kinda cut into you there . 
UNKNOWN Well Right . 
UNKNOWN No just I I would I would advocate for continuing teletext and those would be the basic commands . 
UNKNOWN Um as for , you know , the the case design uh maybe I'll come up with more concrete ideas . 
UNKNOWN Right now it's just the idea of simplicity and slickness , cute and small um Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I'm just thinking you know with all these universal remotes that are out there , how many people how many people actually use every feature that ar you know i like these trainable remotes and things like that , where , you know , it's just so confusing to do to use all these functions . 
UNKNOWN Where I think the largest portion of the market is just gonna you know they lost their T_V_ remote , they need another one that'll work with their T_V_ . 
UNKNOWN They want something that looks nice , that that that isn't gonna break when they drop it , that you know that maybe it's it's ergonomic , it feels good in your hand , something like that . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN I think that's gonna be where you're gonna find the biggest , you know , market share . 
UNKNOWN So we are looking for something that looks good and just works , rather than looking for any special features . 
UNKNOWN Is that Mm . 
UNKNOWN I think the more bells and whistles we add , it's just gonna cut into our into our profits . 
UNKNOWN Because I think as we as we add costs for things like uh for like if we add the voice recognition and things like that , I think you know what percentage of the of the um of the market is actually gonna use that ? 
UNKNOWN Maybe five percent , you know , and how much Right . 
UNKNOWN Yeah mm . 
UNKNOWN But we can talk a little bit more potentially in the marketing marketing presentationabout this . 
UNKNOWN Yeah okay . 
UNKNOWN Be a good idea . 
UNKNOWN I'm sorry . 
UNKNOWN Uh sorry , I didn't mean to cut in . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Sorry boss . 
UNKNOWN I'm not the boss . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Oh P Pedro , I just want to say quickly I I would really like it when you can come up with some more bells and whistles , eh . 
UNKNOWN You know sell uh things come to my mind is uh uh something that's uh um voice-activated . 
UNKNOWN I know we're getting into some , I hope , some big money on this thing , but Is that for over here ? 
UNKNOWN I think that's probably a question more for for this guy here , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay , alright . 
UNKNOWN Well it's kinda both of us . 
UNKNOWN Us us user interface . 
UNKNOWN Is it ? 
UNKNOWN That's 'Cause uh and I think of voice-activated I think of of how many times I've I've lost my my remote and I can't find it . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So some way that I can I can find my remote by clapping my hands or something uh and and so so um But this 's just something . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN I was thinking about that . 
UNKNOWN Then your lights would go off , though . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN I'm trying to find some bells and whistles 'cause when they talk about tel taking out teletext , it's like , what are we gonna put in ? 
UNKNOWN What makes this thing attractive ? 
UNKNOWN And it's only for televisions . 
UNKNOWN So we everyth our our competition out there has got these these multiple adaptors where they can use 'em for their V_C_R_s , their D_V_D_s , their their televisions and we're coming out with one remote for television only . 
UNKNOWN And so to me we have to make this a really special product I I I don't s I really have to say I don't see the market niche for this product . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN At this price I don't see it yet . 
UNKNOWN I'm I I go along with this , because this is what we're given to try to market , but I I don't see the market niche for this product without without some really sort of something really special to identify it as as unique in the market . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN But we th that should be design . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN That should be the design basically . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN I think technology we'd we we're not in the price range to do it . 
UNKNOWN We don't have the money to do it towards t f technology so we should we should aim at design . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Have to do you have to do it in the box ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay well , so so that's up to you then to to make this box in something that's absolutely extraordinary . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Maybe make it in the form of a gun . 
UNKNOWN We can sell it in United States . 
UNKNOWN I have a question uh for you . 
UNKNOWN Does any of the um the features that Pedro's spoken about here have any implications we might not have thought about on in terms of just pure functionality ? 
UNKNOWN In terms of making it work or the cost of that or Okay . 
UNKNOWN I don't I think all these things are pretty standard . 
UNKNOWN I think we'll be okay . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN Cheers . 
UNKNOWN Onto participant four . 
UNKNOWN Well you know for marketing f marketing for me is uh and uh how do I go here ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Mm you can just click . 
UNKNOWN Go go . 
UNKNOWN Is that right ? 
UNKNOWN No no no you just get off that . 
UNKNOWN You just click anywhere . 
UNKNOWN Ah-ha . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , what for me is it um I d I don't know what I'm marketing right now , okay , 'til you spoke and when I wrote this , I don't know what I'm marketing . 
UNKNOWN I just know that I I was identified as a a we identified ourselves as a as a developer , as a manufacturer , and as a as a um distributor t to other wholesalers . 
UNKNOWN And so the th the twenty-five Euros that we've identified as the sale price is a wholesale price rather than a retail price . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN That's what we decided here . 
UNKNOWN Um so what I did is I I decided that that this this needs to be a product in a in a sense can market itself . 
UNKNOWN So what we've identified here as our main marketing stratagem is is in design . 
UNKNOWN We're making the most beautiful attractive uh whatever we decide it is . 
UNKNOWN So that means we have about seven more minutes or ten minutes left . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um so I would like to have a product that that we can sell easily . 
UNKNOWN So I say inspiration , so having something beauty , something attractive , uh something that in a sense will sell itself . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Uh innovation I think fits into what we're talking about here with design . 
UNKNOWN Uh cutting edge technology , I don't think we're gonna have that , these were ideas I was putting together , um unless we come up with some New Age product a as far as the casing is concerned . 
UNKNOWN I I wanna make this thing something that I can identify as special in some way , so maybe we can have some I I talked about environmentally sensitive , uh maybe we have a product that can be identified in some way as advantageous in a home . 
UNKNOWN I don't know . 
UNKNOWN These are just thoughts . 
UNKNOWN Uh I wanted to talk about uh who we are as a as a corporation , that we're new , we're aggressive , we're competitive , we're we're trying to provide a product from a new perspective rather than from an old corporate line . 
UNKNOWN So to me it's about selling d uh our identity our corporate identity along with the product . 
UNKNOWN Um what I found is that the projected costs are competitive . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Uh we're kind of in the middle of the market , but what I'm seeing is that the market is ready for I I identified new technology , but again , because what I see is budget restrictions and limitations , I don't know that we can bring any new technology into this thing . 
UNKNOWN If if we could have a technological something Mm p please . 
UNKNOWN I have an idea . 
UNKNOWN And it's kind of along the s lines of environmentally sensitive , and it may even fit into ergonomics , and even kind of address the issue of losing losing the remote , what we were saying it's a common issue . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Um what we can do is , well you know that batteries throwing a aw remotes run through batteries like crazy . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Right ? 
UNKNOWN And s for some people Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Solar . 
UNKNOWN Well maybe not a solar remote but instead what about if we had like a power cradle ? 
UNKNOWN But solar Blah , I like it . 
UNKNOWN Like a a cradle that is is there to hold the remote when you're not using it , so you'll always know where the remote is 'cause you have to put it back there to charge the remote , and we can , instead of having instead of having , you know , replaceable batteries we'll just have a power cell that stays there for the life of the remote . 
UNKNOWN You never have to get go through the go through uh all these different batteries . 
UNKNOWN And also you can I I think it's a good opportunity for the user design or for not just for the user design , but also for the just for the look and feel of the remote as as a whole . 
UNKNOWN You know you could have some kind of neat little , you know , a sexy design for d a cradle and the remote itself . 
UNKNOWN I like the idea , but we're talking about in cost is gonna probably double . 
UNKNOWN It w it would increase the cost . 
UNKNOWN But boy , we can sell this thing , because there's no batteries , it's environmentally sensitive , i we can identify it as a safer product in some form . 
UNKNOWN And you could pagethe remote if you lose it . 
UNKNOWN Maybe there's a button on the cradle . 
UNKNOWN Yep , that's right . 
UNKNOWN I really see But the cost i No no . 
UNKNOWN Now the the question is can we make this for less than twelve-fifty per ? 
UNKNOWN No no , we have t we have to change the end cost . 
UNKNOWN There's uh I mean I don't see it anyway . 
UNKNOWN We we well do we necessarily have to change the end cost because uh Can we dl can we do that without uh changing it twelve-fifty per product , if we basically can sell more based on this ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's gonna be up to these guys . 
UNKNOWN I my reaction is no , but Well , see I I see I I'm an advocate to make this an exclusive product . 
UNKNOWN Well what I can do is I can d look into ho well Pedro and I can look into how much this might increase our our costs and you can look into what kind of effect an increased cost is gonna have on our on our final numbers . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah we we can certainly push for a more expensive product if that's gonna be Nah , I think we can say with certainty now that we are supporting teletext . 
UNKNOWN You know , let's let's sell this wholesale for for fifty Euros , sixty Euros . 
UNKNOWN Let's make this thing really exclusive , environmentally sensitive , uh high-tech design , uh ergonomics , all of this . 
UNKNOWN Just make this thing uh , yeah , the the the Rolls Royce of of remote controls . 
UNKNOWN I I Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Every home's got to have it . 
UNKNOWN If you don't have one , hey what kind of remote do you have ? 
UNKNOWN Oh you've got one of those , oh fantastic , I want one of those too . 
UNKNOWN I just don't have enough money right now . 
UNKNOWN I just don't know about that , because in order to do that in order to price it at that kind of level I think we'd need to have every functionality that all the other competitors are offering like being able to operate , you know , the D_V_D_ player and , you know , the stereo system and all that . 
UNKNOWN Which is a pretty basic function that w we've opted out of . 
UNKNOWN And additionally we're m maybe not supporting teletext um But I do think there are some basic features that we don't have that a lot of other remotes are going to have . 
UNKNOWN Yep , one one thing I don't understand is h they've they've given us this package , okay . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Now uh in my opinion we need to give them a package back , okay . 
UNKNOWN They say they say okay here you go . 
UNKNOWN They gave us a fundament a foundation of of what they want , and and w it's our place to kinda analyse and evaluate . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN I don't think it's our place to create their product for them , maybe it is . 
UNKNOWN I don't know what kind of role we have in this in the corporate ladder uh , but to me it's like , okay , you have got your here's our ideas , okay . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN And then let them look at those ideas and they say , yeah well , we can we can raise the price twenty percent , you know we like this idea , this idea no , but to me it's it's about a choice , do we follow their directives or do we make uh presentationsback and and then and then discuss ? 
UNKNOWN beca I I do not I do not see the market niche for the product that they're handing f handing us right now . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN I don't see it . 
UNKNOWN I don I I d I have to disagree though . 
UNKNOWN I think our market niche is basically people who need who have lost their remote or uh who've broken their remote and don't wanna send back to the manufacturer , they just wanna run out to the store and get a remote , and then they're gonna look on the shelf and they're gonna see ours is the nicest looking remote . 
UNKNOWN It does what they need . 
UNKNOWN These aren't I I think that it Right . 
UNKNOWN And and th to get to back to another point , sorry uh uh for cutting in but , I th I think it's important to remember that that this remote has to work with multiple T_V_s , yeah , 'cause it's selling on its own . 
UNKNOWN It's not going to be specifically for Hitachi T_V_s or or whatever . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN No I understand that . 
UNKNOWN So technologically , if I understand it , uh T_V_s T_V_ remote's working exactly the same way as video remotes and D_V_D_ remotes . 
UNKNOWN All you need to do is train them to the individual one , all you need to do is is know the the f like some four-digit code . 
UNKNOWN So saying that it works with all T_V_s is equivalent to saying that it'll work with D_V_D_s and other things . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Nope , they've identified the product as not working for anything but televisions . 
UNKNOWN Yeah y y you you wouldn't The interface will be different . 
UNKNOWN They've identified this product limita That's why I say I don't I don't see the market niche for this . 
UNKNOWN Oh okay okay . 
UNKNOWN We have done this . 
UNKNOWN If we if w if we were going to have a product that worked for D_V_D_s , V_C_R_s and everything , then I can see the market niche , but we we're only identified as going for televisions without teletext . 
UNKNOWN I see . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN And it's like whoa we ha in my opinion we have to go with something that's extremely exclusive to make this thing marketable , because who wants just a television remote ? 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Well here's Right . 
UNKNOWN And I I'd Mm sorry . 
UNKNOWN I don't . 
UNKNOWN We he well here's my thing about that . 
UNKNOWN If you're in the market for this ultimate remote , you're not gonna go for just a television remote . 
UNKNOWN If it can't control if it can't control your your D_V_D_ player and a al if y if you can't get that all-in-one ultimate remote , that just you can throw all your other remotes away . 
UNKNOWN That's right . 
UNKNOWN I'm not gonna buy a d seventy-five Euro remote . 
UNKNOWN I I I have a tendency to agree with you . 
UNKNOWN I really do . 
UNKNOWN So we really can't chase that . 
UNKNOWN That's why I say I quest I q I question the marketability of the product . 
UNKNOWN I really question where we create the demand . 
UNKNOWN So I think what we So that's what I'm saying Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN We're really looking for something basic . 
UNKNOWN The the one thing that that that you said really struck a chord with me here in that we're we're carrying the corporate identity with the product , but we're actually looking for a large profit at the same time where I'd be inclined to go back to upper-level management and say like let's just cut down our profit expected on this product because we are actually branding our company here . 
UNKNOWN We're selling more than just the product . 
UNKNOWN We're trying to get mind-share about uh Real Reaction to to the people who are gonna buy consumer electronics . 
UNKNOWN We want people to eventually say , oh that's that's Real Reaction that's a good m make . 
UNKNOWN It's reliable . 
UNKNOWN And and we're gonna make it we're gonna win mind-share by uh either being a fantastic product or for it working , it just being good , reasonable-priced , and solid . 
UNKNOWN So if we can make if we can put an emphasis here on it not breaking I think that's in itself an extremely big thing . 
UNKNOWN I think that's big . 
UNKNOWN W okay if you if you drop the cost , now if you make if you make go to the other side of the cost scale , and you make it less expensive , then all of a sudden now we're going into an a a new market area . 
UNKNOWN So we can say low-cost uh uh um uh good design , beautiful , wa-da-da-da-da-da . 
UNKNOWN Good design . 
UNKNOWN We only have a few minutes left . 
UNKNOWN But what I'm saying is right now we're middle market . 
UNKNOWN Is twenty-five Euros a mid-market price for a remote ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah for for multi for a multi-function remote , that's a mid-market price . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN I think so , yeah . 
UNKNOWN In a discount right now you can buy 'em on sale sometimes for about about uh eighteen , nineteen Euro , and that's for the multi-functions , uh D_V_D_ , V_C_R_ , uh catch-alls . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN And and they have 'em in a little box in the middle , and and this is the consciousness that most people have about replacement remote controls . 
UNKNOWN So to me , to market this a t only a television remote control we have to change consciousness . 
UNKNOWN We have to have something that will change people's thinking to identify this as advantageous , and I don't know what that is . 
UNKNOWN It's gotta be low-cost or high-cost with with special design features . 
UNKNOWN Well I'd be inclined to say , if we can make the design better than any comparable remote while reducing the cost , then that's the way we really should play it . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN If we can take it down to you know fifteen rather than twenty-five and make a low profit-margin on it , but we're really doing that to sell the brand . 
UNKNOWN Yep we have five minutes left . 
UNKNOWN Uh rather th uh to to to sell for Real Reactions . 
UNKNOWN Or my d I mean I I well we g we're talking about the other end now . 
UNKNOWN And I can communicate this to to the more senior uh mm people within the company here to to get a reaction . 
UNKNOWN What about um the idea that I had with the cradle ? 
UNKNOWN How do you feel about that ? 
UNKNOWN Or how does everybody feel ? 
UNKNOWN Well how does everybody feel ? 
UNKNOWN I I think The other the o the problem with that in my mind I just think off-hand as a as a consumer , would I wanna buy that ? 
UNKNOWN I like it . 
UNKNOWN I like the idea , but we have t we have to find out Well . 
UNKNOWN No , but I that's the thing I I don't think it's necessarily the other end . 
UNKNOWN And I think maybe not because I've got a remote and I'll take it to different chairs , I'll take it to different I w I don't wanna go over somewhere and put it down . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN It i if it is gonna be somewhere that you put it down then it needs to be at the side of your armchair , and that implies that there's only one T_V_ user . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN So it's very good for some people but it's not a like But it it takes away the ease of use of the remote to a certain extent . 
UNKNOWN Well it lasts it would last for several hours on its own power , but when you're done with it you put it back in the cradle . 
UNKNOWN Yeah well it Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN You have to l sort of remember . 
UNKNOWN You have to d shift down the side of the couch to find it and put it back and Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN I d I d I d I think it it in my mind it doesn't seem like something that oh I'd really want uh because of that fact . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN But I I don't know , that's just my opinion . 
UNKNOWN Well , I think again it's it we have a cost issue here . 
UNKNOWN You know if we're gonna go in this direction , to me we're going to the other side of the cost range . 
UNKNOWN Are we gonna make this selling selling the cost as a high high-tech uh um environmentally sensitive whatever , or are we gonna go to the lower side of the range ? 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Again I don't see our market niche in the middle for our product yet . 
UNKNOWN I don't see it yet . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN So what do we think maybe we should Pedro , do you have any opinion on it ? 
UNKNOWN Uh we should keep it simple , mm medium-low cost mar um cost area and uh make it look good . 
UNKNOWN W a question I have in in a 'cause I I I think I agree with you on , we gotta make it a box . 
UNKNOWN The box is gonna sell it I think , the outside , the casing . 
UNKNOWN Really need to wrap up now . 
UNKNOWN Can can can we have multiple designs? 
UNKNOWN Have a modern , have a traditional , have a you know , and so so instead of them all looking the same , people can have maybe four or five different designsthey can choose from . 
UNKNOWN I don't know what that creates cost , or Yep one over another . 
UNKNOWN Well the the problem with that is we may end up with a whole bunch of inventory of a of a poor design you know . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , okay , I hear that . 
UNKNOWN So Um but what we could do is some kind of well I mean Yeah we we need to , I mean , have a few designsto look at and then come up with something that I think we all agree is , you know , the best fit . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , complicated but Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think w what's really important is it has to look good , it has to feel it has to feel good in your hand , it has to be durable , it has to a and I think it's really important that it doesn't look cheap . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think I think we have to make sure people look at it an and feel like it its like a quality remote . 
UNKNOWN Even though the cost may be low . 
UNKNOWN What ab what ab what about a a remote that's that doesn't maybe look like a remote ? 
UNKNOWN Just an idea . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Just just okay 'cause I mean we all know what a remote looks like on the outside . 
UNKNOWN They're selling these things everywhere . 
UNKNOWN Maybe that could be part of our design exclusivity , is we make a remote that doesn't even look like a remote it it opens like a telephone . 
UNKNOWN Or what if it looks like a pen ? 
UNKNOWN Doesn't matter , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I'm just jus I talking about some something to make this thing unique . 
UNKNOWN A pointer ? 
UNKNOWN It That's the thing , I'm gonna keep thumping on . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I'll sell whatever you guys design . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I don't have a problem selling a product , that's not the issue . 
UNKNOWN I give you ideas , you guys create the product . 
UNKNOWN Once you have the finished product I'll find a way to sell it . 
UNKNOWN Don't worry about it . 
UNKNOWN I just give you these things now , because these are my thoughts and feelings . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So just to touch on m my point one last time that I had brought up . 
UNKNOWN Um I really un unless you guys are die-hard against the fact that um it's possible like it reduces the usability of the remote b and the fact that you can't lose it on your own , I think it still might be a good idea to investigate having like a power cradle . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Because I really think i in a certain sense it almost like for me I would want to have that just , because I know at the end of when I'm done watching T_V_ that when I'm done , oh I better go find the remote and put it back where it belongs . 
UNKNOWN Maybe th th th that's just some people that like that . 
UNKNOWN I mean there's al there's also remote controls I remember that that worked uh , this hasn't been done in a while I think , but th as a as a watch . 
UNKNOWN A lot of people As a watch ? 
UNKNOWN No no . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , there is remote control watches um , but I think they're a sorta eighties thing , so it might not be easy to market in it uh but the the technologies came along and it might be cheaper to make now . 
UNKNOWN Mm 'kay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah they are not simple . 
UNKNOWN Those things may have been inexpensive for all I know . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN One thing I just thought about when you were saying that , is that the p our target market is gonna be someone who has lost or broken We gotta stop ? 
UNKNOWN That's what I was saying . 
UNKNOWN Who's lost or broken their their remote . 
UNKNOWN Gotta cut up . 
UNKNOWN So how many remotes do they wanna buy ? 
UNKNOWN Can we p can we sell them a remote that can maybe guarantee they will not need to buy another one ? 
UNKNOWN Exactly . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And so with with with this kind of system or locator or something , to to think about , how have people been been losing or breaking their remote ? 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN How does this happen ? 
UNKNOWN The last remote you'll ever buy . 
UNKNOWN And also presumably they've Exactly . 
UNKNOWN And and then and then design the product , maybe some component of the product that can identify this as the last one you'll ever need to buy . 
UNKNOWN Well if if we're going down that then we can we don't need to go the it it strikes me that the locator feature might actually be uh quite expensive to make . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Whereas actually just putting it in a power cradle might not be too expensive at all because that's just done with mobile phones you can just n we we have said we have actually similar products that we can take from and potentially cut costs there . 
UNKNOWN True . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN The locator'll definitely be more expensive . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um need to look into whether we can do that but uh I think we we have some m mobile phone-based products uh checking quickly our Internet . 
UNKNOWN We really need to finish up here . 
UNKNOWN uh we can make it in the shape of a coffee pot . 
UNKNOWN But uh Yeah we have the the power-adaptor products . 
UNKNOWN We sell power-adaptor products . 
UNKNOWN So for example there's nothing stopping us using that technology . 
UNKNOWN It's uh just it's that I think it's telling us to stop our meeting . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So we have the c we probably have have on-line in our in our system , we have the ability to create this , we're talking about . 
UNKNOWN Yeah I think so , without it being too In fact we can cut costs through using the manufacturing that's already gonna be in place here . 
UNKNOWN A charging system . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN If if we can create this we have probably five or six or seven really strong marketing characteristics . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN I think one of the things that we can put right on the box is , never buy another battery . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN You know , something like that . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN Thanks guys . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN No that's not what I want , I want Oh look it here . 
UNKNOWN Afternoon guys . 
UNKNOWN It's gonna be . 
UNKNOWN Rock and roll . 
SURPRISE Oh .
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN So do we need to re-train Mike on how to put his mic on ? 
UNKNOWN Think s Mm . 
UNKNOWN We may do . 
UNKNOWN Okay , can he get it all by himself this time ? 
UNKNOWN I dunno , I'm feeling like a big boy . 
UNKNOWN Pro Probably not , 'cause he's 'S been listening to too much . 
UNKNOWN So I believe I can fly . 
UNKNOWN He's getting retarded . 
UNKNOWN Alright well we got some exciting stuff for you guys . 
UNKNOWN Yay . 
UNKNOWN Or not . 
UNKNOWN Or not . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Just what I needed was something exciting . 
UNKNOWN Remember , I'm an old man . 
UNKNOWN 'Kay , ready to go ? 
UNKNOWN All ready . 
UNKNOWN 'Kay so we've got our conceptual design meeting . 
UNKNOWN Apparently I'm old as well . 
UNKNOWN Hopefully we've all got exciting ideas now . 
UNKNOWN Thirty's really young , eh ? 
UNKNOWN We do . 
UNKNOWN Uh k exciting ideas . 
UNKNOWN 'Kay so here's our agendaour agenda. 
UNKNOWN Um I'm gonna open . 
UNKNOWN I'm gonna talk for a bit about what we're gonna do . 
UNKNOWN I'm gonna take some notes. 
UNKNOWN We're gonna all do a presentation, and then hopefully we're gonna make some decisions now . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
UNKNOWN Well when I say hopefully , we have to . 
UNKNOWN So I'm gonna let you guys talk before we make decisions . 
UNKNOWN And does anyone really want to go first ? 
UNKNOWN I guess I'll go first . 
UNKNOWN You p two ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN What's Components design . 
UNKNOWN Component , I think . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yep that's it . 
UNKNOWN Presented by name . 
UNKNOWN My name is . 
UNKNOWN Jose he man is . 
UNKNOWN Your name is name ? 
UNKNOWN My name is name . 
UNKNOWN Huh hi name . 
UNKNOWN My name is Inigo Montoya . 
UNKNOWN You killed my father . 
UNKNOWN Sorry I did this in a bit of a rush . 
UNKNOWN Prepare to die . 
UNKNOWN N name . 
UNKNOWN So so here's a look inside your really old-looking remote control . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Um you've got a printed a printed uh circuit board here , and you've got all these buttons which kinda press down little rubber nubbies into these little holes that activate Yeah we've all broken a remote control . 
UNKNOWN We've all broke a remote control ri um s yeah . 
UNKNOWN I've I just love you tech guys , huh . 
UNKNOWN So you've also got um you've got your chip here , your batteries here , and some sorta electronics . 
UNKNOWN Um Well so you've got here's here's a transistor , and this amplifies your signal , um you've got the L_E_D_ here on the end of the uh uh on the end of the printed circuit board . 
UNKNOWN They just Yeah y do jabber . 
UNKNOWN Yeah there's a thingy and a dingy and Nah . 
UNKNOWN You press this and it does th I dunno who and whatnot . 
UNKNOWN Um you've got a couple diodes here for I don't know who and whatnot . 
UNKNOWN So exactly . 
UNKNOWN So um we've got a i in this in this uh drawinghe uh in this example here , this is a eighteen pin um uh chip I dunno . 
UNKNOWN P Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh it's two double A_ batteries . 
UNKNOWN This is pretty standard remote . 
UNKNOWN So here are options for our power sources . 
UNKNOWN You can use a basic battery , which we've already discussed , um th our tech department also said we have the option of doing some kind of hand dynamo where maybe you crank it or something like that . 
UNKNOWN I don't know if that's really I don't know we got some qu crazy guys down there in that department so You shake it . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN I wanna change that . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN I I gotta I gotta flashlight , and uh yeah but it's interesting 'cause you shake it like this . 
UNKNOWN Like this . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So that's the next bullet is the um the kinetic provision of energy , so it's like that flashlight where you have to shake it . 
UNKNOWN And that's on the camera . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN Uh we've got solar cells , which I don't think is a very good idea because um you could not use your remote at night which doesn't make a lot of sense . 
UNKNOWN Mm 'kay . 
UNKNOWN And finally we've got our cradle o our power cradle idea . 
UNKNOWN Okay so we basically have battery versus cradle here ? 
UNKNOWN M battery versus cradle I think is yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN I like the kinetic . 
UNKNOWN So we have battery versus cradle It's actually a novel thing because you could sell it a as a novelty , just to be actually serious for a minutehere , you could Mm . 
UNKNOWN I g I I figured you would . 
UNKNOWN It could be fun . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well it is it is more uh I mean it is more eco-friendly than the than the cradle 'cause you're still using power off the grid with the cradle . 
UNKNOWN So um our case design . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN We have uh choices in materials and choices in the general shapes that we can do . 
UNKNOWN Our material choices are a plastic latex um ty or plastic , a rubber latex type thing , uh wood , or titanium . 
UNKNOWN If we go with titanium we're gonna be uh limited in the amount of shapes we can do because it's tough to shape the titanium , and uh Yeah pers I think wood i I I can't see anybody wanting to use a wooden remote , it's just anti-technology really , you know . 
UNKNOWN Wood wood would ge would give us a little bit of a marketing niche , wouldn't it . 
UNKNOWN Nah . 
UNKNOWN It it it Uh . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Uh uh to me in a marketing sense it's not it's not relative . 
UNKNOWN We can we can o we can uh accentuate whatever whatever product you put in there we can find a way to accentuate it . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN And what we may be able to do , and I think this might be the best option is to combine some a couple of these . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um my recommendation personally would be to do some kind of a plastic inner shell with a like a rubber outer shell , to make it um to mak uh like a thick plastic inner shell and a t um kind of a to have that rubber outer shell to make it more durable , and also maybe i I think it feels a little better than the plastic . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN Do you get a good grip on the rubber ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah um Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah okay . 
UNKNOWN And if you make it from that super rubber , when you drop it on the floor it can bounce right back up in your hand . 
UNKNOWN You don't even need to lean down to get it . 
UNKNOWN The advantages of working with plastic and rubber is w we we'll have a lot more um options just in terms of shape because you can extrude plastic in basically any shape you want . 
UNKNOWN So um and then we can cover you know the breakable bits with rubber yeah so um But basically these are curved and double-curved I I believe that the tech department , in their um in their message to me , that they were referring to the number of th curves in the bottom . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN I have no idea exactly what they're talking about , but that's what they told me , uncurved , flat , curved , or double-curved . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN I would guess this like this pen would be kinda like a double-curved , where it's curved on m m multiple axes , right ? 
UNKNOWN I think curved means just curved in one axis and double-curved is curved in two axes or surfaces . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN I have no idea . 
UNKNOWN I think it might mean something like that sorta shape because a double curve rather than a yeah that's what . 
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm yeah that's yeah that's what I see . 
UNKNOWN Oh okay oh like a wave , okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah that's what I see also . 
UNKNOWN Alright that makes sense okay . 
UNKNOWN Um okay , with the interface we have the following options , we can u we can use push buttons , we can use a scroll wheel with an integrated push button , and L_C_D_ display , or multiple scrolling wheels . 
UNKNOWN Ooh . 
UNKNOWN Um so these are all options that the user interface guy can uh has at his disposal to put together a user interface . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN For electronics , we have these very technical um descriptions here . 
UNKNOWN A simple chip , which is the least expensive , but I have no numbers to give you , a regular chip , which is like the medium porridge the medium expense uh Yes the difference is , with a simple chip a simple chip will operate oh why doesn't this scroll up ? 
UNKNOWN D do we have actually any concept of what the difference is between a simple chip and an advanced chip ? 
UNKNOWN Previous previous , okay . 
UNKNOWN A simple chip is required to operate push buttons . 
UNKNOWN Um an advanced chip is required to to operate um the L_C_D_ display , and it didn't say specifically , but I I have a hunch that a regular chip is gonna be the scroll wheel and the multiple scroll wheels . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So but yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah that makes sense . 
UNKNOWN That's the end of my presentation. 
UNKNOWN So presentationfrom I guess design would go best . 
UNKNOWN Next . 
UNKNOWN Technical functions or interface concept ? 
UNKNOWN I think No . 
UNKNOWN Oh interface concept . 
UNKNOWN Yeah that's it . 
UNKNOWN Very long presentation. 
UNKNOWN Yes , but it has your name on it . 
UNKNOWN Well that doesn't bo bode well for it for it tats as well . 
UNKNOWN Um so , somehow that thing's too big , but um okay um our uh manufacturing division wanted the speech recognition . 
UNKNOWN They say they could put it to work but um we don't think so . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN It it it you'll be you know be affected by the by the other speech and Yeah and and fighting for the remote would not be fun anymore , and I think that's one of the things we wanna keep . 
UNKNOWN If the T_V_ is working , yeah . 
UNKNOWN That's just I mean it'll if somebody says up in the middle of a television show , it's gonna change the channel . 
UNKNOWN So Well then why don't you just press the up button ? 
UNKNOWN But what if you actually had to press a button to make it recognize ? 
UNKNOWN So if you pressed it and went , up ? 
UNKNOWN That kinda would r d yeah . 
UNKNOWN Man yeah . 
UNKNOWN That would kind of lose it . 
UNKNOWN But if it's just one thing with a button that you can just go Up . 
UNKNOWN That's right . 
UNKNOWN Even still there's gonna be interf th there's there still will be interference from the T_V_ . 
UNKNOWN It might not be it might not be completely confusing , but I think you'll still y it's still I don't think it's practical at all . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , okay . 
UNKNOWN I think it's a bad idea frankly . 
UNKNOWN Yeah so um taking that away , our uh the the the rubber but rubber buttons are the more reliable it's the the ones that would al would allow us to to market our product as being you know less prone to damage and more resistant to things like spillage of liquids over it or you know mistreat misuses as it happens to remote controls . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN You guys know your stuff . 
UNKNOWN Um as for the point that we making about losing it . 
UNKNOWN Well , we wanna small r remote control one side because uh we want it to be cool and uh designed , but um apparently um market shows that bigger s bigger um remotes get less lost , about But um yeah I think we we need to compromise between those two and somehow we'll do that . 
UNKNOWN That I would believe . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Somehow . 
UNKNOWN Um so the the what I would propose is something more or less in the uh direction of what is to yo the right of that slideuh but without with a l a less complicated um design , so the numbers , the volume control , and channel control , and teletext access . 
UNKNOWN Uh the volume and channel control can just become those the the four button array as in if it was a round dial . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN And um if you just think about it as the one to the right but with the numbers and the four buttons plus maybe a centre one with teletext . 
UNKNOWN So we're suggesting doing a sorta scroll wheel thing for the volume ? 
UNKNOWN Ye no it's not i i it's just four buttons that are on a cross , so that you ba basically can control all of the important tasks from that alone . 
UNKNOWN That's not a scroll wheel . 
UNKNOWN Nah . 
UNKNOWN Oh okay okay . 
UNKNOWN I see . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Instead of play , stop , rewind , and fast forward there , that's up , down , louder , and quieter . 
UNKNOWN Uh , okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah um yeah so I think we w we go for something mid-sized , so something looks good and uh is not too prone to get lost . 
UNKNOWN That be it . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN So on to Y functional requirements or trend watching ? 
UNKNOWN I dunno . 
UNKNOWN Trend watching has a later date there . 
UNKNOWN Trend watching I guess . 
UNKNOWN Trend watching I believe . 
UNKNOWN forty six nineteen fifty seven . 
UNKNOWN See what it looks like . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN It's been so long . 
UNKNOWN . 
UNKNOWN Well I don't know what to say . 
UNKNOWN When I s when I see the when I see the product I I I I don't wanna buy it . 
UNKNOWN I see so many of 'em out there . 
UNKNOWN There's nothing about that product that makes me wanna choose that product over other products that are out there . 
UNKNOWN Are you talking about the picture ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah yeah . 
UNKNOWN That's not our that's not our b design , that's just a that's just something he a a graphic he used to show you the layoutof what the layoutof the buttons might be like . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Okay 'cause 'cause right now I don't have too much to say about how to market this product because we don't have a product to market yet . 
UNKNOWN And uh from from talking to Mike is that we have we have uh we can market a more expensive product now . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN That's what I understand so , hello . 
UNKNOWN Upper management said yes . 
UNKNOWN Uh e excuse that , that's a bit of spam . 
UNKNOWN And and so yeah I'm a I'm a little bit stuck right now in that what uh w what is it that I'm gonna market ? 
UNKNOWN Uh without special or increased marketable features I don't believe the product has a consumer demand . 
UNKNOWN Uh I like the idea of of the scroll makin there are so many people making these products at this price right now . 
UNKNOWN What are we gonna do to make this one special and unique ? 
UNKNOWN What's special and unique about a scroll ? 
UNKNOWN Uh well I don't yeah it's I I just see it as different . 
UNKNOWN It's cool . 
UNKNOWN I don't say it's specially mm I don't say it's special . 
UNKNOWN Uh I say that it's different I what I'm looking for as marketing is m give me something different . 
UNKNOWN I give me a lower price , give me a higher price , give me some new technology , don't give me the same thing that everybody else is putting out there on the shelf it's f at the same price . 
UNKNOWN I need something to market about this thing . 
UNKNOWN We're we're a new firm . 
UNKNOWN I'd I'd say though that we if we did make the decision to go with the cradle though , the then we have that as well , but wi with a similar Mm . 
UNKNOWN What i if when when we have yeah when we when we have something like the cradle or or something give that's as as a marketing standard I need something to market , to make this product unique . 
UNKNOWN Well right I think the two big th points that we have so far are the having the cradle and also having uh the um the actual design of the uh case itself having like this like rubber shell maybe with a plastic interior , having it look really nice um and also be really durable . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN Mm 'kay . 
UNKNOWN Just remember when I made up this reportI didn't have the information that we're discussing here . 
UNKNOWN Right yeah . 
UNKNOWN And and so so uh yeah when we have a cradle , when we have some kind of design , so what I'm saying is , from my perspective , I don't have a product to market right now . 
UNKNOWN Course . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um uh my personal preference is that we make some adjustment in the cost , either lower or develop an integrated new technol technology . 
UNKNOWN That's that is the next step , there's technology and then there is technology , which we're moving into the next phase . 
UNKNOWN Yeah 'cause that's . 
UNKNOWN And so uh we're gonna have some new technology to enhance the marketability . 
UNKNOWN Yeah uh again I'm not sold on the product because we don't have a product in my opinion yet . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN So I need a product . 
UNKNOWN Mm 'kay . 
UNKNOWN Well let's get a product then . 
UNKNOWN I need a product to market . 
UNKNOWN And I just whatever product you guys put together , we'll find a way to market it . 
UNKNOWN Tha that I'm not concerned with . 
UNKNOWN So now So our big questions here really are cradle or not cradle ? 
UNKNOWN If you if you give me if you give me a cut-out of what everybody else has then I need to I need to find a lower cost . 
UNKNOWN Do we go basic or do we go for features ? 
UNKNOWN Uh d does anyone really wanna do anything with the scroll wheel or should we ditch that off-hand first ? 
UNKNOWN Well my question is what would the scroll wheel do ? 
UNKNOWN Function-wise , what does that do that Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Oh but that was in your presentationso wh what would you imagine it doing ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah wh wh what's the wh Okay now what I see with the scroll wheel is everybody has buttons . 
UNKNOWN Well it's it's just another way to do the exact same thing that the buttons do . 
UNKNOWN Mm 'kay . 
UNKNOWN But would we I dunno . 
UNKNOWN So from a marketing standpoint I have I have another door to walk through when we have something that's unique . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN If it creates something more complex or more expensive , then I don't know if that makes it uh a marketing necessity . 
UNKNOWN But again , from a marketing perspective I want as much new and different about this thing as possible because we're we're co it's a very competitive market . 
UNKNOWN What I understand about scroll wheels is they're they're quite expensive to to make . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Th they are gonna be more expensive , but on the other hand , I mean , it I mean it is an alternative if if you think that's gonna sell some some uh you know if if we're gonna make up the extra cost by extra sales I think maybe it's worth it to do it , but I mean I would just use if I was gonna do this I would just use the scroll wheel for s channels up and channels down . 
UNKNOWN So I d Well I d I like the idea of basically focusing the my personal preference is focusing the p the product on the idea of the uh the case the the uh dock to put it in to to charge it . 
UNKNOWN I don't think volume or do you think volume would be No we can we can do multiple scroll wheels but Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN I'll bet first in volume maybe . 
UNKNOWN I dunno . 
UNKNOWN We can target like environmentally friendly ideas , that sorta things . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN It s i m makes it easy to market , it's easy to differentiate the product , yeah so . 
UNKNOWN Yeah yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think it's that's right . 
UNKNOWN I think so . 
UNKNOWN And if we we keep the rest in a format that is durable because th th the whole product's gonna need to be more durable th thus because you're not going to be ditching it as often . 
UNKNOWN It's gonna need to be more expensive because of the cradle . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN So if we can market it in terms of that and yeah well So our big decision then is like how do we do um like we have to decide on the details and we have to decide on well n not exactly the details , but d do we have uh What type of casing ? 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN I think we got some exclusivity in that , you know , we got something that nobody else has right now , and and that means we can we can make some adjustments in the retail or wholesale price if we need to and it also can create it's own demand from it's uniqueness . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I personally like what you were saying about the plastic with the rubber . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN I'm thinking yeah something like kinda almost like these pens , you know , where there's you have plastic bits and then it's not really rubber but just kinda like a fused the plastic with rubber on the outside . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Just a very thin sorta sheetfor a a grip , sorta thing or for Okay . 
UNKNOWN Well no ma yeah maybe a bit more then th is on here but ju just as a kind of an inspiration , these pens I think are are kind of Or from from my perspective I think L_C_D_ is a mistake because this is a universal remote and all you're doing I mean it's you're not gonna get any information back from the television , so the only information you can display on this remote is what channel you just sent it at last and there's just not a lot of information , you know , there . 
UNKNOWN So then if we d d do we want to do anything more basic with the uh more advanced with the user interface in terms of do we want to go for um buttons , or do we want if we're ditching the scroll wheels do we want to go L_C_D_ ? 
UNKNOWN Do we want to give do we want to have anything else on it ? 
UNKNOWN It's only a T_V_ . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN It receives no information . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So I I don't see any reason for having an L_C_D_ 'cause it's an increased cost . 
UNKNOWN Unless you can think of something interesting to do with it . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah right now there's right now there's nothing coming out of the T_V_ to receive , so you know unless technology changes and information starts coming out of the a cable box or something there's no s I don't see the , I don't see the necessity of an L_C_D_ either . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Don't see it . 
UNKNOWN Okay so the question is now I guess we need t to decide on well y you guys basically have to now go and figure out the details of this thing . 
UNKNOWN So , what we need to know in terms of marketing and uh project management are are there any other questions that we need to answer now before you guys can go and build this ? 
UNKNOWN What what overall things have we not decided on ? 
UNKNOWN Well we have to I think for me it's still not exactly clear exactly what the inter user interface is gonna be . 
UNKNOWN There's the scroll wheel , in or out ? 
UNKNOWN What do you guys like in the user interface ? 
UNKNOWN I think maybe in terms of marketing , is that gonna make enough of a difference to justify the cost ? 
UNKNOWN Again . 
UNKNOWN Well I think it's it's the more uniqueness you can bring to the product , the easier it is , I believe , for me to market . 
UNKNOWN Uh again the push-buttons I I see are are everywhere . 
UNKNOWN And so we can go with the same thing , but we're gonna be com competing in a in a broader market than if we go with something unique . 
UNKNOWN You know the other thing I thought about was you know , do we go to something like this ? 
UNKNOWN Make a remote that doesn't look like a remote . 
UNKNOWN It's just another it's just a an idea , and I don't know I mean what I see one of the things one of the things you brought up in an earlier presentationis , when you got children , their their stuff gets inside the circuitry , they get dirty , they get messy with drinks and stuff . 
UNKNOWN Well I dunno about like the flip-phone idea , because I think , as far as durability th it's not a big well maybe when it's closed . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN This And what I keep throwing out there I just keep throwing out ideas to try to make this thing look or act or in some way identify itself as unique or different . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN But you guys are the ones that have to c ultimately create the product within cost . 
UNKNOWN Yeah and I guess th th the question th th that you're being asked right now is whether is the dock enough of a unique feature to be able to go out and sell that a a as a a very different product , or do we really need the scroll wheel as well ? 
UNKNOWN Because the scroll wheel comes at quite a cost . 
UNKNOWN Oh okay phew . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think you gotta g get into cost effectiveness . 
UNKNOWN I think if you can have the base station with a with a locator , I think those are two very strong features , if that's something that can be integrated without a bunch of extra cost . 
UNKNOWN Well The The locator's gonna require a radio transmitter , which will Um we're probably gonna have to go with a like a medium chip , s I would imagine . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN That's gonna n is that gonna need a better chip as well ? 
UNKNOWN No it's just different . 
UNKNOWN But we I we will need a receiver , an antenna . 
UNKNOWN Integrated , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So it's just uh I I think that's I know personally that would be a very attractive feature , is to have a uh have a button I can push to find my remote control . 
UNKNOWN It should be a really simple signal though so That's true yeah . 
UNKNOWN And it's presumably gonna need a little speaker in it or something like that as well to beep . 
UNKNOWN But I guess a little tiny speaker is gonna be quite cheap , it's not gonna need q quality , is it ? 
UNKNOWN Oh yeah yeah . 
UNKNOWN It's Makes your living room more fresh as you watch . 
UNKNOWN It'll be really cheap . 
UNKNOWN Or maybe you can like have a a smell-o-rama , you know you push a button and it s puts out a stink . 
UNKNOWN You can Yeah yeah yeah yeah . 
UNKNOWN Maybe not . 
UNKNOWN Okay we're doing well for time here . 
UNKNOWN S Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um we've got about another ten minutes . 
UNKNOWN I think that uh Mm pr my personal preference is out . 
UNKNOWN So the scroll wheel , in or out ? 
UNKNOWN I don't think the cost is justified for a little bit more uniqueness when we already have that , and I don't s think it's obvious and natural how it would be used . 
UNKNOWN Yeah I think we have like and it's not very usable and it will bring down the robustness of the whole thing , 'cause it's it it breaks down easier . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN For me I think the scroll wheel actually might not be so bad . 
UNKNOWN I don't know exactly what the increased cost is gonna be , but I think he does have a point , i it might push somebody over the edge when they're looking at our at our remote versus something else , when they see this one has a scroll wheel to go up and down on the channels . 
UNKNOWN I think it might be kinda neat to be able to do it like that . 
UNKNOWN But then that that surely d depends a little on the T_V_ because some T_V_s are quite slow at changing channels from like so if you've got a scroll wheel and you s you have to scroll scroll it really really slowly just so that you're actually keeping in pace with the T_V_'s ability to to change channels . 
UNKNOWN W Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Sure . 
UNKNOWN Or do you have to go through and you wait for it ? 
UNKNOWN You scroll it a bunch of times and you wait for it to Mm . 
UNKNOWN Well I think wh what it would be is like like the m like this , where it's maybe you know a digital wheel , right , where it's where it's quantized into you know certain That was that was my my intuition of what the scroll wheel would be . 
UNKNOWN Oh yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh I see I see . 
UNKNOWN That's where you Ah I see I see what you're talking about now . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN It's just it's basically it it's just a f look and feel thing . 
UNKNOWN It has the same exact functionality as two buttons . 
UNKNOWN I I think there's you know that uh there are so many people today that are that are surfing are television surfers , and I see the scroll as a as a great mechanism for surfing . 
UNKNOWN Instead of going button-to-bu you just j you'd j j j j j j . 
UNKNOWN Yeah if you're just sitting there going That's kinda cool actually . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I really I really think that's a really cool thing for surfing . 
UNKNOWN I like that . 
UNKNOWN Now just just so you know though uh you did bring up a point which is very valid , is a lot of T_V_s won't re the T_V_s won't respond exactly the same . 
UNKNOWN Some of them are gonna be kinda slow switching , so you may like queue up like fifteen channel changes , and it'll be like flip , flip , flip . 
UNKNOWN Well there's ano That's right . 
CONFIRMATION But Right . 
UNKNOWN Well not n necessarily . 
UNKNOWN You could basically make it so that it'll I mean it's just gonna be sending a signal to the T_V_ yeah the T_V_'s ge so if you send about five flip channels , if you did that it's gonna flip once . 
UNKNOWN If you do that . 
UNKNOWN Yeah it just might be frustrating where you can't make it go as fast as you want , but I think once people get used to it I I do like the idea of the scroll wheel though . 
UNKNOWN Other than click click click . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And if we're marketing it as a high niche product , then we're gonna be selling it to people who are buying good T_V_s as well , yeah , presumably . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah I think so . 
UNKNOWN Primarily . 
UNKNOWN I I think so . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN Now the the only thing I I on the interface side of it , is that I I I see the dilemma . 
UNKNOWN But if we have the option of of scrolling at any particular speed , or the option of jumping direct , okay . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So I can go uh presuming I have , on my television , something that tells me what channel I'm on , I can scroll direct from channel five to channel thirty two . 
UNKNOWN I know what because it's on the television . 
UNKNOWN The television tells me what channel it's on when I change it . 
UNKNOWN So I don't know that really that's that's gonna be a a d problem , 'cause the television can go automatically from channel five to channel thirty two with the push of a button . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Okay ? 
UNKNOWN So ca can we can we create that kind of interface within a scroll system ? 
UNKNOWN You understand what I'm saying ? 
UNKNOWN I think I know what you might be getting at , or or Well , what about this what about if you can programme in your favourite channels into this scroll wheel and you can just like roll through your favourite channels , and it c it Why ? 
UNKNOWN Oh I see so if maybe if we had an L_C_D_ up the top that just did a number on it , right ? 
UNKNOWN Oh no we could read it from the television . 
UNKNOWN And then it that basically Mm . 
UNKNOWN Well that's quite cool . 
UNKNOWN You'd need a display on the th the thing . 
UNKNOWN It'll tell you when you flip the channel on the T_V_ . 
UNKNOWN Yeah the the television can tell you . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Can . 
UNKNOWN Oh yeah yeah no I see what you're talking about . 
UNKNOWN Yeah that's kinda cool . 
UNKNOWN How would you program it though ? 
UNKNOWN Well you just it's one extra button . 
UNKNOWN You say programme start , and then type in 'cause you still have the typing you know you'll still have the keypad where you can type 'em in manually . 
UNKNOWN Put And then . 
UNKNOWN Okay okay . 
UNKNOWN So programme start , zero , one , enter , zero , five , enter , thirty eight , enter , programme end . 
UNKNOWN Okay and yeah and that just basically flips between it and it'll go it sends out zero , five , and then thirty six , and then zero , one again . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah that's kinda cool . 
UNKNOWN I like that . 
UNKNOWN And again we have another another great marketing tool . 
UNKNOWN We have about three we have three or four things here . 
UNKNOWN That's not gonna be too expensive because that's gonna be you're gonna be able to nab that off of computer mouse manufacturers really . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN You could basically come up with a partnership to be able to produce that quite cheaply . 
UNKNOWN I dunno and an maybe we maybe even have this as in-house technology . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN This may be something that's available through our own uh through our own services . 
UNKNOWN Might be , but tha that's not gonna be such a costly feature . 
UNKNOWN The problem we're gonna have is making it robust . 
UNKNOWN Oh well we also have to determine in some manner how to switch between modes , between going through your favourites list and just hitting up one , up two . 
UNKNOWN Making it last . 
UNKNOWN Or we go directional up we go we go this we go this we go this way for one , we go this way for the other . 
UNKNOWN So if there's a button for each type . 
UNKNOWN No because you wanna be able to go up and down through the channels . 
UNKNOWN Yeah people are gonna have their favourite sorta , whether they do that or whether they Yeah yeah the mode switch . 
UNKNOWN Ah-ha okay . 
UNKNOWN Okay , okay , well then you just have , you have a diff you have a mode switch . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN I think we'll need a we'll need a mode switch , but then if we have a mode switch we're gonna need some kinda indicator to which , an L_E_ an L_E_D_ okay . 
UNKNOWN Just the lights behind the buttons . 
UNKNOWN You could have back-lit buttons maybe . 
UNKNOWN Would that work ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Is that okay we have five minutes . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So right details th that we've talked about here are that we want a scroll wheel . 
UNKNOWN We want a mode indicator . 
UNKNOWN We want back-lit buttons . 
UNKNOWN And if we're making back-lit buttons period , do we want that just for the mode indicator or maybe to indicate what button you're pressing at the time , so that you know if it's actually pressed or not . 
UNKNOWN I've seen some remotes do that . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Just so you know I think I mean it was my understanding that before we were gonna stay in the mid-market range . 
UNKNOWN It seems we're kind of approaching a higher-end range . 
UNKNOWN Yeah yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think we are yeah . 
UNKNOWN I wanna make sure everybody's okay with that . 
UNKNOWN Well you had acknowledged that we have more money for this . 
UNKNOWN Yeah well we don't have it's not that we have more money , we can push up the the price . 
UNKNOWN Didn't you say so ? 
UNKNOWN That's what I mean . 
UNKNOWN We can increase the cost . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So I don't know I don't know whether having Well I think th I think the design and technology has to come back and say , okay to create this product we see it's gonna cost us this much for this volume , because we do have a volume target of of fifty million profit . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN I just wanna make sure everybody's on board with it . 
UNKNOWN So Right . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So we really need to be sure as to what we can push the cost up to , though we haven't got to a stage where we're ready to pin down the price of components . 
UNKNOWN But I'd say what sorta price are we looking to be able to sell something like that , and what sorta price can we make it for ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah no I I think that's where we really should be more flexible than anything else because as we said in the last meeting , our management is really looking for us to push our brand . 
UNKNOWN We're entering a new market here , so I think the the profit expectation for this one product is maybe not as important as being able to But th what's our ballpark as to what we'd be able to sell something like this for ? 
UNKNOWN Okay I'm I'm okay with that . 
UNKNOWN I guess what I just want to me the next step is for these guys to come come in with the design proposal w with the cost estimate attached , and then we have to take this to the next level . 
UNKNOWN Well y yeah . 
UNKNOWN Let's let's try and think now , how much would you pay for with all these features how much would you pay if you went to the store , and you were in the market f to replace your T_V_ remote , how much would you pay for that ? 
UNKNOWN We have to find cost . 
UNKNOWN But you've gotta think who our target market is because I I'm not our target market . 
UNKNOWN I'm just asking you . 
UNKNOWN I'm a student , but on the other hand I would think , mm with my Project Manager salary , I would think yeah I could probably afford this uh would I buy it ? 
UNKNOWN If Then you could probably afford this . 
CONFUSION Maybe . 
UNKNOWN If I had a cool new T_V_ and this was r looking really slick and it had the dock and it had the scroll wheel , which I think's a really cool idea , that would sell me on it a little . 
UNKNOWN Then maybe you know . 
UNKNOWN I do I don't think I'd go over a hundred Euro certainly , that would be way too much , but the I would be happy paying over forty for it , I guess , but not much 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN Oh no no . 
UNKNOWN I would say thirty five to forty . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I was gonna say thirty five to fifty . 
UNKNOWN Thirty five to fifty Euros is our sales bracket okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So the question is what we ca we make it for . 
UNKNOWN Because one of th one of the things we're marketing about this product is that this is the last one you will ever need to buy for your television . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN It's one of the marketing features in this . 
UNKNOWN That's why the scroll needs to be really robust . 
UNKNOWN Okay so we'll come up with something between thirty five and fifty that is rug rubber , robust , with scroll wheel , with the new facilities of the scroll wheel like favourite stuff , favourite channels , and and with a cradle , and yeah and the locator . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN With a cradle , radio transmitters , and back-lit buttons . 
UNKNOWN And it's gonna look sexy . 
UNKNOWN Or not . 
UNKNOWN Or not . 
UNKNOWN It might look like clay . 
UNKNOWN Okay so you can market pe depending on that ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah yeah . 
UNKNOWN Bas th that's that's easy . 
UNKNOWN That's that's not a , it's a . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause we have about six , six , seven features in that alone . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN Under the title of uniquenesses . 
CONFIRMATION Cool . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN The next meeting starts in thirty minutes , although does it ? 
UNKNOWN It starts at three twenty one , the next meeting . 
UNKNOWN So we've got more than a thirty minutes . 
UNKNOWN Um we've got more like fifty . 
UNKNOWN Well I have Is my three twenty one is the next meeting ? 
UNKNOWN The the ne next meeting is three twenty one yeah . 
UNKNOWN That's that's almost uh fifty minutes . 
UNKNOWN Yeah that is . 
UNKNOWN Uh they've they've changed the times from the presentations. 
UNKNOWN You guys can You guys you guys can uh create a All kinds of things . 
UNKNOWN Probably . 
UNKNOWN We'll let you know when we're done , if we can go earlier . 
UNKNOWN Thanks , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay so you guys will be getting your modelling done now and uh Okay are there any other questions with regards to what this thing's gonna do , look like , how it's gonna work that need to be addressed before we really look at this in a lot of detail ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I don't think so . 
UNKNOWN If we have any questions we'll just emailyou I guess . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah I think it pretty much everything's covered . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN This one was quite easy . 
UNKNOWN Coulda been worse . 
UNKNOWN Still . 
UNKNOWN Always the optimist . 
UNKNOWN Yes I am . 
UNKNOWN 'Kay thanks guys . 
THANKS Thank you . 
UNKNOWN I don't have any emails . 
UNKNOWN This means I can go home . 
UNKNOWN Oh , we all leave . 
UNKNOWN Uh 'kay . 
UNKNOWN So Yep . 
UNKNOWN So so so . 
UNKNOWN Put on your mic . 
UNKNOWN So you forgot how this works again ? 
UNKNOWN Boss . 
UNKNOWN Boss . 
CONFUSION Maybe . 
UNKNOWN Maybe maybe maybe . 
UNKNOWN Okay so we're here to talk about the detailed design of the product , 'kay ? 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN And here's the agendafor this meeting . 
UNKNOWN Uh I'm just gonna open , say a few boring words to start with again , and start taking minutesafterwards . 
UNKNOWN You guys are gonna give us a presentationof our wonder product that I can see some demonstrations of over there . 
UNKNOWN Looks cool . 
UNKNOWN And then we're gonna evaluate it . 
UNKNOWN Then we're gonna talk about finance , and I've got a lovely Excel spreadsheetthat I knocked up in the last five minutes for this . 
UNKNOWN Bra Mm that's oh that's oh I like it . 
UNKNOWN And uh yep . 
UNKNOWN Hmm you knocked it up ? 
UNKNOWN And we're gonna evaluate the product and close . 
UNKNOWN Got forty minutes to do this in . 
UNKNOWN We should be fine . 
UNKNOWN Let's try and keep this one on schedule . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
UNKNOWN So Your thing is in where is it ? 
UNKNOWN Thi third third third . 
UNKNOWN Is it in Who wants it ? 
UNKNOWN Three , three . 
UNKNOWN The end product thingy . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Pedro can have it . 
UNKNOWN I like I'll help talk . 
UNKNOWN . 
UNKNOWN Um yeah so what we ended up with . 
UNKNOWN Production costs estimated by our manufacturing department and um the research department , which is us , is uh fifteen point eight Euros , someone forgot the units there yeah , uh unit price unit production price cost thing . 
UNKNOWN Unit price . 
UNKNOWN Um we implemented the basic functions , which is just T_V_ functions plus the locator , which was one of the marketing things , cradle , scroll wheel for uh the the channels , and uh we implemented the f the the way of putting the new and revolutionary zapping , your favourite channels functionality , in the scroll . 
UNKNOWN Zapping your favourite channels , eh ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Scrolling through your favourites list . 
UNKNOWN Oh okay okay . 
UNKNOWN Zapping you know zapping . 
UNKNOWN Ah 'kay okay , that's favourites . 
UNKNOWN Maybe it's just a Portuguese thing . 
UNKNOWN And um yeah that was the result . 
UNKNOWN Ah 'kay . 
UNKNOWN I like the the the the logo on there as well . 
UNKNOWN It's very prominent . 
UNKNOWN It is very prominent . 
UNKNOWN So this is the Okay . 
UNKNOWN So here I'll give you the so this is the cradle unit , and this is the actual remote itself . 
UNKNOWN Um so the scroll bar is or the scroll wheel is this this green little scrolly guy here , um and then the volume controls are here and here . 
UNKNOWN Uh you've got the keypad which is the numbers uh f from zero to nine and then ten . 
UNKNOWN This is the power button . 
UNKNOWN Uh we have our um we have the enter button and uh what was the other button here ? 
UNKNOWN This is the teletext . 
UNKNOWN Start s the the start uh to to to programme yeah . 
UNKNOWN The programme button , yeah the programme button . 
UNKNOWN Ah , okay I see . 
UNKNOWN So this bl this button will be used both for the favourites and for programming your uh the um the type of television you wanna use . 
UNKNOWN So um the plastic is the white area of this of the model here , and the red area is like a rubber covering . 
UNKNOWN So you can see that when it lays like this or like this and the buttons are all gonna be rubber , so it's pretty hard to actually damage it um Yeah that might be a possible a mi uh possible problem , but if you drop it yeah . 
UNKNOWN It's pretty cool . 
UNKNOWN Is that could that be easy to for the scroll wheel to be rotated if it lands on it ? 
UNKNOWN Not helping . 
UNKNOWN Oh well I guess it depends on the stiffness a little of it . 
UNKNOWN Yeah and it depends on if it's sliding , but I think it's pretty ergonomic . 
UNKNOWN You can feel it . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Feels good . 
UNKNOWN I take it that this is gonna be slightly lighter in the final design as well . 
UNKNOWN Yeah of course . 
UNKNOWN Well this is clay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah it's kinda cool . 
UNKNOWN You have to reach a little bit don't you . 
UNKNOWN Yeah the the power button is a bit of a reach , but I think we might scale down the final model a bit . 
UNKNOWN Ah yeah that wouldn't make sense . 
UNKNOWN These this is a bit larger than it would be , but Mm Pedro can demonstrate the the paging ability . 
UNKNOWN It's cool . 
UNKNOWN I'm impressed . 
UNKNOWN Don't have no one to handle that . 
UNKNOWN And hold it so wh what's the marketing perspective ? 
UNKNOWN I mean you guys gave me more than I was asking for , so I'm happy because we've got some really marketable features in this . 
UNKNOWN Yeah I think it's good . 
UNKNOWN Good good good job . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So you ha you have like the the base station with um the little button for the where's my remote . 
UNKNOWN Beep beep beep . 
UNKNOWN Uh pla I'm ha It's great . 
UNKNOWN The locator function . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN That's great . 
UNKNOWN It's a great feature . 
UNKNOWN Um beep beep beep so beep beep beep beep beep beep be shut up . 
UNKNOWN Mm it's impressing . 
UNKNOWN So let me get it , if I press this button I see . 
UNKNOWN That's pretty cool . 
UNKNOWN Wicked isn't it ? 
UNKNOWN Hang on . 
UNKNOWN So you can take this ho take this home with you tonight and you can push that and he'll be across town Uh , I can see that . 
UNKNOWN Beep beep beep okay . 
UNKNOWN I plan to do that as well . 
UNKNOWN Um no no no tha that's alri Exactly that's exactly what those are for . 
UNKNOWN So the the two blue are are those for the the it to charge off of in ? 
UNKNOWN Ah okay okay . 
UNKNOWN And um there's one other feature that we were debating , but we decided to go against it , is um you could beep beep beep we were thinking that it might be interesting to have a trigger button here because you have this finger it it's it kinda feels like there should be something there , but we couldn't figure out what button is important enough to put there . 
UNKNOWN Yeah it's the right shape isn't it ? 
UNKNOWN And we we don't wanna accidentally be hitting the power button like that so Mm . 
UNKNOWN But maybe if you had a trigger plus the scroll then that would get past the the problem of it landing and scrolling , 'cause then it would need to be hit on both sides . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN So maybe in a final design phase we might tweak that a little bit , but Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN But it's definitely got options for like different types of models and things as well based on that , hasn't it ? 
UNKNOWN Yep I like . 
UNKNOWN Good job . 
UNKNOWN So is that the the final colour scheme as well or ? 
UNKNOWN Oh no this is just what we had to work with at the time . 
UNKNOWN No no . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So we'll leave the colour scheme up to the marketing people . 
UNKNOWN The hmm . 
UNKNOWN Careful . 
UNKNOWN It came off . 
UNKNOWN The scroll wheels , a problem with them not being sort of I don't think the user interface guy wants to touch it anymore . 
UNKNOWN Well I mean of course , I mean My my s my suggestion is we're gonna go go to the silvers and blacks like most of the televisions . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN You know some blend of silvers and blacks . 
UNKNOWN Beep beep beep . 
UNKNOWN Okay enough of that . 
UNKNOWN Well i it's cool guys . 
UNKNOWN 'Kay so are we done with the this presentation? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Ja . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Now now . 
UNKNOWN So you're not gonna find my uh my folder up there I gotta do mine up at the board . 
UNKNOWN Have you ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah yeah . 
UNKNOWN So No it's not in there because I had the computer problem and I I I cou I couldn't create it . 
UNKNOWN Can I not get your get at stuff from your shared folder now ? 
UNKNOWN Oh I see I see . 
UNKNOWN I couldn't create it in the PowerPoint, and I think I've got this really strange cable . 
UNKNOWN So what I had , basically going from the PowerPointformat , is that uh yeah yeah I like this a lot . 
UNKNOWN Is this one of the tests is to see how we can adapt to s changing situations in the in the meeting room ? 
UNKNOWN Nah . 
UNKNOWN So what we had is we had the method . 
UNKNOWN That's not how you spell method , is it ? 
UNKNOWN No way . 
UNKNOWN No A_ . 
UNKNOWN . 
UNKNOWN So this doesn't go so fast this way . 
UNKNOWN And when I speak about method I speak about the marketing of the product huh . 
UNKNOWN And uh to me with this product we got uh we got basically three things to market . 
UNKNOWN We've got the features , we have the uh characteristics , and we have the I I don't know what we would call the other part what we call you know the the the corp corporate Help me . 
UNKNOWN The the corporation stands behind the product , okay . 
UNKNOWN So the features I think we got the scroll , we've got the uh the locator , we've got the durability , we've got the dependability , we've got you know the features that make this a unique product . 
UNKNOWN It fell off . 
UNKNOWN Beep beep beep . 
UNKNOWN Um the characteristics I talk about , we have reliability , we have comfort , we have ergonomics , we have environmentally s sensitive . 
UNKNOWN Uh and the corporation , we're talking about we're we're a new we're a new company . 
UNKNOWN We're wanting to make a name for ourself . 
UNKNOWN We're wanting you to uh find our product so we're gonna give you a good product at a fair price . 
UNKNOWN One thing I would want to to see is uh is can we can we get a lifetime uh guarantee on this product , a normal use guarantee , which means that this product , for the for the life of of the life use , if it should have a technical problem , that we could re replace it at no cost ? 
UNKNOWN That was something I would be interested in . 
UNKNOWN Um so yeah without uh going into great details , we have a we have a product , it has the features and the characteristics , and the background , I believe , to make it marketable I believe at a cost of of of thirty thirty five to to fifty Euros . 
UNKNOWN We're gonna be competitive , and we're gonna we're gonna have a market niche . 
UNKNOWN Um w That that would be uh that would be I think a decision best made by corporate um I I m for my evaluation , based on what our competition is , I th I think that that we can go after this and and and go after more of the uh exclusivity sense than the mass market sense . 
UNKNOWN Do you would you a argue that that we're better going for the higher cost than bringing it down into twenty f five as we probably could , but lowering our profit margins ? 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Mm 'kay . 
UNKNOWN But I'm sh I'm sure open to to market this in either direction . 
UNKNOWN But you guys came up with a great product , and at that cost I think it uh there's nobody else that's putting this this combination of of ingredients together . 
UNKNOWN The only limitations I see to this is that we're focused on television only . 
UNKNOWN Uh that's the only that's the only drawback I see to this . 
UNKNOWN But with all of these other features I think people c one thing I'm I'm hoping for is people are not gonna even notice . 
UNKNOWN There's gonna be somebody going home and say oh sh this thing doesn't work for my D_V_D_ and my but I like these other things , so they keep it , they don't take it back . 
UNKNOWN And we're actually quite open to be able to expand the product for a later version with those features quite simply anyway , aren't we ? 
UNKNOWN Th there's no fundamentally different technology to do that . 
UNKNOWN Well one of one of the thoughts that I had is can can this unit be be produced in a way that makes it upgradable ? 
UNKNOWN You know uh like like a um a sim card in a in a um in a telephone . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN You know is there a card in th can we make a card and so after Mm-hmm , but you follow what I'm s I'm s Yeah 'cause if if we can make this unit upgradable then we're yeah but then we talk about changing the warranty concept and everything , but that's that was just an idea I had . 
UNKNOWN W we need we need we need s some more buttons if it would to work on some other stuff , but We we w yeah we could get another version of it that actually works . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN But uh Very co very colf colourful . 
UNKNOWN Uh to me the only additions Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , the plus there's the the risk of making it unusable as well , or making it less b because at the moment it's actually very straightforward to look at all the buttons , you know what they do , it's very simple , and it just works . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN Mm there's a risk of that . 
UNKNOWN But anyway that's uh Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Okay so we can talk about finance now . 
UNKNOWN So I have a little spreadsheetfor us where I I was wondering , you when you talked about the fifteen point eight Euros , I was wondering how you came up with that figure ? 
UNKNOWN Well , that was just just our technical team added up the um production costs of the individual units . 
UNKNOWN Okay so I have bit of a spreadsheethere for this . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN Now I've made a f few assumptions here in that I'm assuming that our power adaptor we can make for a cost of four Euros , equivalent to solar cells , which I think is probably fair considering that we have in-house manufacturing of power adaptors already . 
UNKNOWN Uh-huh . 
UNKNOWN Uh-huh . 
UNKNOWN Uh and I'm assuming that the locator beacon , the you know the Can be made for it sounded different that time uh can be made for a similar price to uh an L_C_ display , uh an uh Uh do you think that's fair coming from a m the manufacturing ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN beep beep beep . 
UNKNOWN Oh , sorry . 
UNKNOWN Yeah um I do think we that we we uh don't need the events chip on print, we only need the uh the regular chip on print, so there may have been a m miscalculation in there . 
UNKNOWN . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So we're down to sixteen point four , yeah . 
UNKNOWN And we and we have a single-curved uh Uh I think that It's single-curved , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Is that a single-curved rather than a double-curved ? 
UNKNOWN We're not entirely sure what single-curve versus double-cur You think ? 
UNKNOWN We've got a we've got a curve and a droop . 
UNKNOWN I don't know whether that . 
UNKNOWN Okay I'm convinced . 
UNKNOWN But we save one Euro that way , yeah ? 
UNKNOWN So we come bring it down to Fifteen point four . 
UNKNOWN See it's a little bit more than f single-curved . 
UNKNOWN So yeah it's fifteen point eight , that's where we came up with it . 
UNKNOWN Well hang on . 
UNKNOWN Do don't speak so it's in here , in that w do we have any we have special form don't we ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah we do . 
UNKNOWN So that's yeah . 
UNKNOWN Ah . 
UNKNOWN But the the the we haven't talked about any special colour though uh I don't th if we're going for greys and silvers then I don't think we're O okay so we're Push-button , scroll wheel , we're basically we have uh th is this intended to be a button as well or just a scroll ? 
UNKNOWN What do you know . 
UNKNOWN Oh it's a that's not very special , it's pretty If th . 
UNKNOWN We don't It's a scroll . 
UNKNOWN That's a scroll . 
UNKNOWN Just a scroll ? 
UNKNOWN It's not one of the scrolls where , for example , with this one you could push it down to be a button ? 
UNKNOWN Uh no we just use it as a scroll . 
UNKNOWN Ooh . 
UNKNOWN Okay then we have fifteen point eight Euros . 
UNKNOWN It was a pretty accurate estimate I would say . 
UNKNOWN It wasn't bad . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN We're wicked . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Awesome . 
UNKNOWN Okay so we're on to the We're on to the pat-on-the-back part of the presentation, where we have a look at the criterias th that Paul the criterion criteria that Paul has has given us , and we can use that to tell How's it going ? 
UNKNOWN S 's kind of s frighteningly accurate . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Anyone got any thoughts ? 
UNKNOWN What ? 
UNKNOWN How how have we done today ? 
UNKNOWN I think we did pretty well . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think we did pretty well too . 
UNKNOWN That looks pretty spectacular . 
UNKNOWN No , I think we come up with a with a attractive marketable um product and and concept . 
UNKNOWN Any other chang uh thoughts ? 
UNKNOWN Okay so th th what about um room for creativity ? 
UNKNOWN That was mm-hmm Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Is it the . 
UNKNOWN Sh I think there was plenty of room . 
UNKNOWN I I think we we ended up being quite creative there . 
UNKNOWN We got a couple innovative i Couple innovative ideas . 
UNKNOWN Yeah well we we we kinda broke we kinda at least adjusted every every criteria they gave us because we d we still have the the teletext capability in this thing right , we raised the price of it , we've added two t new technology to it . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
NEGATION No . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So you know you know if this thing flies then we've we've adjusted or broken every every idea they gave us . 
UNKNOWN Not every idea necessarily , it's still a remote control . 
UNKNOWN Basically . 
UNKNOWN Yeah yeah yeah yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh no yeah but we did we did break with the specs a little bit I guess , but the uh 'Kay leadership , what do we reportback to the bosses ? 
UNKNOWN But I like I mean when I say we have we had I believe we have room for creativity 'cause w this is we did it . 
UNKNOWN No th th I think they were r reasonably flexible with us over the whole changing the specs thing . 
UNKNOWN It was more of a teamwork thing then really leadership based project was Teamwork . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN I agree . 
UNKNOWN Cohesive yeah . 
UNKNOWN Synergy . 
UNKNOWN Yes synergistic yeah . 
UNKNOWN There was a lot of synergy . 
UNKNOWN Teamwork , yeah he is uh . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN What did we think of the meeting room , I guess is an important thing here . 
UNKNOWN These cables suck . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , this falls off and uh the white board worked really well without any pro Mm-mm , lapel . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN And that's D you must have very long shirts . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN That's way far down lapel mic . 
UNKNOWN Wha okay , oh , alright . 
UNKNOWN Lapel lapel lapel . 
UNKNOWN Lapel . 
UNKNOWN That's almost a crotch mi cr Oh dear oh dear . 
UNKNOWN That's it's down , it's quite close . 
UNKNOWN You know you know what they're gonna have on the recording in there from that microphone is your lunch digesting you know th New ideas f uh for the product or for the the the the environment or what are we ta Oh . 
UNKNOWN Keep it , keep it calm . 
UNKNOWN Oh dear . 
UNKNOWN No more pizza for me . 
UNKNOWN So yeah the the pen came in alright and it's a little uncomfortable to use but I guess it works . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause this is you were using it o upside down . 
UNKNOWN Still that Use them like that . 
UNKNOWN That's our boss . 
UNKNOWN Nah , I'm I'm not convinced of that at all . 
UNKNOWN I've been wor I've been wondering about that all day , but see these look like they're that looks the oth that looks like it would be that way around , but it feels more comfortable , wh what you call upside-down . 
UNKNOWN Pedro's right . 
UNKNOWN Pedro's right . 
UNKNOWN I don't care . 
UNKNOWN Uh okay so that data might be slightly invalid . 
UNKNOWN What new ideas have we found ? 
UNKNOWN Oh wel Well we had the favourites list , and the scroll bar , and we have the cradle , and the r uh remote call feature . 
UNKNOWN Well let's do both then . 
UNKNOWN Uh for the product ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah we came up with quite a bit . 
UNKNOWN Bunch of new ideas . 
UNKNOWN And for the meeting room , Has anyone got any more Yeah less sore on the ears . 
UNKNOWN Yeah comfortable headsets would be nice . 
UNKNOWN Well I I mean clearly remote control microphones would be the would be a nice solution to all these cables , but I'm sure that there's there's some justification for these things that I don't know about . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN And of course I did not have so much fun with my computer this afternoon . 
UNKNOWN It's not been uh it's not been cooperating so well , but I don't think that's the that's avoidable . 
UNKNOWN Coulda been worse . 
UNKNOWN Okay so Are the costs within the budget ? 
UNKNOWN Mm n no . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN Nope . 
UNKNOWN Oh hang on it really that's something we that the costs were under twelve fifty Euros . 
UNKNOWN No requirements are changed . 
UNKNOWN We're still under twenty Euros to build , so we're good . 
UNKNOWN And the costs within the budget ? 
UNKNOWN Not the original budget , but they are now . 
UNKNOWN Is the project evaluated ? 
UNKNOWN Mm I think so yeah , then celebration as it says . 
UNKNOWN Hooray . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Free coke provided at the cafeteria . 
UNKNOWN All right . 
UNKNOWN Oh I don't know how that got there . 
UNKNOWN Uh anyway . 
UNKNOWN Who wrote that one ? 
UNKNOWN Thank Thanks guys . 
UNKNOWN So we need to close this meeting , yeah bravo . 
UNKNOWN Congratulations . 
CONFIRMATION Cool . 
UNKNOWN Good job guys . 
UNKNOWN S I've got a lot of paperwork to catch up on so let's close this and come back and 'kay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I've got a lot of paperwork to catch up on too . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN So we can start ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Suppose I have to do my presentation. 
UNKNOWN Ah okay . 
UNKNOWN Eh um So , I'll present myself , I'm Ada Longmund , and as you may know it , I'm the pr project manager . 
UNKNOWN It's Ada Longmund ? 
UNKNOWN So um we will have to um speak about m the project . 
UNKNOWN Our project project is to create um a new remote control and as you may know there's lot of industrials interesting in creating a remote control , so the remote control has to be original , trendy and um user-friendly . 
UNKNOWN Record . 
UNKNOWN So the project method is the following . 
UNKNOWN So if we're um the functional design , you have to do uh any individual work and uh also work with uh meetings talking with each other . 
UNKNOWN Uh it will be the same for the conceptual design and also the same for the detailed design . 
CONFUSION Uh . 
UNKNOWN The tool training is to try out the white board , so Maybe you can drawyour favourite animal and make a list of its favourite characteristics . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Maybe someone ha we have to this whiteboard , yeah ? 
UNKNOWN So right now ? 
UNKNOWN I don't know if we have to do it now , maybe later later . 
UNKNOWN So yeah I think you can do it . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I don't know . 
UNKNOWN So the selling price of the product will be twenty five Euros . 
UNKNOWN Twenty five Euros ? 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think it's quite good price , yeah . 
UNKNOWN I it's it's reasonable , s quite yeah . 
UNKNOWN It's reasonable , I think , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Twenty five . 
UNKNOWN And uh it will uh be a an international remote control , as we want to sell it in the entire world , and the product costs will be not more than twelve Euros and fifty centimes . 
UNKNOWN Is Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So , as you will discuss about the remote control you will have to experience your um with the remote control . 
UNKNOWN Um just uh maybe be imaginative with remote const con controls , try to create something new and people would like to to buy . 
UNKNOWN And and the next meeting will start in thirty minutes , so you'll ha all have your spethisfispis specif specific role and you know I suppose you know what you have to do . 
UNKNOWN And uh you will have to work on the design and also to work on the design of th technical fun functions of the remote control and think of the user requirement specifications . 
UNKNOWN I I hope so I_D_ is for the Industrial Design , yeah ? 
UNKNOWN Those things just refer to each of each of us , I think . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN AMI and okay . 
UNKNOWN I_D_ , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So So I will manage all all the group . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN And U_I_D_ , it's for the User Interface Designer , yeah ? 
UNKNOWN That's me . 
UNKNOWN Okay , and Marketing Expert , it's me . 
UNKNOWN AMI yeah project . 
UNKNOWN you will be the manager yeah . 
UNKNOWN You can manage all this , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Good . 
UNKNOWN So you have questions ? 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Not really . 
UNKNOWN So you all know what the parts of the work you have to do . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So which you , the Industrial Designer . 
UNKNOWN No I'm user interf I'm user interface design . 
UNKNOWN I am the Industrial Design , yeah I am the Industrial Designer so . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN And you ? 
UNKNOWN Mm okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So what's the difference between user interface design d industrial design ? 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN I mean , you have to know . 
UNKNOWN Ah , you have to know it . 
UNKNOWN It's difficult . 
UNKNOWN It's your job , so I hope you you know what it is . 
UNKNOWN You know very soon . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , I think so . 
UNKNOWN So I I think the user the user interface design is he will design how the user will you know the relation between the user and you know the remote control so And the uh industrial design , it is how the object will look like . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN I suppose you have to design it and you have to take care of the industrial way to transform it . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so I make uh u user interface . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN You you de you implement the core functions in the Use it . 
UNKNOWN And i maybe you will transform it . 
UNKNOWN Make make yeah . 
UNKNOWN Maybe I think uh uh i industrial design's uh , it's the function design . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So the materi Okay right . 
UNKNOWN I design the user f user interface , you design the function . 
UNKNOWN Maybe , it is the outside and the inside . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN But I was thinking that he's a user 'cause the user interface to design for example where the but button will be , you know . 
UNKNOWN Yeah yeah . 
UNKNOWN But I don't know . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Well . 
UNKNOWN You know . 
UNKNOWN I'm the industrial designer . 
CONFIRMATION Oh , okay , okay . 
UNKNOWN Not the other one . 
UNKNOWN So . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So and the marketing expert will Ok Okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I'm just go I'm trying to give you some trends about what should be done and what the users would like to have and then thi this would I guess converged to the User Interface Designer wi and then Industrial Designer . 
UNKNOWN And yeah . 
UNKNOWN And when designing y the remote control just remember that uh it has to be a kind of international product . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So you don't have to do something really specific , as everybody everybody will have to use it , it's sor the same as keyboards . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN You know , you have Qwerty , Azerty , French and U_K_ keyboard , so really the remote control to be international . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN And not too expensive . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And uh simple . 
UNKNOWN As we want to maximise the benefit . 
UNKNOWN And easy to use . 
UNKNOWN And you have to keep it under twelve Euros and f fifty , so . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , you have to keep in mind that the product cost won't be maxim more than twelve dot fifty Euros . 
UNKNOWN Ah , yeah . 
UNKNOWN That's the problem . 
UNKNOWN It should be There was a step about drawingsomething in the in the board , I don't know . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN And to be sure that really people will be interested in buying a new remote control with maybe new functionalities that don't exist in the mm existing remote controls now . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So , is it okay ? 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It's clear . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , maybe should go and drawan animal . 
UNKNOWN Is it ? 
UNKNOWN Are we supposed to do right now ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah yeah , you try . 
UNKNOWN Try first . 
UNKNOWN Oh right it's it's from the left to the ri It's I d I was thinking but I n I'm not sure now . 
UNKNOWN So you think we have to do it now ? 
UNKNOWN You can drawsomething which is very simple . 
UNKNOWN Oh Everybody I think everybody should do it , so . 
UNKNOWN You want me to drawsomething ? 
UNKNOWN Product manager okay , let's go , I will try . 
UNKNOWN Oh , maybe we should bring Kemy here . 
UNKNOWN Kemy is really good at drawing. 
UNKNOWN Many Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It's not matter So . 
UNKNOWN You're going to draw? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Uh it's the same as mine . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It's a It's a cat . 
UNKNOWN What's this ? 
UNKNOWN It's a fat cat . 
UNKNOWN It is not a fat cat . 
UNKNOWN It's the fat cat , okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , it is a Yes you have to drawa rat if you want a rat . 
UNKNOWN Can you drawuh um rabbit ? 
UNKNOWN Oh , hat ha rat . 
UNKNOWN A rat ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN That's difficult . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN A mouse is not too difficult . 
UNKNOWN It's your rat . 
UNKNOWN Mouse is okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , it's okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Just go , you you the closest to the whiteboard . 
UNKNOWN Okay , go right , but in grow , it's everybody has to grow What are you I don no idea , so It's a rabbit . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Jus Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN Okay , I draw. 
UNKNOWN The only thing I can drawis like this . 
SURPRISE Oh .
SURPRISE Oh .
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN A duck . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN What's this ? 
UNKNOWN You love the eyes . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that was the eyes . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN A clown . 
UNKNOWN Rabbit . 
UNKNOWN Pikachu . 
UNKNOWN It's a rabbit . 
UNKNOWN Oh yeah . 
UNKNOWN Bugs Bunny one . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN It's not so bad so . 
UNKNOWN The only thing I can draw, because it's very simple . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN I go . 
UNKNOWN What ? 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN So what else ? 
UNKNOWN This was my favourite one , but Right . 
UNKNOWN So you don't have a A fish . 
THANKS Thank you . 
UNKNOWN A fish . 
UNKNOWN That's a that's a fish ? 
UNKNOWN Okay , let's try to drawsomething . 
UNKNOWN You forgot the chips . 
UNKNOWN Oh yeah , doesn't look so fine . 
UNKNOWN Have to be really careful . 
UNKNOWN Fish and chips . 
UNKNOWN Okay , it's your turn . 
UNKNOWN Ah it's my turn . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN Okay , be careful . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So . 
UNKNOWN Of Oh . 
UNKNOWN No problem , no problem . 
UNKNOWN It's ok So , what can I drawsome more ? 
UNKNOWN ? 
UNKNOWN ? 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN Mm Yeah , it's it's a se it's my priority this one . 
UNKNOWN . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN A person ? 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN It's a really crazy dog Okay . 
UNKNOWN Dog . 
UNKNOWN Oh yeah . 
UNKNOWN Good . 
UNKNOWN Transfer . 
UNKNOWN It's a dog in a village . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So what are you sug going to do now ? 
UNKNOWN I think it's done . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I think yeah . 
UNKNOWN It's done ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Just have to present project , discuss a little bit about it . 
UNKNOWN So we have break . 
UNKNOWN Oh my God . 
UNKNOWN Oh , we have twenty five minutes for the meeting . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So , if you have questions . 
SURPRISE Oh .
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Know what time is it ? 
NEGATION No . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN It's okay ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , it's okay . 
UNKNOWN You know your job ? 
UNKNOWN you know your job ? 
UNKNOWN We have an idea yeah . 
UNKNOWN You know your job ? 
UNKNOWN I have an idea of my job so yeah so . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Good . 
UNKNOWN So , I will open our functional design meeting . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So , I will play role of the secretary . 
UNKNOWN As also Program Ma Manager . 
UNKNOWN So , we will have the three presentationsfrom the In Industrial Designer , User Interface Designer and um What's your talk ? 
UNKNOWN Industrial Design . 
UNKNOWN Marketing Expert . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Marketing Experts . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN And after that we uh will have the uh new product requirements , the decision on the remote control functions , and we will close the meetings after . 
UNKNOWN Mm so um I suppose the first to do the presentationwill be the User Interface Designer . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um , so you're participant two ? 
UNKNOWN One one . 
UNKNOWN No no no . 
UNKNOWN No you're No , I'm participant one . 
UNKNOWN One . 
UNKNOWN Three three , it's three sorry . 
UNKNOWN I I think I'm a . 
UNKNOWN Okay , never mind . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN 'Kay , did you save your presentation? 
UNKNOWN In one . 
UNKNOWN In one , sorry . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Isn't that technical functions ? 
UNKNOWN No sure . 
UNKNOWN So you didn't save it maybe . 
UNKNOWN It's mine . 
UNKNOWN Uh it's David Jordan . 
UNKNOWN Alright , so David Jordan ? 
UNKNOWN Name's Jordan . 
UNKNOWN Course . 
UNKNOWN So so I'll I let David Jordan do his presentation. 
UNKNOWN Mm yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN No , no . 
UNKNOWN Uh this one doesn't want to be moved , I think . 
CONFUSION Uh . 
UNKNOWN Too great for emailthen . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so . 
UNKNOWN The first I will present the technical function design for user interface for our uh remote T_V_ control . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh I I will focus on user interface design . 
UNKNOWN Um so move to the next slide. 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN As we know our remote c rem remote T_V_ control it's very has very soph sophisticated functions , as we show from this picture . 
UNKNOWN There's a lot of functions . 
UNKNOWN Over , I think over s twelve or twenty s functions of a remote T_V_ control . 
UNKNOWN So how can we um design a user interface with so sa with so many sophisticated functions ? 
UNKNOWN Um , let's move to next slide. 
CONFUSION Um . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So I so we want to design uh elegant , easy to use inter interface . 
UNKNOWN A very good example is Google . 
UNKNOWN As we know uh Google it's a very successful because his um powerful function , but with very easy to use user interface . 
UNKNOWN Um so move to next s slide. 
UNKNOWN So my job is to uh design a Google T_V_ controller which I want to have sophisticated functions while with very easy to use user interface . 
UNKNOWN So That's the end of the talk the end of the presentation. 
UNKNOWN So you propose to to have the remote control which will be powerful . 
UNKNOWN Uh With sophisticated functions , but with very yeah powerful . 
UNKNOWN So powerful , many functions and very easy to use . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN So , I dunno , it's maybe difficult to have both , I mean the the one on the right doesn't look so simple and Yeah . 
UNKNOWN To merge the two system huh . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN You mean this one ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah you have to learn the manual before using this remote control , I suppose . 
UNKNOWN Mm yep . 
UNKNOWN But if we have very very good user interface it take less time for user to learn how to use it . 
UNKNOWN But But this is Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , and then Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah you maybe you have some international standards , where you know , if you can use one is the other are or almost the same , so the sign . 
UNKNOWN Oh you mean for the yeah pic pictograms or things like that ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah . 
UNKNOWN For example , I dunno here , escape , you know , you have escape in computers you have , so if you see escape , you know that it should be the same . 
UNKNOWN Oh it should okay , yeah . 
UNKNOWN So you have to The sh the user there for example the power off button it is something very international , you know that So . 
UNKNOWN The user should know . 
UNKNOWN Yeah um such as maybe the Go on , go back and So , you will propose us something which is yeah so powerful and easy to use . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but the question is how to merge you know the Google system to the system , alright . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's gonna be the trick . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's my job . 
UNKNOWN That's your job It you Okay , okay . 
UNKNOWN That's my job . 
UNKNOWN It's not the easiest I've got to . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Powerful and easy to use . 
UNKNOWN So that's the point . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's the point . 
UNKNOWN So , next I propose the Industrial User Interface to present things . 
UNKNOWN So you you're Um . 
UNKNOWN Participant two . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN The rationale must be design , or So we can move to the next slide. 
UNKNOWN So , Baba is the uh the Industrial Designer . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN As you all know , you know m my job is to design you know uh to give an industrial design of the remote control . 
UNKNOWN So the re basically the remote control will be , you know , infrared control , so the problem is how to relate the how to relate the remote control device , like for example this one I h I'm holding in my hand and the T_V_ . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So , this one is leather bu based but I propose a nifra infrared base you know , so so for me I think that it is better it's bet it's better to control T_V_ so you know , so it's it will be cheaper and it is less technology than , you know For the cheap price we have , for the cheap price we want to I think it's cheaper than laser , so . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN True . 
UNKNOWN So you mean that infrared control is a cheap technology ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Do y you know the requirements for the remote control ? 
UNKNOWN Twelve , nearly thirteen , yeah . 
UNKNOWN What the cost is ? 
UNKNOWN The cost Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I think for the cost we want for the cost we want it's better to have uh uh Let's see . 
UNKNOWN Twelve , twelve a half . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN You can move to the next slide, so . 
UNKNOWN So the di the differen the findings you know what you find inside the re i the the system here inside it is just , you know a bulb and an infrared bulb , so here for example the infrared bulb will be here and the bulb it will be somewhere inside . 
UNKNOWN That might just So . 
UNKNOWN You can go to the next slide. 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN I have some kind of pictures you know , here . 
UNKNOWN You have the b the bulb , it is a blue the blue stuff here and the infrared and the infrared bulb it is the red stuff you know and so and you have the other subcomponent that are not really here so important , so . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN What is this ? 
UNKNOWN This is in fact some other component that are in between the electrical de the electronic device . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Look . 
UNKNOWN But here what I wanted to emphasise it is just you know the bulb and . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So and the next slide, it is the last one it's So it's I think it should be wire wireless re remote con Because you know , it's easier to manage and you know because you f the b the the battery problem can hold you know will you use a battery or the a wire to connected you . 
UNKNOWN Or maybe some kind of thing that we can have both , but you know , I at my side prefer a wireless . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so if you have some question I didn't answer ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN What's the average price of this technology then ? 
UNKNOWN Well the avera the average prices I think that this technology will cost , I dunno , around eight Euros , so . 
UNKNOWN Or at least you know , the You'd yes , you can . 
UNKNOWN So what , the wireless remote control ? 
UNKNOWN There's a wire with remote control ? 
UNKNOWN It's so so bres you have to decide how how you will you know , put some energy inside , so you can think about wireless or you know it's it's a question that we can raise , so . 
UNKNOWN We can think that you know , with the wire , you know , without a wire . 
UNKNOWN We can have both also . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So you think that uh a cable between the remote control and the T_V_ won't be a good idea . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN No it wou maybe it will be cheaper I dunno , I just may maybe you making a solu Yeah , but Yeah but as Industrial Designer , do you think that it will be feasible to have uh linked or to have link between the remote control and the television ? 
UNKNOWN But this is what you would like to ask the user first and I don't think the user would be ready to have a I don't think well , yeah , I don't think he would , but in a sense The wire ? 
UNKNOWN Wireless remote control . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but some pa I always want to have you know , sometime I want to have wire because you know . 
UNKNOWN I'm just asking you . 
UNKNOWN Do you think it will be cheaper ? 
UNKNOWN Uh , I don't think it will be too much . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Could you answer please ? 
UNKNOWN Have to think about the question , you know , 'cause it's I think that you know you can always you know I think wha wha with the wire it's mm cheaper but you know the wireless it's more practical , so . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but I think the wireless problem is more the um David Jordan's problem . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN As it's yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN True . 
CONFIRMATION Okay , yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think it's more your problem . 
UNKNOWN Mayb maybe you have just to to kind of research or try to ask people if they will like something wireless or not . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Uh that's my job . 
UNKNOWN That's the Now the Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay , I'm sorry . 
UNKNOWN So So just think of um the usability . 
UNKNOWN Yeah but , it should be an agreement , you know , because even if you can think of the wireless , it is it's it is the job of the the the g Graphical User Designer , but you know . 
UNKNOWN If it is a lot cheaper and if you want to reach for example some the the money you have , if you want to use , so it can be good to have a wireless , it it is a question . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Right , so . 
UNKNOWN Design a wireless remote control . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Just think of the problem . 
UNKNOWN If when you have wireless remote control and if you lose it ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think it's would be easier to have a link between the remote control and the television , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well that's actually one of the point , yeah ? 
UNKNOWN True . 
UNKNOWN This you will see in my presentationthen . 
UNKNOWN So I will let you to do your presentation, so . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Which is participant four . 
UNKNOWN So just trying to answer all the questions , if the user would be happy to have something or something else uh . 
UNKNOWN We've made a study , so could you go to next slide. 
UNKNOWN Sorry for the functional recurrence . 
UNKNOWN So that's the standard method for marketing , okay . 
UNKNOWN We had one hundred subjects , um , we observe their remote control use in a lab and then after all the experiments they had to fill up a questionnaire , um , and see what was okay or not for them . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So then it's some statistics about what we observed and what they answered . 
UNKNOWN Um actually seventy five percent of the users find m the most remote controls uh ugly , okay , so that's Yeah , the the look is is bad for them so uh it's your job , David , maybe . 
UNKNOWN You mean the loo the look , the outside ? 
UNKNOWN The look , how it look like . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Then eighty percent of users would spend more money um actually if if the remote controls were not so ugly . 
UNKNOWN So this is where we could have uh yeah , good market , I guess , if people are ready to pay more . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So it's it's interesting information , I think . 
UNKNOWN And then um yeah , the remote controls like the one you've shown previously it's not so doesn't fit the user requirements sometime , because it's too many buttons and so on . 
UNKNOWN So we should change this as well . 
UNKNOWN And uh users are actually zapping a lot , so they're using the device intensively , that's something to take into account as well . 
UNKNOWN And um , you know , ten percent of the buttons are actually used in the remote control . 
UNKNOWN And uh this is one of the main point for me . 
UNKNOWN But I'll come back to it later . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN Could you go next slide? 
UNKNOWN Uh , so as you said uh , remote controls are often lost somewhere in the room . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So this is from the experiments we've done , so if we could solve this problem this would be interesting for the user , I think . 
UNKNOWN Um it takes too much time to learn how to use the remote control for thirty five percent of the people . 
UNKNOWN And uh remote control are really bad for R_S_I_ problems for twenty six percent of the users . 
UNKNOWN What is R_S_I_ ? 
UNKNOWN R_S_I_ is like , when you're using the same um doing the same movement several times , then you get injured . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Ah um okay . 
UNKNOWN Okay ? 
UNKNOWN So , those numbers are less important then the previous one , but still it has to be taken to count . 
UNKNOWN So last slide. 
UNKNOWN Um so my pres personal preferences for this problem is we have to meet the user needs . 
UNKNOWN If we can make it look fancy then we might sell more than our uh concurrent , okay . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN And definitely if it could have less buttons , still maybe the same number of um functions , but less buttons , this would definitely be a good way of selling more . 
UNKNOWN Functions . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So Yeah , remember the user is not happy to read the manual . 
UNKNOWN Mm okay . 
UNKNOWN And just to have uh an idea , do you think you as the User Interface Designer to would it be possible to have less buttons and still have the same functionality and to have powerful remote control , you think it's possible ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Sure ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I think possible . 
UNKNOWN Yeah ? 
UNKNOWN Because we can We can uh mix uh several function in one button . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So lets you then you have less buttons . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but do you think it will be easy to use ? 
UNKNOWN But I'm not sure No you you can have a switch menu , so you can well for example Yeah , I think so . 
UNKNOWN Because if you have many functions just for one button it would be quite difficult for the user to know . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I think the Yeah , but it has to be intuitive . 
UNKNOWN The manuals . 
UNKNOWN It's Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Like for for example you can uh you can category the function i i into several classes . 
UNKNOWN Then for um you can have a switch menu , so you put the switch menu to it it tend to this kind of this category of functions . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , okay . 
UNKNOWN Okay , but Yeah , but Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Then you you put the switch button , then it switch to another category of functions . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN For example , if you have remote control you you can rem you can control your T_V_ and also you can control your uh recorder . 
UNKNOWN With a Look fancy . 
UNKNOWN So there's a different functions , but i if you you there's a button you can switch between control T_V_ and control your recorder . 
UNKNOWN So we can has less buttons . 
UNKNOWN But what I'm not so sure is about how to make the remote control look funny look fancy , not funny . 
UNKNOWN This is a question that should be asked to the If you ask the people , maybe the the marketing people . 
UNKNOWN Because different people have a different opinion about fancy . 
UNKNOWN You know . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , this is something we sh But this was first step and This was the first step , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Because maybe a colourful is fancy for some people , but maybe simple and uh uniform colourful is fancy for some for other peoples , so . 
UNKNOWN I think the solution is to have many colours of you know instead of having one grey standard Yeah , yeah , maybe . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but I think it will increase the price of the production of the remote control . 
UNKNOWN Specially distribution , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , maybe . 
UNKNOWN If you need to have special colours for remote controls it will cost more . 
UNKNOWN Uh Yeah , but this is what we would ask to the users , so . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , personalised colour . 
UNKNOWN Because you know Yeah , because maybe some people prefer a red remote control , some people prefer black remote control . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , it will cost little bit more . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah , yeah . 
UNKNOWN And also f Yeah , but as soon as you speak about options , it means that the price increases , and we don't really want the price to be too too high , because we wanna be able to produce it . 
UNKNOWN Maybe we can have di di we can have uh several options , so user can select which colour they prefer , so . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , remember it's twelve Euros . 
UNKNOWN So , we want something fancy , as uh previously said , Florent , something very easy to use , powerful and also as uh it's written here , seventy five percent of users , they zap lot , so maybe just having many functions in one button is not that good if you want to zap a lot . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN And they don't really want to zap between functions of their remote control , they want to zap between channels on T_V_ . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So I think you have quite lot of points to to think about and to discuss it with uh the other members . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , hmm . 
UNKNOWN So , is it okay for your presentation? 
UNKNOWN Nothing else to to add ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , it's done , just yeah . 
UNKNOWN If we would if we could remember like , not too many buttons and make it look fancy , I think it would make it . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Mm so So , I had some new information about the product requirements , so you will have to take care of it of it in your thinking , in your designing of the remote control . 
UNKNOWN So . 
UNKNOWN So the first one is that um for the designing of the remote control we don't really want to use the teletext anymore , as it's something that's It's is uh No yeah , because now everybody has internet at home , so it's better to use internet then teletext . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Lame , or Mm-hmm Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So , you will have to think about it in your in in the design of your remote control , and also the remote control will only be used for television , so for y for you your designing , you're not you won't be uh you won't had um buttons to just to manipulate yeah to control the recorder or maybe the garage door or things like that . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN Control . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN It's because if we want to to do remote control which will be used for for the television , for the recorder , for the camcorder and all the others , it will become too complex and it will increase the pli the price and we can't do that . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN We really want to focus on the remote control for the television . 
UNKNOWN Is it okay ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN But there's balance between function and the cost . 
UNKNOWN So maybe it will be easier for you to to design it , to have very powerful and easy . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN And also we want the image of the uh um real reaction be recognisable in the product , such as the colour and s the slogan . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN I mean that's uh if uh you want to buy a remote control and if you go in a shop and if you see the remote control you will recognise directly that s it's our product . 
UNKNOWN Mm-hm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So you will have to use the colour of the product , of the um um of the uh of real reaction and uh also Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So . 
UNKNOWN So has to be yellow . 
UNKNOWN Yellow . 
UNKNOWN As we say , we put the fashion in electronics , so it has to be a fashion remote control . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Fancy , fashion , powerful , easy to use . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Require lot of requirements , but Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN For cheap remote control , yeah . 
UNKNOWN And cheap . 
UNKNOWN A low cost . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But uh that's your your job to find something mm matches . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , 'cause what I'm thinking is how will you will connect the T_V_ to internet , so . 
UNKNOWN This is Yeah , but this this mean that your T_V_ would be able to , you know , connect to internet , you know , surf the web . 
UNKNOWN I don't think it's part of the remote control design anyway . 
UNKNOWN Maybe not , but mayb So . 
UNKNOWN It's maybe more in browsing . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , there's that box in uh o of it . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN A pi There's that box in the T_V_ , so with the set box you you can connect internet with your T_V_ . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Ok It's It's not so uh popular now . 
UNKNOWN Hm-mm . 
UNKNOWN It's pop I don't think it's popular , so that's the problem so . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN You had i if you are designing a remote control for you know the global usage , so if people don't have the technology . 
UNKNOWN Global , okay . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So everybody is okay with the new requirements ? 
UNKNOWN So I I so As as for the colour , what what do you think ? 
UNKNOWN I think it has to be yellow . 
UNKNOWN Yellow ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Do you think that people like the colour yellow ? 
UNKNOWN Yellow ? 
UNKNOWN T_V_ remote control ? 
UNKNOWN Min Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Maybe you can change the colour , but the image of the society has to be recognised . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN I think if you have you know th like a yellow ribbon here is the double R_ . 
UNKNOWN Why you go It has to be fashion . 
UNKNOWN Or should be . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , so . 
UNKNOWN Doesn't need to be completely yellow , but just mm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So you have to Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It has to be a fashion and really be uh the image of the society . 
UNKNOWN Just when you enter you say oh , oh , it's real reaction . 
UNKNOWN Think it's a re reaction remote control , so . 
UNKNOWN Okay , okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN And also it has to be attractive , of course , because if you want to sale to sell the remote control . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN It's okay ? 
UNKNOWN Regarding the first line , what So we're just expecting no more use of the teletext . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And that's it . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But I dunno , but why , nobody's a threat to me . 
UNKNOWN It's already changed for Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN I think it would be simpler . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So I will close the meeting , um just after that we'll have lunch break . 
UNKNOWN And you will have in thirty minutes individual work . 
UNKNOWN Uh Y you You will have as the I_D_ I don't remember what is industr Industrial Designer to put um pon yeah , and the User Interface Designer to work on the user interface concept . 
UNKNOWN Industrial Designer , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Industrial Designer . 
UNKNOWN Component component , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN And Florent to work my subject . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN And so specific instructions will be sent to you by your personal coach . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN It's okay ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think the um session is closed . 
UNKNOWN Good . 
UNKNOWN And by the way , Mister David Jordan , please record your presentationsin your own folder . 
UNKNOWN Okay Okay , that's clear . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Not in mine . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Should be better . 
UNKNOWN So let's start our second me meeting on conceptual design . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So , as the previous meeting I will be the secretary and we will have three presentationsand we'll have to decide on the remote control concept and finally we'll close the decision . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So I will first uh What ? 
UNKNOWN No y you do the minutesfirst , or ? 
UNKNOWN No ? 
UNKNOWN I I think I will let uh our User Interface Designer speak first , Mister David Jordan . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN So , we'll S technical accessoire ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN No no no . 
UNKNOWN Interface ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN This . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN So uh first I will present the concept of user interface . 
UNKNOWN Um there's three concepts in the user interface . 
UNKNOWN So first one it's a Google controller . 
UNKNOWN The second is a fancy controller . 
UNKNOWN The last one is uh intelligent controller . 
UNKNOWN So there are three concepts in our controller . 
UNKNOWN Um n next I will explain one by one , the first is Google controller . 
UNKNOWN Um , so I want the controller to be easy to use , but with sophisticated functions . 
UNKNOWN So it's a combination of easy to use and um sophisticated functions . 
UNKNOWN Uh this is a first concept of our controller . 
UNKNOWN The second concept is a fancy controller , um so we want give the customers the impression that our controller is very attractive , um they can easy recognise our controller among a lot of products , so so the u the user f the the u user interface should be very very cute , very very g um attractive . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN A nice one . 
UNKNOWN Such like this , there are several uh examples in the slides. 
UNKNOWN I'm not sure the one in the middle is very attractive . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , it's very , you know if you're Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It's very big , yeah . 
UNKNOWN It's hard f i it's easy for you to remember it . 
UNKNOWN Or to recognise it , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , why not . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN We'll have big discussion I suppose after that , so . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN So the last uh concept is intelligent . 
UNKNOWN We want uh we want our controller to be smart , so maybe we should uh use um uh technology , such as speech recognition technology and gesture recognition technology , so we need to have coop some cooperation with some research institute on speech recognition and um gesture recognition . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Um With this advanced features we I think we can attract a lot of user . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Something else ? 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN There this is the three concepts of our controller . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I just have one question , because for the intelligent controller , you said that we can use the voice recognition or the gesture recognition , but as the um expert told us , most of the people want to use the remote control to zap t to zap between channels . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , so Y Uh I think some time it's very uh convenient to use voice interface and gesture interface than use button . 
UNKNOWN Do you think they will be able to use gestures ? 
UNKNOWN Because , if they do all the time the same gesture , as you said previously in the last meeting , maybe they will get injuries because of that ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN or if you say channel three channel three two three four six five , I think they will be bored after a while . 
CONFUSION Maybe . 
UNKNOWN You don't think so ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , sure . 
UNKNOWN For example , if you cannot find your uh controller , you can just uh just just uh speak something such as , yeah , one two . 
UNKNOWN I That's true . 
UNKNOWN Oh yeah , that's a good that's a good point , so . 
UNKNOWN One and Yep . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but suppose you got a cold . 
UNKNOWN You have a mute remote controller . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN So you can use your gesture . 
UNKNOWN That's no problem . 
UNKNOWN Yeah but how how is how risky is it to trust like speech recognition or gesture recognition ? 
UNKNOWN Broken arm ? 
UNKNOWN For limited vocabulary speech recognition is very reliable and for s limited vocabulary gesture recognition is also very Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but suppose you have a family watching T_V_ , and if they want to use their private remote control in the same time , do you think it will work ? 
UNKNOWN Everybody wanting to change channel in the same time ? 
UNKNOWN But this this but this would never happen anyway . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , they cannot speak at the same time . 
UNKNOWN Why ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah Yeah , but the Yeah but this Yeah . 
UNKNOWN If you have one brother and one sister and they want to watch their favourite uh T_V_ programme , so they say oh channel four channel three channel four channel three all the time , so . 
UNKNOWN Yeah but Yeah but the same can happen even with it you know this kind of remote control because the That's right . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , it's very interesting . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I don't think it Oh , okay , okay , you mean it could be a problem for this kind of stuff . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but you have the remote control , so maybe you can keep it f with you . 
UNKNOWN You're not you're not obliged to share it . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , we can yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's that's the advantage of intelligent controller . 
UNKNOWN Even you h you have the controller , I can I can say channel three , so it's c come to channel three , I don't have to It's advantage . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN It's it's And mayb maybe we can have the switching mode to pass from you know voice controller to manual controllers , eh . 
UNKNOWN No , but this is disadvant disadvantage . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I think it's a disadvantage . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but one other question . 
UNKNOWN How how much will it cost ? 
UNKNOWN No , more expensive maybe . 
UNKNOWN How much ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Because I suppose we need to do research to have something working . 
UNKNOWN No no we we d we we just are use um No no we just um have some cooperation with some research institute , we don't have to do some basic research on this field . 
UNKNOWN Uh if you if if you use the basic But it's it's changing how the remote control is gonna be built . 
UNKNOWN Some some efficient . 
UNKNOWN So you think it won't cost an Not a lot for us ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I think it's uh because uh this technology is uh um for limited wor or limited wor uh lexical recognition , it's very it's uh yeah . 
UNKNOWN Or ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but uh uh Mm-mm . 
UNKNOWN It's No it's uh Even for the f um because the the vocabulary the The vocabulary is very small , so that's not a problem . 
UNKNOWN Because then you need uh I mean this doesn't have uh the power to do recognition , for example . 
UNKNOWN Well y y you have also the language problem , you know when you 'Cause it it have to be universal , so . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I agree with uh Yeah , but there is one problem that uh Baba talked about is the international remote control . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN We need something that is international . 
UNKNOWN Suppose we're we want to sell it in France . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN The recognition system will be able to understand French . 
UNKNOWN If you want to go to England , it will be able to understand English , so . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , the key , the key um the key of our the key feature of our controller is that it's it has some some um adaptation mechanism . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , this could be downloaded by the web maybe , or Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah but you know . 
UNKNOWN The product The pro It's a very smart , it's a very smart controller maybe Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah . 
UNKNOWN It's It's it means when you when you sell this controller in China it's can recognise Chinese . 
UNKNOWN It's r if you sell this controller in France it can recognise French . 
UNKNOWN Mm , okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , it's Because of this product uh this technology has already been developed . 
UNKNOWN And with no increase in the pri production price of the remote control ? 
UNKNOWN But Yeah but the problem is how to s you know if this is a push button controller , you can send this con this remote control everywhere in the world , the same one . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but how will you Oh . 
UNKNOWN So Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN If you have the language , you have to develop for each country . 
UNKNOWN Oh n Yeah , yeah tha that's why we have to do language adaptation . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but for each country you have to do one , because uh the for example for Se Oh really ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Even for each f for even for different family we have to do d yeah we would we have to do adaptation to No , it's not so complex . 
UNKNOWN That's Comple A microphone maybe . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but then w Yeah , we have to take care of the twelve Euros problem . 
UNKNOWN Seems to be quite complex . 
UNKNOWN And what about voice recognition , do we have microphones ? 
UNKNOWN And where will be they ? 
UNKNOWN Do you think if we're far from television it will work ? 
UNKNOWN No no no it's not I think that's n that's not a problem because you you don't have to wear a microphone . 
UNKNOWN It it just the microphone is embedded in the controller . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but where is the controller ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Where is the controller ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It's in your family , in your home . 
UNKNOWN No , but then it's it's like this uh Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but we're here it's uh an object . 
UNKNOWN But here you say you want to use i uh s technology . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah you can you can embed it uh microphone here . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but wha what is the use of voice or gesture recognition if you have a remote control li like this , if you have an object . 
UNKNOWN If you want to use voice or gesture you need to be free , without any object . 
UNKNOWN To talk to the to the T_V_ maybe . 
UNKNOWN You just want to interact with television . 
UNKNOWN Yeah yeah just you just put the controller here , then you you use your command and you do s your gesture . 
UNKNOWN I if you say one , he switch to channel , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but you can lose it . 
UNKNOWN No no it's n y if you lose it Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So well for example if it is somewhere in the room if i maybe if it is in the table there you can always say s channel one and the t the remote control gives the order to the T_V_ to switch to channel one . 
UNKNOWN Okay you so you can build a kind of black box and put it on T_V_ and just to recognize gestures and voice . 
UNKNOWN Devic Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah but so you need a camera and you know a microphone inside your remote control . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Ah . 
UNKNOWN But you would still have the buttons . 
UNKNOWN Or is it do you think it should be only voice recognition and gesture recognition ? 
UNKNOWN Or you you still have the possibility to use buttons ? 
UNKNOWN I think it we should give the uh flexibility to the user and we think yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so you yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but Mm . 
UNKNOWN You can see they can switch form one modality to another . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I dunno . 
UNKNOWN It's a bit risky risky . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think so . 
UNKNOWN No , that's quite inter quite attractive . 
UNKNOWN And maybe it will be quite Okay . 
UNKNOWN But I think that , you know , switching from one country to to another will be a problem , so although y y Yeah but i i Yeah , we should . 
UNKNOWN Well , if you do language adaptation , there should be no problem . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I dunno . 
UNKNOWN We should have confidence in technology . 
CONFUSION Uh . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN So , what do you think ? 
UNKNOWN We'll try the controllers you'd prefer . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN What ? 
UNKNOWN Which kind of controller would you prefer to use , you as a remote control user ? 
UNKNOWN If if I mean , uh I'm sure if the user pays the same price , he's happy to have recognition . 
UNKNOWN More features , yeah . 
UNKNOWN But if if if it like doubles uh no one would would be interested . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but I think he need a control that is very reliable , so . 
UNKNOWN So I think it would be better not to do any intelligent controller and to stay with the Google controller or a fancy controller . 
UNKNOWN Maybe try to mix the Google controller and the fancy controller ? 
UNKNOWN Hmm ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Just want to have something controller which is in a kind of intelligent controller , easy to use , sophisticated and fancy . 
UNKNOWN Yeah but if if you stick to um stick to the first two parts . 
UNKNOWN You think it's possible ? 
UNKNOWN So what's the difference between our controller with other products in the market ? 
UNKNOWN There's no k features of our controller , so is there is there any necessary to design new controller without any breakthrough features ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN No , I mean Y No , but you need you need new remote controller then . 
UNKNOWN Would y would you replace your controller with a controller with similar function if you do not have some some function inside it that Yeah , you y that's a fun that's not the function of the controller , that's a function of T_V_ . 
UNKNOWN It's not really the we we can add for example some function like for browsing in internet , so or something like that . 
UNKNOWN But uh I think a user need Don't have a the the Yeah if we can send emailfrom it . 
UNKNOWN You can replace your T_V_ with a new T_V_ with internet browsing function , but Okay . 
UNKNOWN Because if you wanna browse internet or , I don't know , if you wanna type something , or No . 
UNKNOWN But it's not the only the problem only the issue of controller , it's it's also the issue of the T_V_ . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN Because the p the problem I can see with with the voice or the gesture itself wh what can happen in a family i i for example if Yeah And for all the person of the family maybe , so , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Cause for example yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but we do we do we we we cannot rely one hundred percent on these features to u to use the controller , but with the features of our controller such as you have the feature of voice recognition in your mobile but you seldom use it , your mobile , but you when you choose a new mobile , you choose the one with voice recognition . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but uh we want so Yeah , but w we we want something th that works all the time , every day , every hour , for everyone . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , you wou you would True . 
UNKNOWN That's the feature is not one hundred percent reliable , but it's a feature to distinguish our product from our from other products . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , uh Yeah , if if if if you're if you ar if you already have a product it works one hundred percent reliable , would you replace it with another one ? 
UNKNOWN You don't need to tune it . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , why not ? 
UNKNOWN I mean , for example the goo y you say we would we would to have a Google-like controller . 
UNKNOWN If it's Not too expensive too . 
UNKNOWN Because you have new Ye Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I don't see how adding speech or gesture recognition would make the remote control look more like Google . 
UNKNOWN Google is is simple , works fine , so I I guess if can have a remote control that is really basic , simple and works fine , it's already a lot . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Oh yes , but there's no big difference between the traditional controller . 
UNKNOWN Uh thi this I mean , the user is not only interested in having speech or gesture recognition or if he has something that works fine and is really fancy , looks nice and it's easy easy to use , easy to use . 
UNKNOWN The then nn no . 
UNKNOWN Tha But the there's there's n there's n not enough motivation for them to replace their old controller with a new one if there's no key feature in the new controller . 
UNKNOWN See That's the problem , yeah . 
UNKNOWN That's the same yeah . 
UNKNOWN I mean , I I know it's more interesting to develop a remote controller with speech and gesture and whatever . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But you have to think , the user is the one who gonna buy the product and so . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN I mean , that's the point . 
UNKNOWN So let's go to the Industrial Designer . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Maybe we'll be able to take a decision after that , so . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Two ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , participant two um Yeah , working design , so . 
UNKNOWN Working ? 
UNKNOWN So I think Can you go to the next one ? 
UNKNOWN I can Okay . 
UNKNOWN I uh it's not this one . 
UNKNOWN It's uh oth the oth so I It's the working design . 
UNKNOWN Sorry . 
UNKNOWN Component design . 
UNKNOWN It's okay Uh I think there's something wrong with your Maybe you you record it somewhere else . 
UNKNOWN So this yeah so this is the described use What ? 
UNKNOWN Are you inst I don't think so . 
UNKNOWN It did didn't r receive it . 
UNKNOWN Didn't receive it . 
UNKNOWN Participant one . 
UNKNOWN Participant one . 
UNKNOWN Interface concept . 
NEGATION No . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Mm mm . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN Maybe I record recorded directly on the Computer . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Uh . 
CONFUSION Dunno . 
UNKNOWN Nope . 
UNKNOWN Okay , okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN It seems that we have a problem with the Yeah , so No , I think it will be more interesting to start with uh Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I dunno if you remember what you had to say or I think it's more interesting what he says , okay . 
UNKNOWN I can say it to you without . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , maybe we can first come to uh to Frahan . 
UNKNOWN With Frahan , then you can prepare your slides, then present it later . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , exac Okay . 
UNKNOWN You will had s some more information in I think it will be interesting after your presentationto have um Baba's presentation. 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , true . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN In fact , I don't know , I s because i in my presentationI don't have here with so It was in fact the design use to show you the design of what is inside a what is inside and what are the different component of the r of the remote control . 
UNKNOWN So . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Okay , never mind . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So it will be interesting so I could show you some some picture of what is inside and so . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So I in fact the the f something I want to discuss is which kind of material are we going to use , so will it will be wooden wooden di wooden remote control or a a plastic remote control like this one . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So and in which which which kind will be the the different bu button , so it can be some , you know , classic pushbutton like this one , or you have also some button like L_C_D_ where you know , the button the buttons are unlighted during the night , or , you know , you can see them in the darkness . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN And the other thing I want to discuss also is which kind of alimentation , electric alimentation do you want to have , so will it be for example uh d uh solar energy alimentation or will it be a battery like the classical battery so . 
UNKNOWN Uh-huh . 
UNKNOWN And I think that for example for the alimentation it would be good to have uh both of them , so so for example in some country where you are in the the countryside and you are far from , you know , the cities uh for example in some place in in S Senegal , so if you have electric if you have solar alimentation , you just , when you want to have recharger or remote control power you just put it on the sun and after one hour you can come and so it can be interesting for people to have this kind of remote con It can be something interesting to make people buy it , for example . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I think it's an added value to the remote control and maybe it can attract all the ecological k yeah consumers and but about the the price of adding this solar battery , would it be something really that will increase the price of production more , no ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah mm . 
UNKNOWN Ecologists , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Alrigh In fact , having them both will if we want to have battery , regular battery and and the solar energy battery it could be it'll it will add a little bit of the price , but it will be an added value also that will be compensated , so hmm . 
UNKNOWN So . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN And what tha what about the uh materials ? 
UNKNOWN And the materials , it depends for example you if you have a wooden material it can be more the plastic material is more common it's very resistant but , you know , something wooden will be like , I don't know high cl so a special high class , or you know , you can have some Yeah , even if it is not completely wood , but just a part of the , you know , will be wooden , in wood and it can be interesting . 
UNKNOWN Impersonal , mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Special for Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , and i if you we want to put fashion in electronics maybe we can try to do something with wood . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Mm okay , seems to be interesting , mm . 
UNKNOWN And so the last point is y also would do you want to have some very cheap integrated cir circuits , chips , or do you have low level or or very very expensive , it depends , but I think that low level will be , you know , it is an interim module . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , we want something easy to use and so I think maybe something very low level wou would be enough . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah . 
UNKNOWN And you think that we will be Okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I think it will fit on the price we want , twel twelve Euros , so . 
UNKNOWN So wood . 
UNKNOWN And what about the buttons ? 
UNKNOWN I think the buttons I pr I prefer , you know , the L_C_D_ you know lighted buttons because , you know , it's I don't know um yeah , in the dark , it's fashion and it's related to how beautiful it is or uh if you want to watch T_V_ in the darkness or if you want to lo find your find your your remote control that is lost , you know in the darkness it's very easy so , right . 
UNKNOWN No it's fashion , yeah . 
UNKNOWN What about the touch scr touch screen ? 
UNKNOWN For example . 
UNKNOWN It's it's expensive I I guess . 
UNKNOWN I think a touch screen will be t as expensive as the L_C_D_ buttons so . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN But And it is a kind of other design , I mean . 
UNKNOWN It can also be interesting to have this kind of Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So you got email? 
UNKNOWN I dunno . 
UNKNOWN I think we have only uh five minutes left . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Participant four ? 
UNKNOWN Functional requirements ? 
UNKNOWN Uh no , trend watching . 
UNKNOWN The other one . 
UNKNOWN This one ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh , I think so , just Yeah , so just to meet the user requirements I would just do a s short anal analysis of the remote control market and to kind of um have a better overview of what's the fashion in general I've checked more than only the remote control market , so next . 
UNKNOWN So again , it's pretty much similar to what I've said in the previous meeting . 
UNKNOWN Um user really really want a fancy look and feel . 
UNKNOWN They're not so so interested in uh functional look and feel , okay . 
UNKNOWN Like the one you've shown , David , with all the buttons and I mean i i it sounds good technically but it's it's not what they want and uh So , second point is they still want it it to be technologically innovative , so maybe it's sort of related to what you've said with the speech recognition and so on . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN At the same time , it's important that it's easy to use . 
UNKNOWN So that were the three first points from the remote control uh analysis . 
UNKNOWN Now i if we look at fashion in general um Okay . 
UNKNOWN Wha what we really see this year is that uh everything from clothes to shoes and furniture is is inspired by fruits and vegetables , okay , so I think we really have to take this into account for the design of the the thing . 
UNKNOWN Ah yes . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay , yeah . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause it's it's really what people want . 
UNKNOWN Even if it's in general fashion , we want it to be in the remote control . 
UNKNOWN And then uh if if we take the ordering or the ranking of all the points , fancy look and feel has , on a score of seven would have six as importance . 
UNKNOWN Uh the remote control has to be technologically innovative , it's three . 
UNKNOWN Then easy to use uh it's not so important actually with respect to other y other ones . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So we see fancy look an look and feel is the most important one , and then if we combine this with the fashion uh from Milan and Paris we go to the fruits and vede vegetables . 
UNKNOWN And fruit and vegetables yeah . 
UNKNOWN And the other point I haven't mention is people wan want to have a spongy touch , okay so this is this maybe doesn't really fit with the wooden design . 
UNKNOWN Spongy 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN Okay , yeah , yeah . 
UNKNOWN I dunno . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but the problem is which kind of material do you need to to be spongy ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah thi this is this would be like um plastic-like , but rubber , mayb maybe , you know , rubber-like uh device , so um Okay , tha tha that was the main point , I think , from the trend in fashion . 
UNKNOWN Pla S Very stuff Okay , rubber rubber desi okay , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So we have to take decisions about the component concepts , about the energy . 
UNKNOWN So , as you say you want something technologically innovative , maybe using solar energy and with battery would be something interesting , maybe will attract pro-ecology consumers . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Solar . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , so when I think it's Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It will be a Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh cheap imprint so you s you propose low level chips would be uh enough to have something working well . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I think Yeah , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Case . 
UNKNOWN Later ? 
UNKNOWN So you think case . 
UNKNOWN Something spongy . 
UNKNOWN Someth no wood . 
UNKNOWN No wood but Plastic ? 
UNKNOWN Maybe not no wood , but I mean ma maybe not the part you touching you know . 
UNKNOWN Would some I think we can have wood for example in the bottom and , you know . 
UNKNOWN Pla Uh yes . 
UNKNOWN Maybe you It's it's natural . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , maybe the base . 
UNKNOWN It depends on the design we want , so . 
UNKNOWN But still y Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , it's natural and i And it can be correlated to energy , solar energy , so for the marketing aspect , you know , saying that it's ecol Mm , yeah , it's not right , so . 
UNKNOWN Th The feeling is natural , so maybe we can stay with wood . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I mean it's not exactly right for the spongy point of view . 
UNKNOWN But it's still fashion . 
UNKNOWN But we could maybe have both like part of wood and some rubber for the buttons , or I dunno . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , something that you can into it . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh and what about the user interface concept ? 
UNKNOWN Google and and fancy , f how about the the voice ? 
UNKNOWN Google and fancy ? 
UNKNOWN Because I think that with the voice and gesture recognition there are still some disadvantages with this . 
UNKNOWN And Uh maybe we can do some marketing studies asking people if they're interested and how It It is an an interesting concept to see to have uh voice control . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN The smart controller . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But and the problem is I I'm we can infer i if you have v voice control why not to put it directly on the the T_V_ , so speak directly to the T_V_ and you don't need a remote control actually , so . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but you need a receiver to recognize the gestures and the voice . 
UNKNOWN But it will be embedded on the T_V_ and not on the remote control , so . 
UNKNOWN That's true . 
UNKNOWN Yeah d I dunno . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So maybe we'll just focus on the Google controller plus the fancy controller , maybe try to mix them these two concepts together , just in one and do a remote control with solar energy and batteries and with lev low level chips and wood . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It's good . 
UNKNOWN And L_C_D_ buttons . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , L_C_D_ . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I think for these supplements the solar energy would be something quite interesting and not maybe too difficult to add . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah , yeah . 
UNKNOWN And pf what can we think a supplement to I think the supplement can be the voice . 
UNKNOWN What interface ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , for the interface something added value . 
UNKNOWN It is just , you know , it is not the most important , but it can be a part of Yeah , yeah . 
UNKNOWN With a module ? 
UNKNOWN You mean the remote control with a mur module if you want you can just use commands , words and use them when you don't want to use your fingers . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN To push button , yeah , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Even it is for s just some kids , you know , switching channels one two three four . 
UNKNOWN Turning the T_V_ o on o or off . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , turning yeah , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Not very complex commands , but easy commands , so . 
UNKNOWN So , adding some vocal commands . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Simple ones ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , simple ones for expensive buttons Yeah , to make some new Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So the next meeting will start in thirty meeti minutes so we'll you will all have to work in in your direction . 
UNKNOWN So you will have to work on the look and feel design , to have the easy to use , powerful and fancy remote control with some added value such as the uh simple vocal commands recognition . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh you will have to work more , Baba , on the um spongy way to to add spongy um touch to the buttons and try to find maybe a nice shape for the wooden remote control . 
UNKNOWN And I sup I think we'll have to evaluate th the product too . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , no not forgetting about the fruits and vegetables trends . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay , fruits . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN If possible . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN And remember as as I said last meeting , we really have to build a fashion remote control and uh the colour of the um the society will be really it will be seen in the remote control . 
UNKNOWN Need it to be , okay . 
UNKNOWN So you will have Baba and David Jordan you will have to work together on the prototype and you will have next time to show us um modelling a cl a clay remote control , so you will have to model model something . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Yep Okay . 
UNKNOWN And I think that some specific instructions will be sent to you by your personal coach . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So , no more questions , we can close the session . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Sounds good , mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay , cool . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So , ready ? 
UNKNOWN No not really . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN Just Crap . 
UNKNOWN Sorry , I I um I'm afraid Uh thi this remote control will stay a prototype . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN It's perfect . 
UNKNOWN Your judgement it's is biased . 
UNKNOWN 'Kay , so whe where is the remote control ? 
UNKNOWN So , we are So let's go for our detailed design meeting . 
UNKNOWN Where ? 
UNKNOWN It's here . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN So I will still play the role of the secretary , and we'll have um first the project presentationby our User Interface Designer , David Jordan , and our Industrial Designer , Baba . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN So we'll have to evaluate the uh your proposed remote control , and um have an idea of the price that uh this thing will cost . 
UNKNOWN And in case if we're we all agree on the fabrica of um building of this remote control , we'll evaluate the um production . 
UNKNOWN So maybe I will let the our two designers talk about so their You have s oh , sorry . 
UNKNOWN I have slides. 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Oops . 
UNKNOWN Ah , that is three . 
UNKNOWN Effectively one slideand maybe we can discuss everything . 
UNKNOWN Product prod Yep . 
UNKNOWN What slides? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So , this is our product or prototype . 
UNKNOWN This is made by clay . 
UNKNOWN Looks strange . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh the basic colour is uh yellow and red . 
UNKNOWN Yellow is uh our company colour , uh red it's uh is more attractive . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So we used two basic colour , yellow and red . 
UNKNOWN And the shape , there's two basic shape . 
UNKNOWN The first is a circle and the second is a triangle s piece . 
UNKNOWN It's we call it a mushroom design . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN It's looks like some mushroom , so we call it mushroom design . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh Yeah , yeah I'm sure . 
UNKNOWN So this is a introduction of our product . 
UNKNOWN Next a mo Okay , yeah , so next slide. 
UNKNOWN Genetically modified mushroom I will say , but keep on speaking . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So there are several key features of our pr prototype . 
UNKNOWN The first is that it is fuzzy . 
UNKNOWN I'm sure this would be the unique design the market . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN Maybe , I hope so . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , so it's a fuzzy design , and a unique design . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's true . 
UNKNOWN Um , and uh the second key feature is that uh s circle channel um selection . 
UNKNOWN In the traditional key uh traditional controller use button to to select the channel but now we have a s circle , so we can turn this ball to t to select channel . 
UNKNOWN So it's quite convenient for user to use it . 
UNKNOWN Chan Yeah , okay , but don't touch don't destroy your prototype . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , s okay . 
UNKNOWN Uh the third feature is a stable triangle base . 
UNKNOWN Uh this sta uh this triangle base is very stable , so uh so it's it's um it's unlikely you cannot found it . 
UNKNOWN So it's v Um , you can put it in the table so you can turn the the ball to cha to select the channel and there's some cute button . 
UNKNOWN You c can can you can see the the shape of the buttons n is a mushroom , so Yeah , everything's mushroom . 
UNKNOWN Everything's mushroom . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So we can call our remote control the mushroom . 
UNKNOWN Mush Mushroom design , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah but it's not like really mushroom because you have uh you know uh like lemon shape , you know , centre is yellow and t d To integrate , you know yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , th that's why if you put it in the table , be careful , somebody will eat it . 
UNKNOWN I don't think I hope nobody will eat it . 
UNKNOWN You know , to integrate the fruit aspect , you know the the in Really ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN Yeah , because mushroom was not in the trends . 
UNKNOWN I mean there was fruits yeah . 
UNKNOWN Fruits and vegetables . 
UNKNOWN But Fruit and vegetable , so mushroom was a kind of you know uh Mushroom ? 
UNKNOWN Vegetables . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Mushroom is a vegetable . 
UNKNOWN I don't think it is . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It's vegetable . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Oh , uh I'm not sure . 
UNKNOWN So th it's something eatable . 
UNKNOWN We can it's a veg a kind of vegetable , but you know we we integrated them with different colour . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But anyway this is not a mushroom anyway , so it's fine . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I I think we take into account what you said about fruit and vegetable you know . 
UNKNOWN This , you know , very enlighted colours , you know . 
UNKNOWN No , I mean , yeah yeah . 
UNKNOWN Inspira inspiration is True . 
UNKNOWN And inspired colour and and very sophisticated material , so . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And so So what we w what I can add is that , you know he talk about what is outside , so what is inside is what we dis what we talked before about , you know , the chip , it is a low level chip , and You know , we don't need to k . 
UNKNOWN Next slide. 
UNKNOWN Uh , no this our only two slides. 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So we cut it to see . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN You know wi the low level chips inside and you know the L_C_D_ button and the i The battery it is under . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So where's the battery battery ? 
UNKNOWN It is in th in in the base , yeah . 
UNKNOWN In the base . 
UNKNOWN Base . 
UNKNOWN In the basement . 
UNKNOWN Here ? 
UNKNOWN In the basement . 
UNKNOWN And where is the solar solar cell ? 
UNKNOWN But we say uh we sa we said solar . 
UNKNOWN Where is the solar cell ? 
UNKNOWN In fact this this this this is a kind of you know revolutionary solar receptor that we can put outside and I don't think so , but it it's might be okay , so . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN Do you think it won't be It won't cris increase the price ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Okay , we'll see after . 
UNKNOWN We will have first to so , mister money , what's your opinion according to this remote control ? 
UNKNOWN I it might be okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I mean , we gonna try to measure how good it is instead of just talking about uh we had three keys key points to uh for this remote control design , and first one was uh fancy look and feel . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So w we'll try to judge this feature uh with a one to seven scale , one being uh no , I think . 
UNKNOWN Uh just let me check . 
UNKNOWN So , four point three point five , it means it's acceptable . 
UNKNOWN One one being true , and seven being false . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Oops . 
UNKNOWN Ouch . 
UNKNOWN So Do we have a fancy look and feel , according to you ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , I think so . 
UNKNOWN I think you have nice colours . 
UNKNOWN I don't The sha the bowl shape people like . 
UNKNOWN But is it Uh I'll agree it's unique , but is it really Yeah I mean , fancy was was defined by s fruit and vegetable look . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , the shape is unique , and the colour So it depend on how d do you define fancy . 
UNKNOWN Is it really fancy ? 
UNKNOWN But it's you have the lemon aspect of this th this this thing . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Maybe if you change if you take the buttons out , and maybe do things like that It would be bet more like a lemon ? 
UNKNOWN Do Don't do that , please . 
UNKNOWN I dunno where the lemon is , but I mean it's not obvious . 
UNKNOWN I it's it's i this shape is a lemon like , so Yeah . 
UNKNOWN If I dunno , maybe improving the texture of like having it less smooth or Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Because i Less button . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh so , my mush . 
UNKNOWN Looks like more fruit . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but you don't have any button now . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Maybe a pineapple ? 
UNKNOWN I dunno . 
UNKNOWN And you know , you have the finger here , with the buttons ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN That's uh yeah , is that that's a good idea . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , it's getting Okay . 
UNKNOWN So that's great . 
UNKNOWN It looks more like a pineapple . 
UNKNOWN That's great . 
UNKNOWN Sorry . 
UNKNOWN What's the use for that ? 
UNKNOWN Uh , for turn turn the ball . 
UNKNOWN I have no idea , so . 
UNKNOWN If you want to turn the ball , it's very it's very convenient for you to to to turn the ball to change the channel . 
UNKNOWN I have no idea what If it is fancy or not . 
UNKNOWN And where is the voice recognition ? 
CONFUSION Uh . 
UNKNOWN Ah , it's embedded , your microphone . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's Wait th that's the second point . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Th this th th there's two two functions . 
UNKNOWN This is microphone array Okay . 
UNKNOWN First one is we have to judge the fancy look and feel . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Is it better like that ? 
UNKNOWN I mean No , the colour is okay , that's fine . 
UNKNOWN So we can we can say t The colour , is the colour acceptable ? 
UNKNOWN Looks okay , let's say it's a pineapple now . 
UNKNOWN So the shape now . 
UNKNOWN I mean it's but I would say there is more too much red . 
UNKNOWN It looks like a now you took it . 
UNKNOWN It's too much red ? 
UNKNOWN Um if Right . 
UNKNOWN In the basement ? 
UNKNOWN It looks like a pineapple with cherry on top . 
UNKNOWN So , from one to seven ? 
UNKNOWN Mm uh Seven is the ma the maximum ? 
UNKNOWN I will give I will I'll gi I'll give two or three . 
UNKNOWN No , seven is false and one is true . 
UNKNOWN Three , it's okay . 
UNKNOWN Three , I will say three . 
UNKNOWN Three , three . 
UNKNOWN Three ? 
UNKNOWN Three is fine for me . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN Three . 
UNKNOWN Isn't it bitter like that ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah yeah yeah . 
UNKNOWN Then uh let me The other criterion is is it technologically uh technologically in innovative . 
UNKNOWN What other Is it easy to use ? 
UNKNOWN Feasible ? 
UNKNOWN Ye uh Embedded . 
UNKNOWN You said previously that you there's um microphone inside an Oh . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , this is microphone array , in fact . 
UNKNOWN It's a micro array , okay . 
UNKNOWN There four microphone . 
UNKNOWN Okay , and you have the there's the technology inside that recognise simple vocal comments ? 
UNKNOWN So they they they they there's a microphone array . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah . 
UNKNOWN So you can capture voice yeah , you c Yeah , so you can capture s voice from different directions . 
UNKNOWN And you can turn it so maybe it's techno technologically innov innovative ? 
UNKNOWN Oh yeah , yeah . 
UNKNOWN And I think you you've never seen a rou a round remote control , so it is I W Yeah , but I see , you have microphone array embedded . 
UNKNOWN Yeah bu but when you say technologically it's more uh I dunno , in the core , or single . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN We have tactile buttons . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN You have That's good . 
UNKNOWN No , that's good . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And you have , you know this ki this solar receptor that , you know Yes . 
UNKNOWN Oh , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , th that's another really good point . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Maybe okay . 
UNKNOWN I think technically it's acceptable , so Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Maybe two ? 
UNKNOWN So using the same scale , two ? 
UNKNOWN Two ? 
UNKNOWN Two , yeah , two . 
UNKNOWN I would say two . 
UNKNOWN It's it's fine , so . 
UNKNOWN You agree ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I agree . 
UNKNOWN It's better like that , isn't it ? 
UNKNOWN Now maybe the most critical one . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Most Eh , for th the vocal command yes , it's might be easy . 
UNKNOWN L last one w I would like to judge is is it easy to use ? 
UNKNOWN But it's just speaking . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , it's very easy . 
UNKNOWN You just need the command . 
UNKNOWN Yeah but this this turning can you can you just re explain me the Please . 
UNKNOWN You can use this in this way . 
UNKNOWN As a principle . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Th this is the base . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So you can turn to change the channel . 
UNKNOWN Yeah but how how intuitive is it to turn things to change channels ? 
UNKNOWN You just tu turn d d Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think maybe if you he If you hear some click Yeah , it would Oh yeah , that's difficult . 
UNKNOWN Like if you want to go from Yeah but imagine you y Yeah I'm I'm no I'm not definitely convinced it's it's the best way to if you wanna jump from , I dunno , one to twenty ? 
UNKNOWN Oh , ok I understand . 
UNKNOWN You take take the remote , so and you can turn like that to change the channel ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think it's quite easy to so s zapping , but maybe it will be too fast . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN How can you go directly to twenty , for example ? 
UNKNOWN That's dif that's difficult . 
UNKNOWN No , no , no . 
UNKNOWN I if y uh if it depend on the the angle you turn the I if if this is a channel one . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah but y how you need to know I I think something that Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I agree . 
UNKNOWN I agree . 
UNKNOWN But I mean if you're fro from two ? 
UNKNOWN So it c it could be channel two , channel three , channel four , channel five . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , you have a , like that , and so on . 
UNKNOWN So change . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And you you can I think you can if you have a scale , so Yeah , it's a bit difficult . 
UNKNOWN Yeah ju just imagine you have fifty fifty channels uh We're not talking Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Oh yeah . 
UNKNOWN Y uh fifth channel divided by the num by the by three hundred thirteen degree . 
UNKNOWN So you got how many degree you you it No no , you don't have to y no it's uh when you when you stop t uh when you stop , the the turn , then the angle you stop is the angle you is the channel you It's it's very easy , because you kn you know how many channel are there in the Yeah , yeah , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah but y but you have to go through all the channels if you want to go Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN How d how do you know this angle is th is the correct one ? 
UNKNOWN So you you count one degree , two degrees , no . 
UNKNOWN You can do it . 
UNKNOWN I don't think so . 
UNKNOWN I think so I think so you can do it . 
UNKNOWN I think so , you can just change . 
UNKNOWN I think b but the the vocal command is easy too . 
UNKNOWN You can say fifty and fifty it's okay , so Uh , yeah , and y that's yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah voc vocal command is okay . 
UNKNOWN But w we've said previously that maybe it's not going to be th l the main And this would be more for browsing , ah . 
UNKNOWN There's uh also a number , you know . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but when you're zapping you're changing from one channel to the other , so you're passing through all the channels . 
UNKNOWN So , when you say I want to go to the channel number twenty that's you've decided to go to channel twenty , so you can say channel twenty , or channel four , because you really want to go on this channel . 
UNKNOWN But if you really want to to do zapping you you don't really know what you want to do , you can turn it . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Just go through all the channels and maybe stop if there is something interesting ? 
UNKNOWN To see uh yeah uh Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Seems to be good . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Good choice , mister David Jordan . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I mean you're famous . 
UNKNOWN And but I'd It is a turn off t turn off button , maybe . 
UNKNOWN And also you can , if you i You ca you can turn this . 
UNKNOWN You . 
UNKNOWN yeah , what's what's this cherry ? 
UNKNOWN Or you ca you can you can also turn this . 
UNKNOWN For this you can tune it's for tune . 
UNKNOWN You you if you want to skip from channel one to channel two , you you skip this . 
UNKNOWN If you want to from uh skip from channel one to channel ten you tune this . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN It's like fine , from coarse to fine . 
UNKNOWN This is coarse , this is fine . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah yeah . 
UNKNOWN That's that's very technologic , so . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So it's coarse to fine design . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay the uh th this looks better . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah is is this is , from one channel to maybe to ten channel . 
UNKNOWN S But I di I didn't see where the t f the turn off t turn on turn off button so much activates maybe one of the Uh it's k on off , yeah . 
UNKNOWN This is from one channel to Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , th you have the vocal commands . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN On off . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but it has to be on to recognise fas Ah , that's not the ecological part , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Most of the time you have the yeah it's a sleeping remote control . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , sleeping . 
UNKNOWN That's true . 
UNKNOWN W that why we have the solar ti yeah . 
UNKNOWN Solar . 
UNKNOWN To compensate . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So three . 
UNKNOWN So , which number ? 
UNKNOWN Easy to use , it's very relative but three it's fine , I think , it's reasonable three . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Do you agree ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , agree , agree . 
UNKNOWN Three ? 
UNKNOWN So reasonably , is four , is one ? 
UNKNOWN Three f three for me , it's o it's okay . 
UNKNOWN So , three . 
UNKNOWN Four or three . 
UNKNOWN Maybe you can vote to see how many everybody gives and no and just take the mean . 
UNKNOWN And what's your opinion ? 
UNKNOWN Uh we wouldn't say , I mean , those are sort of agreed but this one would be more five to me . 
UNKNOWN Will you give four ? 
UNKNOWN Five ? 
UNKNOWN I'd like I mean this is the just a prototype . 
UNKNOWN I'm not really convinced it's so easy to use , but I don't know . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , so maybe if Yeah but y you know You just push two button , zero and and one . 
UNKNOWN Uh w w what do y what uh you compare with traditional uh um tr traditional controller ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think it's easier than traditional controller . 
UNKNOWN If you use traditional controller you have to put a button , but now you don't have to put button , you have you just turn the turn the ball . 
UNKNOWN There's two kind of balls , the smaller the the the so you can c you can c you can control the scale . 
UNKNOWN So you have yeah . 
UNKNOWN But in the traditional controller , how do how can you control the scale ? 
UNKNOWN Uh by pushing zero after after the first one . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah , yeah , y you you can do it , but you can also do it in the b if you you do not wa if you do not want to browsing all the channel you can just p there's also a button here . 
UNKNOWN And that's Are there some buttons ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , this function is just for your browsing , from one channel to th the next one , the next s sn s , the th the third one . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN It's not what you said previously . 
UNKNOWN Previously you said that turning this was the fine Fine to coarse . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , if you're changing your mind . 
UNKNOWN Fine to coarse . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah . 
UNKNOWN And from ten to ten channels here . 
UNKNOWN Y one to ten , ten to twelve , uh ten to t uh twenty . 
UNKNOWN Ten to twenty and this one , t one two three four five six , like this . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Uh there's different scale , so you can you can choose how much do you want to sc Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN But this this has to stay on the table , right ? 
UNKNOWN This has to stay on the table . 
UNKNOWN I i this is just a base . 
UNKNOWN In fact on a flat place You can Oh ye yes , that's right . 
UNKNOWN You can just Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah but then uh when you turn turn it Just It's Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Oh Yeah , no no , no . 
UNKNOWN You can't put it out . 
UNKNOWN It's just your turning from the base . 
UNKNOWN You need to have everything in hand . 
UNKNOWN If you want to turn , you can't use it and turn . 
UNKNOWN It's impossible . 
UNKNOWN You need to put it on and turn . 
UNKNOWN You know tha that's the weak point , because with a traditional one you just have one hand . 
UNKNOWN Oh my God . 
UNKNOWN You use your y So th this is a d next generation controller . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but nobody would be able to take it in the pocket and bring it in the kitchen and say I've lost the remote control . 
UNKNOWN Nobody would take it . 
CONFIRMATION Sure . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , you would never you would never lose this one , yeah . 
UNKNOWN So nobody w will lost lose it . 
UNKNOWN yeah maybe , maybe may it's the next prototype , maybe we cou Four . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay okay , okay . 
UNKNOWN S maybe we can change from th Four ? 
UNKNOWN Maybe four , it's okay . 
UNKNOWN Four . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN I'll put four . 
UNKNOWN Easy to use , four . 
UNKNOWN Gonna say four . 
UNKNOWN Four . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , four it's more reasonable . 
UNKNOWN Uh it's even easier to maybe . 
UNKNOWN You can you can erase with this er yeah . 
UNKNOWN Ok Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , four it's more reasonable , so . 
UNKNOWN So it's nine , nine over three . 
UNKNOWN So , average ? 
UNKNOWN Three ? 
UNKNOWN Three ? 
UNKNOWN Trois . 
UNKNOWN Oh yeah , it's . 
UNKNOWN Three . 
UNKNOWN Trois . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so Yeah , especially on the easy to use target . 
UNKNOWN It need maybe some wo further work , but it's Yeah , uh s yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Might it might be fine . 
UNKNOWN So , th the project is accepted ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , b I think Yeah , yeah . 
UNKNOWN But I d m I think that it will be good to do some more work to transform this into a pineapple . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN If you re we really want to have a fruitful remote control . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So uh mm mm . 
UNKNOWN That's the finance . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Okay and we we had a project prototype presentationwith the evaluation . 
UNKNOWN So as we all agree to accept , under certain conditions , the prototype , we'll have look to the final sh financial view . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So we need to calculate the production cost . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN As I said in the first meeting we need to have so a remote control that would cost not more than twelve and point fifty Euros . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN And if not if it's not the case y you would have to redesign it . 
UNKNOWN Oh yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So , just have a look at the okay here is the Excel sheet, so so it has the energy source . 
UNKNOWN We have hand dynamo . 
UNKNOWN No , we don't use that . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN We have battery , right ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , we have battery . 
UNKNOWN Kinetic , we don't have it , I suppose , but we have solar cells . 
UNKNOWN No , um solar cells , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um , how many do y do you need , solar cells ? 
UNKNOWN Do you think one would be enough , or such as as number of branches ? 
UNKNOWN Uh I think in each ball you have three three uh yeah , three , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Three ? 
UNKNOWN Three three solar cells . 
UNKNOWN So , electronic . 
UNKNOWN Single simple chip on print? 
UNKNOWN Just one would be necessary ? 
UNKNOWN S s simple , simple , yeah . 
UNKNOWN One ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Zero for the others . 
UNKNOWN And sample sensor , sample speaker . 
UNKNOWN One ? 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN One maybe , yeah . 
UNKNOWN As we have voice recognition , I think . 
UNKNOWN Yeah yeah yeah . 
UNKNOWN So the case . 
UNKNOWN Is it Is sh it Wooden . 
UNKNOWN So we are all already nineteen . 
UNKNOWN Okay , just keep on going , just to have an idea . 
UNKNOWN The solar cell is too expensive . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Is Yes a wooden pl I and that's There's no wood , so plastic just only , I think . 
UNKNOWN Well uh yeah , but what what about case ? 
UNKNOWN Uncurved , flat , single curved , double curved . 
UNKNOWN I think it's more like double curved . 
UNKNOWN That's gonna be double curved , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Double curve , yeah , double curve . 
UNKNOWN One ? 
UNKNOWN One , you have . 
UNKNOWN Uh wood ? 
UNKNOWN But it's yeah , a a rubber uh Yeah , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Rather four buttons . 
UNKNOWN Oh no , interface . 
UNKNOWN Uh do we need special colour ? 
UNKNOWN Y maybe , two ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah that's special colours , sure . 
UNKNOWN We have two special colours . 
UNKNOWN Y y yeah , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Push button . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , we have four . 
UNKNOWN Five ? 
UNKNOWN Five . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Scroll wheel . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN We don no . 
UNKNOWN It it's more like integrated scor . 
UNKNOWN I think that this will be like a scroll wheel , actually . 
UNKNOWN No no . 
UNKNOWN Yeah tha that's wheel . 
UNKNOWN Y you tu you turn you turn it , so Yeah , true . 
UNKNOWN No no no , it Okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , maybe two scroll wheel , as we have the coarse coarse to fine scroll wheel . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay , yeah , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Scr L_C_ display , maybe . 
UNKNOWN So , no button supplements ? 
UNKNOWN I think the price is okay . 
NEGATION No . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um , no . 
UNKNOWN Okay we I think we have problem . 
UNKNOWN Interface . 
UNKNOWN I think we s if we keep on adding things so we have to Maybe if w t if suppose if we change and we g put just one ? 
UNKNOWN It's okay . 
UNKNOWN fine . 
UNKNOWN Yeah w one of the m key point is solar cells . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Has it changed . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , it was stage one , so . 
UNKNOWN No y i it did change , but just imagine we have Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN We have change the electronics to from from the the the sample sensor to regular chip . 
UNKNOWN So I think you can transform the wood into plastic , maybe . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN We have to delete the the sample sensor , I think . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but we have you the the voice recognition , no ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah but this one one of the feature we were not really Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah it's the one it's m maybe we ha we have two versions , the first version , the basic version . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Advanced version we have speak . 
UNKNOWN Because uh it seems that this can be yeah , wood into plastic and it it should be fine . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , if Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Or it would be better . 
UNKNOWN Plastic is free . 
UNKNOWN So , do we need special colour ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's one of the requirement . 
UNKNOWN Because we have red . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , red and yellow . 
CONFUSION Wait .
UNKNOWN Red and yellow . 
UNKNOWN We could turn we could turn everything in either yellow or black . 
UNKNOWN Fancy . 
UNKNOWN We we can we can we c yellow . 
UNKNOWN Black then is a regular colour , so . 
UNKNOWN I think so we need if we try to have a kind of pineapple bee . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , one . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So push button then it's it's the next expensive one . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN An but we have integrated scroll wheel with push dut button . 
UNKNOWN And I think this is one . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , thi this might be . 
UNKNOWN Integrated scroll wheel push button . 
UNKNOWN So we'll we have only one ? 
UNKNOWN And push button . 
UNKNOWN Close to . 
UNKNOWN So if we have all integrated i in the scroll wheel and push button , it's uh Something flat . 
UNKNOWN One . 
UNKNOWN I can remove maybe f you have five with push buttons , so we can just , I dunno , try to modify some of them to have yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so what's the bottleneck ? 
UNKNOWN How about we change the sale ? 
UNKNOWN Double curved . 
UNKNOWN Double curve . 
UNKNOWN We can transform the double curve into single c yeah . 
UNKNOWN F some Single curve . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but flat Case , what's the ca And then one Euro left . 
UNKNOWN S uncurved . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , maybe not . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Single curve should be fine , so . 
UNKNOWN Oh , what It's it's a bad idea , so . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Ah we have one Okay . 
UNKNOWN Nearly . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Maybe don't bat no battery , only solar cells . 
UNKNOWN Um So we have one button , one wheel . 
UNKNOWN I think there's a problem with the push push button . 
UNKNOWN We only need maybe just one . 
UNKNOWN Two ? 
UNKNOWN One . 
UNKNOWN Just one . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION That's fine . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION That's fine . 
UNKNOWN Agree . 
UNKNOWN So yeah , you will have So one button , and s scroll wheel with push button on it . 
UNKNOWN One s one scroll wheel , so And the vocal chord , it's fine . 
UNKNOWN It I th it's fine . 
UNKNOWN So So , yeah . 
UNKNOWN It's good they're not charging anything for that . 
UNKNOWN It think we we've done good job , as the cost is twelve fifty e Yeah , but it's under or equal . 
UNKNOWN Cou could we have look Could we have look at the p the the prod the p the cost ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah y actually it's wrong . 
UNKNOWN We're not under twelve Euros and a half . 
UNKNOWN It's not written . 
UNKNOWN It's fine . 
UNKNOWN Sometimes it's under or equal . 
UNKNOWN It's under or equal . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN It's fine , so It's fine , twelve fifty uh The solar cells , r is i is it ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So let's say Wha what yeah . 
UNKNOWN Twelve fifty . 
UNKNOWN Which part is the most expensive part ? 
UNKNOWN Solar cells . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I think . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I think it's not t t Cheaper . 
UNKNOWN I think , yeah . 
UNKNOWN But it would i be interesting for our marketing team , to make a lot of advertisement concerning these solar cells to be Yeah but it will be technologically innova innovative , so . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , to be able to si to sell it . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN That's nice argument , but if it's it's still four our of twelve . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , with mi It's it is really really uh really very very expensive , though . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Maybe if uh okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah but we just have one button . 
UNKNOWN So it's easy to use and powerful , as the remote control a has only one button . 
UNKNOWN Easy . 
UNKNOWN I don't know about powerful . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It's easy to use . 
UNKNOWN Easy , powerful . 
UNKNOWN It's very easy to use . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN So I don't think we need to redesign the p the product . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN Uh that's what we've just done . 
UNKNOWN We've done it with it is under the if it was low , high or so . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um okay . 
UNKNOWN So Now So So did you enjoy your clay modelling ? 
UNKNOWN So So what are we going to do with this project evaluation ? 
UNKNOWN Well I think we have just have to discuss if I dunno . 
UNKNOWN Okay , okay , it's fine . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN Of course . 
UNKNOWN This is my job . 
UNKNOWN Yeah ? 
UNKNOWN Was it a nice way to create your remote control ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , it's uh it's good , to to create a control instead of a computer . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I think I find it really funny and amazing and interesting to go through all the process to from the beginning to the end . 
UNKNOWN And designing , looking at the chips , the solar cells and uh and it was very informative for . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And for the marketing guy ? 
UNKNOWN Uh tha that was good but we should have more brainstorming like meetings , maybe . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause we just presenting one is presenting his stuff next one his stuff and then we try to combine afterwards , so it um . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Okay , okay . 
UNKNOWN And new ideas about new products , maybe , wi which would be fashion and uh and yellow . 
UNKNOWN Yellow . 
UNKNOWN I think you can think about a yellow T_V_ now after a fruit T_V_ or I dunno . 
UNKNOWN It can be an interesting I don't know Yeah , just a lemon T_V_ it'd be yellow lemon . 
UNKNOWN Yes , just lemon . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but y you know the traditional T_V_ it's um Yeah yeah it's flat , yeah the shape is very boring . 
UNKNOWN It's flat , uh Yeah , that's right . 
UNKNOWN Squared ? 
UNKNOWN Could we come up with new T_V_ with such as this kind of T_V_ ? 
UNKNOWN It's really boring , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So you can you have base , triangle base so you the T_V_ you can Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Ah , the lemon T_V_ with the pineapple remote control . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's that would be really interesting , actually . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Because the T_V_ you also Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Oh , that's interesting . 
UNKNOWN You could f we could do a kind of fruit collection of electronics things . 
UNKNOWN Device devi The fruit ? 
UNKNOWN Electronic device . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but just don't trust too much the trends . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause fruit and vegetables it won't last for ten years uh . 
UNKNOWN Maybe Yeah , maybe la next year it will be insects . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , it's But I think it's good to follow the f flow and you know make it now and after , you know , if the people change their mind you change also the product . 
UNKNOWN Maybe two years it's dead . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but this is good because it's not a long long life product . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN T_V_ is more like fifteen years , maybe , so . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah . 
UNKNOWN If you have a lemon lemon T_V_ for fifteen years Yeah , yeah . 
UNKNOWN That's a yeah , yeah . 
UNKNOWN We can think about T_V_ with you know where you can change you know the aspects o like for the cell phones , you know . 
UNKNOWN Customable T_V_ . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , you customise it every ti so every ti if people change , you just change the appearance , and y y you can keep Yeah , you can keep the global appearan The mood of persons , the fashions uh We int Yeah , T_V_ , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Ah such yeah . 
UNKNOWN You've already said mobile phones . 
UNKNOWN Tha that would that would make it . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , and following Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It's interesting , maybe we can create a a line of uh T_V_ with uh a a tr So I think the costs are within the budget . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN A T_V_ for autumn and a T_V_ for winter , you know , so it's So what i and do w is it Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN We're just at twelve fifty Euros . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , the pr at Yeah but I think f it's really a celebrating object . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So do you think you can celebrate your creation ? 
UNKNOWN And you can celebrate your leadership . 
UNKNOWN Oh , thanks a lot . 
THANKS Thank you , mister David Jordan . 
UNKNOWN So it's yellow and very a very ha it's very happy , so . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It's party party remote control . 
UNKNOWN Uh it's it's a pr it's like yeah . 
UNKNOWN The thing now is to to sell it . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , it's your job . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , right , go and sell it . 
UNKNOWN Sell it . 
UNKNOWN Goo and good luck , so It should be fine . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay and the twelve fifty twelve uh twelve Twenty five Euros , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh-huh . 
UNKNOWN Twenty five Euros . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I think it's It's cheap , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Twenty five Euros . 
UNKNOWN It's maybe a little bit expensive . 
UNKNOWN No , I I'm not so happy about the fruit shape , you know . 
UNKNOWN No , it's not so expensive . 
UNKNOWN Wh really ? 
UNKNOWN It should be it should be fine , you know , actually . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN S I I think I like the the colour a the colour are very good , so actually so It's perfect , and I p is th y the the yellow ball thing that Uh f like y we can we can put some uh double R_ Okay yeah , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Maybe what you can do a test . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Put it outside , and if bees come , it's really fruit . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN But don't put sugar in it , it's not working . 
UNKNOWN No , the colours are uh it's perfect , yeah . 
UNKNOWN True . 
UNKNOWN Uh yeah , another thing is the logo is missing still . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but the colour , I think the colour is more is most important , because I I don't think you have ever seen something like that before for a remote control . 
UNKNOWN Uh Still that was one of the requirements we had . 
UNKNOWN It's yeah but it I don't think it's such a problem just putting the logo somewhere . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but we decided to have something yellow and red , for the costs . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So maybe we can just integrate it on th on one side , the double R_ . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN That's actually good idea , so It's not a mushroom . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN So we have the logo , we have the colour , and we have the fashion in electronics , so we have the slogan too . 
UNKNOWN So we have to give a So we have give him give it a cute name . 
UNKNOWN Cute na You cannot say mushroom because it's not the trend . 
UNKNOWN Yeah th no , it's the it's the pineapple control remote control . 
UNKNOWN Mush mushroom controller . 
UNKNOWN It's a pineapple now , it has changed . 
UNKNOWN It's not the trend . 
UNKNOWN It's a pineapple remote controls . 
UNKNOWN It's a pineapple . 
UNKNOWN Pa Pine apple . 
UNKNOWN Pineapple . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , pineapple remote remote control . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but just flying saucer , or I would say flying saucer . 
UNKNOWN With cherry on top . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Oh , that Oh unid uh unidentified remote control , so That's that's pineapple remote control . 
UNKNOWN It's more appropriate , somehow . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN I think it's fine . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Will you buy one ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah I will try I'll try . 
UNKNOWN Try to . 
UNKNOWN Twenty five Euro . 
UNKNOWN Okay uh One thing I like is the shape , because you know it's not like the uh the remote controls you can put in your pocket , on uh in your jacket . 
UNKNOWN I can hel I will try versions so to see how easy easy to manage Yeah I always lose my Yeah , so so i if it is a universal one I can use it with my T_V_ , so it would be I think I would choose this one because of the colour . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah you told me you h you d you d you lost your control your T_V_ so so you need to buy one . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Traditional one ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So this one and this one . 
UNKNOWN What do you choose ? 
UNKNOWN I prefer the laser remote control . 
UNKNOWN What do you choose ? 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN It's it's will enlight your house , your home and your T_V_ , so . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN Maybe next if we decide to do something we'd can put light inside . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah that would be uh an idea . 
UNKNOWN Yeah but that's going to be expensive , you know . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN We had some problems going to twelve Euros and uh I dunno . 
UNKNOWN I think it it would be interesting to just to see if we can if people will buy this one , and maybe add some features to it after yeah . 
UNKNOWN . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , afterwards , if if it's a new trend . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So Champagne , mister Baba . 
UNKNOWN Yeah that's that fine . 
UNKNOWN So we can celebrate now . 
UNKNOWN That's our new product . 
UNKNOWN We should celebrate . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN It's it's fine . 
UNKNOWN It's I like it . 
UNKNOWN So buy one . 
UNKNOWN Next time . 
UNKNOWN Well , I'll buy one here . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So Okay , I will close this . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN No ? 
UNKNOWN So I think we have finished the designing and the evaluation of our remote control and we have a nearly final product . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Our final prototype which yeah . 
UNKNOWN Final prototype , yeah , ye yeah . 
UNKNOWN Final prototype , right . 
UNKNOWN Prototype , yeah . 
UNKNOWN So , thank you very much . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Very productive . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Thanks . 
UNKNOWN S so who is going to take the remote control ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Good morning everybody . 
UNKNOWN Good morning . 
UNKNOWN Oh , everybody is not ready . 
UNKNOWN Uh almost . 
UNKNOWN Ready . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
UNKNOWN Okay , let's go . 
UNKNOWN So , we're here today to to have our first kick-off meeting about uh this new project we're going to tak to talk about in a few minutes . 
UNKNOWN Um so I will be uh Sebastian the Project Manager . 
UNKNOWN Um you are the Okay . 
UNKNOWN I'm uh Michael . 
UNKNOWN I'm the user interface designer . 
UNKNOWN Hi I'm Guillermo . 
UNKNOWN I'm the Marketing Expert . 
UNKNOWN And I am Hemant , the industrial designer . 
UNKNOWN Okay , very good . 
UNKNOWN Thanks for being here . 
UNKNOWN Um so let's have a look to the the agenda. 
UNKNOWN So , we are going to go through this agendauh and mainly first to uh to make to to be used to the tools uh available in this nice and smart meeting room we have here . 
UNKNOWN Um then we'll go to uh the plans for project and have general discussions about it . 
UNKNOWN So , the goal of this project is to uh developed a new remote control . 
UNKNOWN Um it should be original , trendy , and also user friendly . 
UNKNOWN As usual we will follow the the project method um that we are using in the in our company . 
UNKNOWN It is in three step as you know . 
UNKNOWN First the functional design . 
UNKNOWN The second's a conceptual design , and then the detailed design . 
UNKNOWN During each step uh of each design we wi you will work uh s separately , individually on uh your specific tasks and will m we will meet to um to discuss and take decisions about uh what you've you've you did and what uh we will do next . 
UNKNOWN So first , we have to to train ourself with all the um the tools availables in the in this nice meeting room and uh particularly the the white board so uh we are going to go through the white board and take some um s some notesor do some drawings . 
UNKNOWN So who want to start ? 
UNKNOWN Ah well if no one else wants to , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Mister . 
UNKNOWN Okay so , want me to drawmy favourite animal . 
UNKNOWN Let's see . 
UNKNOWN Well , I don't really have a favourite animal , but um uh I think I have one in mind , so uh I'm gonna about the uh spider because you can actually drawit pretty well in the corner of a white board . 
UNKNOWN You have one in mind ? 
UNKNOWN The spider has a spider lives in a web and uh it has eight legs , and uh it can move all about the web in two dimensions . 
UNKNOWN Unless it's a three dimensional web which y they have sometimes . 
UNKNOWN There are some spiders that live in like that have like uh kind of a a big ball of a of a web . 
UNKNOWN And uh the other thing is some spiders can actually uh fly like uh they have uh they let out like uh a stream of like the web building material but it's it acts like a parachute so they can actually kind of go and find new uh build a new web somewhere else . 
UNKNOWN So I think they did this in uh in Charlotte's Web that movie that little uh well it's actually a bookfirst but uh um at the end all the the spiders kinda flew away . 
UNKNOWN So , that's my animal . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Th thank you . 
UNKNOWN Very interesting . 
UNKNOWN Guillermo you want to ? 
UNKNOWN 'kay I dunno why , but when I was a child I I wanted to be a a panther not a pink panther , or maybe yes . 
UNKNOWN But don't you think it's very difficult to drawa panther ? 
UNKNOWN Uh yeah yeah . 
UNKNOWN So bad I don't like it . 
UNKNOWN It would be very funny for us . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN Okay it's a friendly panther . 
UNKNOWN Maybe it's happy 'cause it just ate someone . 
UNKNOWN Yeah maybe . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Actually , honestly I I I dunno what's what's his it's be behaviour , I dunno if if it's the male who who hunts or it's the female uh , I I I have watched that lions di didn't hunt it's the the female lions who who hunt , so but I like it because it's fast , and it's black as well , so it can he it can hide itself very easily and it's it's it looks like um powerful , strong , uh I dunno . 
UNKNOWN I I watch a a film about a black panther when I was a child and I was in that age when everything was shocking me a lot . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
THANKS Thank you . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Hemant . 
UNKNOWN Um sure . 
UNKNOWN So you don't like pink panthers ? 
UNKNOWN I like it . 
UNKNOWN Oh yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Thanks . 
UNKNOWN This lapel is coming out once in a while . 
UNKNOWN It's not very strong . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So , not the favourite animal , but I think I'll drawelephant . 
UNKNOWN I'll try to drawelephant . 
UNKNOWN It's a problem . 
UNKNOWN Okay , thanks . 
UNKNOWN Okay so , elephant goes like this , and then it has four feet . 
UNKNOWN I don't know whether there's any dist there should be any distance or not , but I think this is the easiest . 
UNKNOWN And then we have it's trunk . 
UNKNOWN And yep something like this . 
UNKNOWN An eye , cute . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , so and sometimes they have a hump . 
UNKNOWN Poor elephant . 
UNKNOWN It seems that uh elephants are pretty friendly and they they have one very important way a different way of walking . 
UNKNOWN So when they walk , wherever they are going to put their first feet , the second feet will always be . 
UNKNOWN When they'll come to that position the second , the third feet will be there . 
UNKNOWN That's the way they walk . 
UNKNOWN And that's very peculiar about them . 
UNKNOWN None of the other animals walk like this . 
UNKNOWN And they are very useful to human beings . 
UNKNOWN At least few few hundred years ago when there was no means of transportations or something , or when they had to carry huge um loads from one place to another , elephants were very useful . 
UNKNOWN And they are found in um usually the warm countries . 
UNKNOWN And um they are the biggest terrestrial animal . 
UNKNOWN That's what I know about them . 
UNKNOWN So , that's what I wanted to tell about elephants . 
UNKNOWN So is this uh an Indian or an African elephant , 'cause you haven't drawn the ears ? 
UNKNOWN There are two kind of uh yeah , they are very different , Indian and African elephants . 
UNKNOWN So Indian elephant is having one bump , I think , and the African have two . 
UNKNOWN And then there's a difference in the trunk of the animals , these elephants who are Indian and So at some for some elephants it's the trunk is having one Do we have some message there ? 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN We have to I have to catch you , sorry . 
UNKNOWN Wind up ? 
UNKNOWN Okay , some other time . 
UNKNOWN We have to to go through the meeting . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
THANKS Thank you . 
THANKS Thank you . 
UNKNOWN We can discuss that off-line . 
UNKNOWN Yeah we'll discuss a f a fly or do we'll do another meeting abo on elephants . 
CONFIRMATION Thanks . 
UNKNOWN So so another important part of the project is about money , uh and about so about finances . 
UNKNOWN So we should target selling price of twenty-five Euro for this remote control and uh we have um which which would generate a profit of of um fifty million Euros , okay . 
UNKNOWN And we should target the inter an international market . 
UNKNOWN So could I just ask one question , um is this a stand-alone unit that we're gonna be selling ? 
UNKNOWN So it's gonna be you already have a T_V_ but you're buying an extra remote control for it or something ? 
UNKNOWN O this is the next topic we have to discuss exactly , so let's go to it . 
UNKNOWN Okay , alright . 
UNKNOWN So um we should decide which kind of remote control we want to uh we want to uh we want to go . 
UNKNOWN Should be should should it be um specific remote control to some specific device ? 
UNKNOWN Should it be a universal one ? 
UNKNOWN And uh etcetera . 
UNKNOWN So um so I'm waiting for your for your inputs very quickly because we have only three three minutes to go . 
UNKNOWN Okay well , so , it seems the the first thing that they've kinda specified is the price like based on how much profit we wanna make , which seems to a kind of a little strange if we don't know what the the product is yet , but I guess if that's if that's the requirement that we need to to design the the product to actually fit that that price bracket so , I guess we're gonna need to find out what's actually you know , what people ar are willing to pay for um what kind of product they're expecting for twenty-five Euro because it seems quite a lot for a remote control , so it's Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Okay I think this is more a job to our market person yeah . 
UNKNOWN Marketing person . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So it should be the topic of maybe of the next meeting just to to have an overview of this and uh in which direction we should go . 
UNKNOWN So we need to close the meeting . 
UNKNOWN Uh we'll have a new meeting soon and uh so the work every every of you ha have t d to do . 
UNKNOWN So um you have to work on the on the working design , you have to uh work on the technical functions , and uh you have to work on us user requirements specs , alright ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um you will receive some information by emails , i as usual . 
UNKNOWN Thanks for coming today . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Thanks . 
CONFIRMATION Thanks . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
UNKNOWN Okay everybody is ready ? 
UNKNOWN Good morning again . 
UNKNOWN So , today we are going to have a f second meeting . 
UNKNOWN Oh Michael , hi . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN You're late . 
UNKNOWN You have a good reason for that ? 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
CONFIRMATION Very good . 
UNKNOWN Okay , let's have a look to the agendatoday . 
UNKNOWN So , we are going to have a meeting about the functional design . 
UNKNOWN Um so first before starting I w just going to uh to go quickly to through the minutesof previous meeting . 
UNKNOWN So uh basically we we are not decided if w we should go for a universal or specific uh uh remote control , but I have new um new i inputs for about that topics . 
UNKNOWN I goin I'm going to share with you . 
UNKNOWN And uh basically we decided to um to uh go to individual actions for each of you uh so um Industrial Designer should wor was supposed to work on th on th on the working design . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN You showed us you ar you you prepare something for us ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN The U_I_ guy also uh work on that , yeah , and for the mar our Marketing Expert should deliver some specs . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Alright so so we are going to go through three of your individual presentations. 
UNKNOWN But first I would like quickly to uh to decide of to give a name to the project . 
UNKNOWN So , I just put d quickly Remo , but if you have any o other names that we co could decide for just to to keep something fun for our project we we should we could discuss quickly . 
UNKNOWN Any ideas ? 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Uh the Powerstick . 
UNKNOWN Powerstick , yeah . 
UNKNOWN What else ? 
UNKNOWN What else ? 
CONFUSION Uh . 
UNKNOWN Maybe a Spanish name would work well . 
UNKNOWN Mm I was thinking of the Mando . 
UNKNOWN Especially if we're selling into the U_S_ market becasue there's a lot of Spanish speakers there . 
UNKNOWN Maybe something that sounds cool in English but sounds funny in Spanish . 
UNKNOWN Mando . 
UNKNOWN What is that ? 
UNKNOWN Mango ? 
UNKNOWN Mango ? 
UNKNOWN Mando . 
UNKNOWN Mando . 
UNKNOWN M_A_ ? 
UNKNOWN M_A_ ? 
UNKNOWN A_N_ yeah D_O . 
UNKNOWN M_ D_O_ . 
UNKNOWN Mm , okay . 
UNKNOWN It doesn't it doesn't sound cool for me , but maybe for a Spanish for I for Control . 
UNKNOWN What does it mean ? 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN What does it mean in Spanish ? 
UNKNOWN Control . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Nice . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause it also like in English it sounds like you know the man's tool you know because you know men like to have control of the remote so it might The Mando . 
UNKNOWN But mm , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Mando sounds Latino . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So , let's go for Mando ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah . 
UNKNOWN No objection ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah that's . 
CONFIRMATION Great . 
UNKNOWN And we could have some like you d you could have the fonts you know special , so you have man in like in in uh in one o in one font and then the O_ as like Although you don't wanna cut uh cut women out of the uh potential buyers though , do you ? 
UNKNOWN So Okay , I think this is Okay . 
UNKNOWN So Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah they are the most T_V_ watcher . 
UNKNOWN So we should be careful . 
UNKNOWN Okay , I think this is more a question of of I I think this is more a question of of look and feel . 
UNKNOWN But yeah it uh Yeah because if the product will be international Maybe maybe I should uh start . 
UNKNOWN Marketing . 
UNKNOWN Something that should be addressed later . 
UNKNOWN We should we should go to other for the other topics . 
UNKNOWN Well that's the thing . 
UNKNOWN We need to know who we're selling it to before we can really decide on a Um . 
UNKNOWN Yeah okay , so let's stick f to Man Mando for the name and we'll see for the for the look and feel later . 
UNKNOWN So let's go for the three presentationsright now . 
UNKNOWN So , who want to start ? 
UNKNOWN So maybe we could start with the market , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Okay so I have your slidessomewhere ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Should be in participant four . 
UNKNOWN Participant four . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah . 
UNKNOWN This one ? 
CONFUSION Uh . 
UNKNOWN S that's coming . 
UNKNOWN Uh okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
CONFIRMATION Great . 
UNKNOWN Okay so yeah I will I will give a brief outline about what I what I prepared for this meeting . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN For the functional requirements and especially for the for the user requirements . 
UNKNOWN I prepare a marketing reportand we have to find the weaknesses and and the the improvements we could do to the current remote controls . 
UNKNOWN And also I di I did a study with for the incorporation of new technologies it seems that the remote controls have been have remained the same for the last five , ten years . 
UNKNOWN There is no no significant difference between the the b the first new controls and Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Sh next slide? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well more most of the people think that remote controls are ugly , thoroughly . 
UNKNOWN So and they they admit that the the they should uh s they would uh spend more money in a fancier remote control , which is which is good and it's interesting point . 
UNKNOWN Also the people are worried about about the R_S_I_ disease , which is if you repeat the sa the same movement , which is not a with a not very appropriate device , you you will have problems whe when you will get old . 
UNKNOWN So s people are uh are worried about the the shape of the of the remote control . 
UNKNOWN They are also they get angry very often because they lost the remote control very often , so I think it would be a good point to to l to to find a a solution to any beep any alarm or something incorporated to with the remote control every time it it get lost . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN And also I found that young people the the younger people are the more interested they are in incorporating new technologies in the in the remote control . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So in my opinion the Mando this Mando shouldn't be very small because the smaller it is , the more like the the liklier it is to get lost . 
UNKNOWN Liklier or more likely ? 
UNKNOWN More likely . 
UNKNOWN likely . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Uh people also complain because they they they all have the same size of the buttons for buttons who w which are not very use like f uh memorising channels or or this kind of actions which are not very often but they they shouldn't they shouldn't have the same importance in the in the uh in the remote cont in the remote control . 
UNKNOWN Also the z the design should fit the hand shape . 
UNKNOWN So it may be interesting to to think in a in both prototypes , for right and left handed people . 
UNKNOWN Well th the on the thing is though , most remote controls are used by more than one person . 
UNKNOWN So unless you're kind of targeting single people you know you're gonna maybe cut out some a lot of your market . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I dunno I th Anyway I think it could be int interesting to to release some a a small fraction of of this remote controls . 
UNKNOWN Well maybe it could be a universal design . 
CONFUSION Sorry ? 
UNKNOWN A universal design , which is which is good for both the hands . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Still shaped for yeah for your hand but not for a particular hand , right ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah ? 
UNKNOWN That's right , whether it's left hand or right hand , but but don't you think that the two points are clashing , one thing you are saying design should fit the hand shape and it should not be very small ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Sorry ? 
UNKNOWN The first and the third point , they are clashing . 
UNKNOWN Well it can still be a , you can still extend past the hand . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Like uh Yeah , like No no I was thinking of so like something yeah . 
CONFUSION Uh . 
UNKNOWN So fitting the hand doesn't mean much then . 
UNKNOWN Well it means like , this remote here is kind of is very thin and long so instead of having you know you might have it kind of a bit bigger or , you know , with maybe some some finger molds or something . 
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm mm-hmm mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So it means design should be similar to the traditional ones ? 
UNKNOWN Little sleek , longer ? 
UNKNOWN And it should fit the hand . 
UNKNOWN Something with the shape of the palm ? 
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm mm-hmm mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Some finger grips maybe . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN You could even have some buttons like you know on the sides and everything , but Yeah . 
UNKNOWN On the sides . 
UNKNOWN Yeah yeah . 
UNKNOWN It sh it shouldn't it shouldn't be symmetric symmetrical . 
UNKNOWN Mm-hm mm-hmm mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Not anymore . 
UNKNOWN That's what yeah . 
UNKNOWN And then finally Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And finally , the incorporation of a L_C_D_ or a speech recognition system in the remote control could also be interesting , but I don't know if the budget would be large enough . 
UNKNOWN First I'm just wondering about the L_C_D_ stuff because uh because Yeah , so maybe it's a good time for me to uh to bring you to some new uh new informations . 
UNKNOWN But most of yeah most of the young people to thirty to thirty years old were really interested in this kind of technology . 
UNKNOWN We had the new requirements from the so uh from the head offices of the company , and so they wanted so they want to um they would like to be restricted to T_V_ . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay , I dunno if you had this information already . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN No , so they want us to restrict the remote control to T_V_ only because of time limitations . 
UNKNOWN Um they want also uh Excellent . 
UNKNOWN Actually this marketing reportis restricted to T_V_ remote controls . 
UNKNOWN So we have also to focus more on the internet aspects because well well te teletext is outdated now and uh finally , it should be clear that the corporate image , that means colours and logos of the co our company should be clearly inde identified in the product . 
UNKNOWN So Yeah yeah . 
UNKNOWN I was still uh I was still working on this uh twenty five Euro price point because I think actually having looked at some of the remotes out there , this is quite a low uh price if if we're maybe I can get to this in my presentationthough , but um yeah . 
UNKNOWN Sure sure . 
UNKNOWN So maybe we can jump to your presentations, right now . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Okay so let's keep in mind about tha that that this last point about L_C_D_ and speech uh reco Sorry , what is your ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think even even if it was within budget do a speech reco rec system it might be a bit difficult because if you think if you're watching T_V_ you're gonna have a lot of this uh background noise from the T_V_ which might interfere with the Uh participant three . 
UNKNOWN You might have some background noise from the T_V_ which will make the speech recognition much uh harder , so . 
UNKNOWN Yeah but you should be able to activate or disactivate , so yeah yeah . 
UNKNOWN Oh you press a press a button to talk , and the the T_V_ the T_V_ sound turns off . 
UNKNOWN Yeah uh channel fifty . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN No it could be command control kind of thing . 
UNKNOWN It requir recognises particular sequence and then it gets activated . 
UNKNOWN Means you say you should say like does that , remote control being on or be on kind of thing , and then remote control comes in the picture for the speech recognition . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Because this kind of thing means speech is there from the T_V_ also . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So there should be something command controlled , you start and then you stop . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It's like V_I_ editor , you are having two modes similarly . 
UNKNOWN Otherwise it's just lying idle . 
UNKNOWN Okay Michael . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so , could I describe the mouse maybe be easier to could I use the mouse , or Mm . 
CONFUSION Sorry ? 
UNKNOWN Um yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Thanks . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN The wheel doesn't work . 
CONFIRMATION Great . 
UNKNOWN Okay so um while uh researching this this topic I first of all just thought of a couple of things that I would like to see in a remote , and just uh looked to see if they're actually available in any current remotes , and then also searched for which are the top-rated uh remote controls on Epinions dot com , which is a a you know a a customer um written basically review site . 
UNKNOWN So um there's a pretty wide range of uh remote controls these days and and uh this remote control on the right here is is one of the more extravagant , but it's not really it's by no means uh mm you know on it's own in being so expensive . 
UNKNOWN There are a lot of expensive remote controls out there . 
UNKNOWN Looks like a P_D_A_ ? 
UNKNOWN So yeah it doe it's well basically all the functions uh are controlled through through the L_C_D_ screen except for the really really kind of main functions , which have a couple of of their own buttons . 
UNKNOWN Um and if you look at a lot of the universal remotes out um on the market , I know we're working on television remote , but a lot of the universal remotes out there have uh have these L_C_D_ screens which kind of helps when you're using multiple uh devices I suppose because you can have multiple kind of functions d different functions on the screen at different times . 
UNKNOWN But um the thing that I find most interesting about this remote control , and it's kind of difficult to uh to see in the slide, but it has a scroll wheel on it , which is kind of like uh a mouse scroll wheel , which I think is it's a really kind of important design aspect um is it's 'Cause the thing is what a what we the presen this presentationwe had is what we want the remote control to actually do . 
UNKNOWN And obviously the the simplest thing that a remote control does is it just change the change the channel . 
UNKNOWN Change the channels . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Now um uh the I think that a scroll wheel is actually pretty a pretty handy way of of changing the channel . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause I know when I um when I use the remote to change the channel I very rarely use the numbers on the on the pad . 
UNKNOWN Mmm-hmm mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN I usually use the up and down because most channels are you know two digit numbers and you have to press you know a special button to enter a two-digit number , and then two numbers , so that's just uh it's annoying . 
UNKNOWN Yeah yeah . 
UNKNOWN So I think a scroll wheel is is quite handy . 
UNKNOWN Now um the the scroll wheel is is much more useful if you have an L_C_D_ screen , and this brings us to the the point you were mentioning before about the internet uh capability . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN One possibility , if we now we need to still talk about the price point because obviously a lot of this stuff can't be done for twenty five Eu uh Euro , but one possibility is to download program information into the L_C_D_ screen so that instead of actually saying I want to I want to go to channel thirty seven because I know this programme's on , you know , often you don't know what ch what channel it's on , or you don't know what's on . 
UNKNOWN If you have a list of of programs on your L_C_D_ screen you just scroll to that program rather than to a channel . 
UNKNOWN So if you think about it's kind of like a you know in mobile phones now you don't use you don't remember people's phone number , you remember their name and you go find that name and ring it . 
UNKNOWN So this would be pretty kind of a handy thing to have , but um we we really need t to discuss the price . 
UNKNOWN So , I mean there are there are uh cheaper this is another multi kinda purpose remote control where it's it's it's very simple , there's only a few buttons , but al each of those buttons does something different in a different context . 
UNKNOWN So this is something else we might wanna consider , is really kind of limiting the number of buttons , because this is the top rating uh universal remote control on on Epinions . 
UNKNOWN It it's really uh maybe worth thinking about limiting the number of buttons as much as as possible um because really I think people want to be able to find the button they're looking for without even looking at the remote control . 
UNKNOWN And was saying before about having different size buttons for different you know frequently used uh tasks , but I think also you know the location and and shape of the buttons is important , but also the number of buttons . 
UNKNOWN So if you have too many buttons it it it increases the the difficulty of finding the one you want . 
UNKNOWN But there is one problem then the user has to understand each of that functionality . 
UNKNOWN So Yeah well we w Yeah well we will have a bit of a simpler uh task in that we're only doing uh a television remote control . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Because the same button is doing too many things . 
UNKNOWN Um I think maybe one option is to have you know a little flip-open um door that uh that you have hidden most of the time , but contains the extra buttons like , say , the number buttons for instance . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um I I would if I had my perfect remote control , I'd probably just have no numbers at all on it because they're just in the way . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN They don't really do anything . 
UNKNOWN Maybe you know I although I do also find flip-open doors a bit of a pain because sometimes they can break off or or whatever , but maybe a door that you can you can permanantly remove or permanantly have on would be good . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um but I think definitely you need to to keep the buttons down to a minimum , but not not let that kind of interfere with the functionality of of the device . 
UNKNOWN Um Well I guess that depends on how you market it . 
UNKNOWN H I think I think that the tr the transition to this to this new remote control shouldn't be very very abrupt very hard because w if people see a remo see the see a remote control without numbers mm they will think it's very difficult to learn very difficult to very different build very different to the traditional If y I'm sure if you can sell a a speech recognition remote control for twenty five Euros everyo everyone will s will buy it . 
UNKNOWN It does sampling out of the . 
UNKNOWN If you if you have the right advertisement showing how how how easy it is and how you can , you know , navigate to a program without the numbers , then people might say that looks pretty easy . 
UNKNOWN Okay , can you continue , please Mi ? 
UNKNOWN So , but yep . 
UNKNOWN Um okay , so , I think um one of the really kind of useful things you can do with with internet connectivity would be to have this a programme driven interface rather than the channel number . 
UNKNOWN So if we can have a higher priced uh remote control I think that would really be worth uh something that would be worth implementing . 
UNKNOWN Um mm there's the L_C_D_ screen , um which maybe maybe is too expensive , um but I think also at the scroll wheel , I haven't mentioned it here , the scroll wheel could be used without an L_C_D_ screen , just for changing channel numbers easily . 
UNKNOWN I think even that , I mean , that would be a fairly cheap thing , compared to an L_C_D_ screen , to implement , um but I think that would be quite useful as well . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN And the other thing , you say we need to we need to keep it just television , but I think one maybe one option , since this is supposed to be a kind of a fashionable device , is you know there's a certain kind of cool or wow factor that you can kind of you can have with technology , and maybe we wanna make it something that's extensible to do other tasks . 
UNKNOWN Say you have like um a little another little kind of base unit that can also receive signals as well as the television where you can , say uh , change the lighting in the room . 
UNKNOWN You know that would be something maybe you could sell as an extra , so that it doesn't have to be part of the initial development , but , you know , later on you could you can you know you also , selling the potential of the device . 
UNKNOWN Then you say potentially you can then do other cool stuff like change the lights , I dunno , close the windows , whatever , turn the heating on , and um , I think that's something we may need to have as as at least as an optional extra to to kinda make our product cool , since we say we're putting the fashion in electronics . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Okay , thanks . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN you want to go ? 
UNKNOWN So yeah . 
UNKNOWN So most of the things which we are discussing about is speech recognition uh , that means on my own I yeah , it should be . 
UNKNOWN This one ? 
CONFIRMATION Great . 
UNKNOWN No , not that one . 
UNKNOWN you are two . 
UNKNOWN Two . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
UNKNOWN Okay so the working design is uh user i interface could be of two types , one is the usual press buttons which are there so that the user feels that he is knoing doing some he is knowing about that technology . 
UNKNOWN So he is pretty comfortable if he wants to get this , and on top of that there there could be a speech recognition technology also being sitting on the on the remote . 
UNKNOWN So the old kind of users who don't want to have any changes , it can it can be useful for them , and the new users , as uh our Marketing Expert was saying , they can use the new gizmo which is speech recognition kind of thing . 
UNKNOWN Okay , sorry to interrupt you , but we have seen before that there is a new way of interacting that use wheel . 
UNKNOWN That's right . 
UNKNOWN So anyway , that didn't come into my mind , so th that is a possibility . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN These could be other kind of interfaces . 
UNKNOWN Means we can have , depending on the cost , how much we can afford , we can have different kind of interfaces . 
UNKNOWN So spe buttons are something which is very everybody is familiar with . 
UNKNOWN So if you go to the market and you say that buttons are there the people know what it is , and on top of that if we are having extra functionality people are willing to shell that twenty-five Euros money which we are thinking . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Otherwise we are just like others in the market . 
UNKNOWN So anyway that is the first , user interface could be of more than one type , and uh yeah that means we can do the on-line changes which which cannot be done now actually . 
UNKNOWN So apart from the speech , we can have the scroll kind of thing with the buttons . 
UNKNOWN Now for buttons , normal requirements like bit coding and all those things are required . 
UNKNOWN And for voice , limited vocabulary automatic speech recognition system is required and we require a microphone also to be sitting there on the remote . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN That increases the the cost also . 
UNKNOWN Uh that's right . 
UNKNOWN But uh means we have to see how much what kind of microphones and stuff like that . 
UNKNOWN Do you think that performance of such systems are enough to to target well of such technologies is enough ? 
UNKNOWN Uh yes , if it is limited vocabulary usually it's enough . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah we we can uh target , means we can target ninety five percent accuracy or somewhere ninety seven perc That's right . 
UNKNOWN Well wh uh I imagine also that the microphone will be an ambiance um a um an ambience microphones because you are not going to speak into into th into the remote control . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN No it it could be little d yeah it could be That's right . 
UNKNOWN So it could be s a few centimetres . 
UNKNOWN Well one one other thing that that speech recognition could really blow out the price for is uh when you want to sell into other markets , though , because , I'm not sure exactly where we're gonna sell this , but I presume it's not gonna just be English speaking countries . 
UNKNOWN That's right . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So then you have to s you know , you have to train models for Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Uh it's more like , means there are different speech technologies which are existing so D_T_W_ could be kind of which is the easiest . 
UNKNOWN So you have to store some templates on the on the on the chip itself , and it's just dynamic time warping where you try to find out what it is , instead of having a model which has to be trained and being a micro-controller . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Okay we shou we should discuss this la later after after after this this uh slide. 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's right . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So we can That's right . 
UNKNOWN This is a this is a this is a a very important uh issue in discussion . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN Okay , next . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN Uh that finished ? 
UNKNOWN No no . 
UNKNOWN Components . 
UNKNOWN No ? 
UNKNOWN Components ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So , will you go to the next slide? 
UNKNOWN Yes sure . 
UNKNOWN Yeah so this is the design which we are thinking so . 
UNKNOWN We are having a power button and the switch , which is not much , and then we are having the which is to indicate whether the power is on or not . 
UNKNOWN And then there are two kind of things which can be so one is the button interface which has not been shown because because of lack of time . 
UNKNOWN So we could not put that . 
UNKNOWN So now where the A_S_R_ decoder is sitting , similarly there are different kind of interfaces which could be there . 
UNKNOWN So there is A_S_R_ decoder which could be there , and then there could be another scroll button scroll scroller , and then there could be buttons , and all of them they will just do the decoding and put it in the math put it in the proper message format . 
UNKNOWN And then there is there is the chip which is sitting , the green one , and it converts it into bit codes , and that bit codes are sent by the infrared device to the receiver . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So this is the easiest design the there could be . 
UNKNOWN So th an A_S_R_ decoder we can have things in . 
UNKNOWN To have different technologies . 
UNKNOWN So this was the my personal preference was that we can have A_S_R_ sitting there on the remote control . 
UNKNOWN You know I guess you could actually train the remote control as you're using it by saying you know turn volume up , and you press the uh press the button like uh s people teach sign language to kids f well , by speaking and doing Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah but uh as soon as you try to put the microchip kind of thing or something the price will go up . 
UNKNOWN So these are the slight problems . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So your your opinion is that we should go for special condition technologies ? 
UNKNOWN Because yeah the reason is that if we go into the market means though I don't have much idea , but as he the uh Marketing Expert presentationwas So if we go with just the Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Actually I'm not so sure because I'm the you know if I was using a remote control to , say , turn the volume up because I can't hear it very well , I don't really want to you know drown out what people are saying by talking you know when I'm when I'm instead of pressing up on on a remote control . 
UNKNOWN I'm sure . 
UNKNOWN You know if there's some there's some dialogue all of a sudden that I can't hear , I'm trying to actually find out what's being said , so maybe speech recognition gets in the way more than it helps . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay so Okay gentlemens , we have to take some deci decisions right now . 
UNKNOWN Yeah but you know the the average frequency of pushing buttons , it's about it's about eighty eighty eighty pushes per hour , or something like that . 
UNKNOWN Well it depends if it's a remote control th Maybe if the remote control is something that y you don't actually have to pick up anymore , that would be a a useful feature of the speech recogntion . 
UNKNOWN If you can leave it sitting on the table and you don't actually have to find it , then that could be . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
UNKNOWN Um so if I if I kind of summarise everything we've de we we said . 
UNKNOWN We are targeting T_V_ . 
UNKNOWN We need we need to have um um remote control which is fanc fancy , which is uh which is easy to to hand not too small , not too big . 
UNKNOWN Um we have or good shape , yes . 
UNKNOWN With a good shape for the Yeah . 
UNKNOWN We should bring new technologies for young peoples , and uh as we have uh also requirements to to use uh to to push thr toward the internet . 
UNKNOWN Maybe this is something we can stick to it . 
UNKNOWN And um also , a very interesting things I I I've seen on on on the one of the comp o our competitor is this wheel that we can use to navigate . 
UNKNOWN So so my feeling is that re regarding costs budget we have an an an target price , it's not possible to go s to go to L_C_D_ and also to go to automatic speech recognition technologies . 
UNKNOWN Uh first m m why not to go to L_C_D_ . 
UNKNOWN Because um in fact as we are targeting uh T_V_ in fact we can use T_V_ screen as a screen to feedback to to give some feedback informations about what we could have . 
UNKNOWN Well it depends though well it depends . 
UNKNOWN If we we don't unless we have some input some video input to the T_V_ or we have control over the T_V_ then we can't actually display that . 
UNKNOWN Like if we if we produce the T_V_s then then yeah we can put you know menus up up there , but otherwise we need to actually have some kind of something sitting in between the video signal and the and the T_V_ to superimpose those those menus . 
UNKNOWN So that's an extra cost . 
UNKNOWN Yeah that's right . 
UNKNOWN Don don't you ha don't we have contacts with uh people on T_V_ or or well systems that exist that we can use ? 
UNKNOWN Well this is this is another que we still haven't really defined the remote . 
UNKNOWN Are we still you say we're focusing on T_V_ , but is it still a kind of like a universal remote in that it's a replacement remote control , or is this something for our own line of of televisions ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause that really makes a big difference . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause even if we have contacts we can't really produce a remote control that can bring up menus on other other companies' T_V_s . 
UNKNOWN It's just there are too many T_V_s out there . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It's it's not really gonna For twenty five Euro ? 
UNKNOWN That's good point . 
UNKNOWN What's what cou what could be the cost of uh well , could we fit the the targets uh in terms of cost uh if we go s to L_C_D_ on the remote control ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It's not possible . 
UNKNOWN I think it's impossible . 
UNKNOWN It's impossible . 
UNKNOWN But but I dunno , I think um it would be good to know if there is any leverage in that any leeway in that um that twenty five Euro because for twenty five Euro I think all we can really do is provide a very basic remote control , and that seems to be kind of against the philosophy of our company which is you know putting the fashion into electronics . 
UNKNOWN So I would I would like to know if there's any chance of of increasing the uh of increasing the unit price . 
UNKNOWN Uh What would be Wha but what would be one question , what would be the goal of putting an L_C_D_ in a remote control ? 
UNKNOWN So you mean yo you mean we we should target something maybe which is which would be more expensive but re really fancy in terms to um in terms to had to have really an added value ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah because yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so regarding the automatic speech recognition , I think this is They have tele teletext . 
UNKNOWN Well th 'Cause you can have things like the programme name instead of the channel numbers , like an interactive programme guide . 
UNKNOWN What what kind of information ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah but mo most of the T_V_s nowadays show the show the the n Yeah but yeah most of the T_V_s have teletext nowadays . 
UNKNOWN Well , because they have teletext on it . 
UNKNOWN Th th you have a teletext sin signal that you can that you can uh that you can get thr through the channel . 
UNKNOWN They have t most of them have teletext , but we want to get rid well one of our requirements is to uh to move to teletext to uh to the use of internet . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So to to uh to browse more easily the teletext . 
UNKNOWN You can get a lot more information on it . 
UNKNOWN For instance through uh through your remote control . 
UNKNOWN So what would what would appear in the in the L_C_D_ ? 
UNKNOWN So you could have the name of the programme , you could have um the start time you know where it's up to . 
UNKNOWN The ti the start time , all the p all the programmes you could have uh o Well I don't know if this information is available from teletext , also . 
UNKNOWN You could have a l even a little image of you know the c you know the the m the main actors or something so you can quickly just kind of even without reading Well no , but there are the electronic programme guides out there . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Are But just a small thing , what kind of market we are targeting ? 
UNKNOWN They may not have pictures , but maybe they do . 
UNKNOWN There's dependi it also depends on the country . 
UNKNOWN Well because for the same reason that we cannot uh informations on the T_V_ . 
UNKNOWN We c we couldn't grab information information which is not there . 
UNKNOWN No but I mean with the internet you have flexibility of where you get your information from . 
UNKNOWN So it may be possible that there are people out there providing that . 
UNKNOWN So so that mean w w we need an in an extra internet connection to use the remote control , if you want to browse , in addition to the T_V_ , or uh or it should be a special T_V_ connected to Okay . 
UNKNOWN But Yeah . 
CONFUSION Uh . 
UNKNOWN Well I I think if we're gonna I think we would definitely need the internet connection because even with y I don't think you could even get teletext information from the T_V_ onto the remote control , especially if we don't control the T_V_ . 
UNKNOWN I dunno . 
UNKNOWN We need to find that out . 
UNKNOWN We need to close the meeting . 
UNKNOWN Um so Very quickly . 
UNKNOWN Is it that we are targeting the replacement remote market , or what ? 
UNKNOWN So the remote has gone bad and the person wants to buy a new remote or because the cost of L_C_D_ thing could be as high as the T_V_ itself . 
UNKNOWN That is very important . 
NEGATION No . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN If it's a really small T_V_ maybe . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , well people go to buy another remote control when they broke n broke their , and they want to go t for universal one , and they take the fanciest they can have . 
UNKNOWN Broke . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So this is that we z that that we should target . 
UNKNOWN So the com the um the uh the committment is the following , we don't go for speech recognition technology . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN The L_C_D_ is still on disc is still open to discussion . 
UNKNOWN It is up to you to go through this um uh this way and to to reportreportme back next meeting . 
UNKNOWN So Yeah , but not sure . 
UNKNOWN I think that the speech recognition technology would be cheaper the than the L_C_D_ . 
UNKNOWN It's it's cheaper as compared to the L_C_D_ . 
UNKNOWN Maybe it's cheaper , but we have no Okay this is this is an open question for you . 
UNKNOWN Because with the L_C_D_ you need more requirements . 
UNKNOWN You need a internet connection . 
UNKNOWN You need m more things . 
UNKNOWN But for the speech recognition you you don't need anything . 
UNKNOWN Well the thing is I think I think the type of peop I think the type of people that are gonna want to buy a very stylish rem r remote control with lots of new technologies are the kinda people that are gonna have you know a wireless internet connection maybe , or a you know . 
UNKNOWN You just say channel fifty , and that's it . 
UNKNOWN But then we should move to another target b because at twenty five Dollars , it's To move to another target ? 
UNKNOWN Means th yeah twenty five Euros is yeah , that's right . 
UNKNOWN Well this is what we need to find out . 
UNKNOWN Can we can we increase the the price point of this remote control ? 
UNKNOWN 'Cause otherwise we need It's kind of hard to guarantee that you're gonna Ninety five percent is not good enough though . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN This is uh up to you to tell us . 
UNKNOWN But I'm definitely not keen on to to no no no , I'm no I'm definit definitely not keen on going to speech recognition technologies . 
UNKNOWN I'm not confident enough . 
UNKNOWN I'm not sure that that we'll have a product really that work . 
UNKNOWN I uh that work It's real yeah . 
UNKNOWN How to guarantee such performances is really hard . 
UNKNOWN the expert uh said ninety five percent . 
UNKNOWN Well this is still is is very bad . 
UNKNOWN So , this is the end of this discussion . 
UNKNOWN Next meeting uh here are the task you have to work on . 
UNKNOWN Um so you have to work on the component uh concept . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Uh you have to work on user interface , and you have to go through a trend watching . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So the question is still open about the L_C_D_ thing . 
UNKNOWN Um uh we I hope that next meeting we will uh we'll take some um decision that direction . 
CONFIRMATION Thanks . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
FAREWELL Bye . 
UNKNOWN Okay ? 
UNKNOWN Good afternoon . 
UNKNOWN Hope you have good lunch . 
UNKNOWN Afternoon . 
GREETING Hi . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , we had falafel . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN Nice . 
UNKNOWN And you ? 
UNKNOWN Uh , yes , I had something similar but non-vegetarian . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So today is um our third meeting . 
UNKNOWN It will be about the conceptual design uh . 
UNKNOWN If I come back to uh the minutesof the last meetings um . 
UNKNOWN We decided not to go for speech recognition technologies because of some reasons and we are not decided about u the use of L_C_D_ screen on on the remote control because of costs . 
UNKNOWN So maybe we cou wi will be able to clarify this this question to today . 
UNKNOWN Uh at the end of the meeting we should take decision on that point . 
UNKNOWN So I hope uh that your respective pr presentationsuh will help us . 
UNKNOWN So each of you have some presentatio presentationto perform um who starts ? 
UNKNOWN So marketing . 
UNKNOWN So you are you saved your y your presentationsomewhere ? 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN So you're four ? 
UNKNOWN Four , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Which is trend watch . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Mr Marketing Experts . 
UNKNOWN Yeah that's me . 
UNKNOWN So Mm-hmm . 
CONFUSION Uh . 
UNKNOWN Well I investigate the preference more d I investigate deeper the preference of the users . 
UNKNOWN Uh so the the current investigation th uh th uh sorry the current the n current trends ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Well wha what I found um can you Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Next slide? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
THANKS Thank you . 
UNKNOWN What I found in order of importance from less to more important is that people want an easy to use device . 
UNKNOWN After they they want something new technologic technologically speaking , but the most what they what they find more more interesting , more or more important it's uh a fancy look and feel instead of uh instead of the current the current trend which was f the functional look and feel . 
UNKNOWN So now more more cool aspect , ma more a cooler aspect uh rather than a device with many functions and many buttons with instead of i instead of ha of a device which can do many things , a device which is pleasant to to watch , to see . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Uh also Well in in Euro in in Paris and and Milan the in Paris and in Paris and Milan the the current trend of uh of clothes , furniture and all this all this fashion it's it's fruit and the the the theme is fruit and vegetables . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN And also in the in the U_S_A_ the the current the mor the most popular feeling it's it's a spongy . 
UNKNOWN Spongy means eponge ? 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So maybe we should we should think in in this direction , so Fruit vegetables is the the new have you seen the last exposition of clothes in Milan ? 
UNKNOWN What what do you mean by fruit and vegetables and spongy ? 
UNKNOWN What you mean clothe No , I missed that one . 
UNKNOWN Spongy means it it's like sp But what's your suggestion how we can have some shape like that on the remote ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I I didn't miss an I didn't miss and I saw that the fruit , there are many fr pictures of fruits and vegetables in the clothes . 
UNKNOWN Oh , they're okay so they're not like dressed as a carrot they just have like pictures of fruit on , okay . 
UNKNOWN No no , not not yet , not yet . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah . 
UNKNOWN So we're not gonna have a remote control in the shape of of a banana , just maybe Okay and So which fruit are you thinking of ? 
UNKNOWN So te textu textures , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Vegetable textures and all this kind . 
UNKNOWN Drawings of bananas . 
UNKNOWN Uh yeah , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh-huh . 
UNKNOWN Well so this is in the next slidecertainly . 
UNKNOWN Uh no no , it's not . 
UNKNOWN It's not ? 
UNKNOWN It's And Um . 
UNKNOWN I ha I haven't thought of any particular fruit , but the general aspect of the of the remote control may may could remind some kind of vegetable , some kind of instead of vegetable , some natur mm uh natural object or something . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN But yeah it it depends on the Yeah maybe the shape the shape No , not n not not too much focus , not too much focu not n not too s not too similar to a fruit because next year the ten the trend the trend will be different . 
UNKNOWN So maybe you maybe you can display a banana on the L_C_D_ . 
UNKNOWN Oh , so you want the remote control to be the shape of a fruit , or you want just some kind of like fruit logo on the So something that looks half like a fruit and half like an elephant . 
UNKNOWN Means buttons are in the shape of fruits , buttons are in the frape shape of fruits or something , apple , banana , something like that . 
UNKNOWN Apple for channel one . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So we shouldn't be at re really attached to to the trend but For instance , yeah . 
UNKNOWN African or as an elephant ? 
UNKNOWN That we can discuss afterwards . 
UNKNOWN But okay , I'm not , I'm not really sure if uh that would really appeal to everyone though , maybe just to fashion gurus , like maybe just like a little bit n a little fruit picture somewhere in the corner , but I don't know about uh I dunno how ergonomic a , an orange is . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Well ma maybe we we should further specify what target are we focusing . 
UNKNOWN I think in my opinion we should focus on on young people because they are more open to new devi new devices and also yeah according to the marketing reportninety p ninety five percent of young people was was was able to to buy a a n a cooler remote control . 
UNKNOWN To fruit ? 
UNKNOWN But is it uh is fruit cool ? 
UNKNOWN What ? 
UNKNOWN That's a question . 
UNKNOWN What ? 
UNKNOWN Is fruit cool ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah ? 
UNKNOWN Uh Is the new trend of the No I think we we should think about a a shape with it a device with a shape of some Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well I guess , you know , Apple has the iPod so , imagi just 'cause they have an apple on their on their product , doesn't mean fruit is cool . 
UNKNOWN Okay , but it has to be easy to uh to use though and to hold you know , you don't wanna pear or a watermelon . 
UNKNOWN Don don't you think we can find uh the shape of a fruit which is handy to use ? 
UNKNOWN Well , probably the only thing is a banana that I can think of , a cucumber . 
UNKNOWN Banana . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN I dunno . 
UNKNOWN Or m Maybe . 
UNKNOWN Maybe too long . 
CONFUSION Maybe . 
UNKNOWN Too green . 
UNKNOWN So , but I mean you also have to you have to also have , fit r all the buttons and you know . 
UNKNOWN A banana . 
UNKNOWN Um Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It's , it The thing is you have t normally with um with buttons , they have to be at some point attached to a circuit board so if you're gonna have things like on a cylindrical kind of device it may be difficult to kind of to build . 
UNKNOWN I don't th it will be rolling a lot . 
UNKNOWN Yeah but I li I like your idea that we shouldn't have a lot of buttons b buttons so Uh do you want a an L_C_D_ with twenty five Euros ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah and you you you will not have pla enough a lot of place to put a L_C_D_ on a banana also . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well , you're the Marketing Expert you should tell us if it is too much or not . 
UNKNOWN Well , this is Okay . 
UNKNOWN I think Well , according to the to the reportpeople are more interested in in a fa fancy look and feel and in a technological inno in innovation , so , I will give more importance to the look and feel than rather than the new inputs and also it's I'm not convinced about this L_C_D_ because you need uh internet connection , you need more things , it's not just buying a new control re remote , you need buying control remote , buying uh more things . 
UNKNOWN So So you you you suggest to go f Okay . 
UNKNOWN S so you're simply you're simply looking s to a remote control that looks like a banana with few buttons with only a few buttons . 
UNKNOWN It's not so simple . 
UNKNOWN For instance , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah for for for given an an example yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay good . 
UNKNOWN So maybe you can go ahead ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah no , it's what I already said . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Thanks . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Okay , I'll give the floor . 
UNKNOWN So you are User Interface guy . 
UNKNOWN So you're three ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And it's this one . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN Go for it . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So . 
UNKNOWN S next uh slide. 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So I received an emailum around lunchtime letting me know that the brilliant minds at our technology division had developed an integrated programmable sample sensor sample speaker unit , um which is a way for you to have a conversation with your coffee machine and or remote control . 
UNKNOWN But it's just a speaker right ? 
UNKNOWN It's no , what it is , it's it's very It has a has a microphone , has a speaker , it's got a little chip and it allows you t Well , it's a sample sensor sample speaker . 
UNKNOWN It's not a microphone . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Actually I'm not reading microphone there , so that's why you can all have conversation , it just to speak to you . 
UNKNOWN Sample sensor sample speaker . 
UNKNOWN It means that it can recognize , it can do like a match on a on a certain phrase that you speak and then can play back a phrase in response to that . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm , mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN But uh there's no kind of um understanding of the phrase . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So , I mean , you know , I guess you could build that in , you could you could link the the recognition of a certain phrase to some function on on the remote control . 
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm , mm-hmm , mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN But basically the thing is , we have this technology available in-house . 
UNKNOWN In-house . 
UNKNOWN So , um but the thing is obviously there's still gonna be a cost if you decided to integrate that because you still have to pay for the c production of the components , so um it it but it basically means we c we can kind of consider this from uh you know uh a theoretical or usability kind of viewpoint without worrying too much about you know how to develop it because we have this already done . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm , mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm , mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Whilst you know , some people might get annoyed if we uh if we just dump it , It's it it's no , well , it's it'll recognize uh I guess keywords , but you know keywords in a certain order like a phrase . 
UNKNOWN I there's something that I unclear really understanding . 
UNKNOWN Is this a technology that recognize keywords speech keywords ? 
UNKNOWN You train it for a certain uh , for a certain phrase , you say the the example they said that they have uh up and running with their prototype is um well they've actually integrated into the into the the coffee machine that uh that we're producing is , you can say good morning to the coffee machine and it can recognize that phrase and it'll playback good morning , how would you like your coffee ? 
UNKNOWN And it's just to , it's just to playback something ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So actually that was a bad example , 'cause it doesn't actually ask how do you want your coffee because it can't really understand the response , so . 
UNKNOWN Yeah yeah . 
UNKNOWN So this is not s really to do to to do control . 
UNKNOWN Only , like , only in the sense that it it can recognize a set a set target kind of word an It's designed it's designed as a fun kind of thing , but I guess you could use it as uh as a way to implement uh Completely pointless yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN This is just more like a poi pois yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah yeah . 
UNKNOWN So it it's c uh it it it is a uh uh easy uh a fancy thing that you you can bring to we can bring to the remote control that will not have any uh yeah comp completely pointless for the inter for from the interaction point of v point of view . 
UNKNOWN Yeah but you can u Yeah but the can we use it for saying okay , channel fifty , channel twenty ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , unless you know , you like having conversation with your remote control . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Well yeah , that's the thing , if you can but you have to pro though I think it's a fairly simple design so you would have to record into the device every possible combination , you have to s tr train it to l to learn channel fifteen , that whole thing , not just the word channel and the word fifteen , it doesn't have that kind of logic in it . 
UNKNOWN Yeah yeah . 
UNKNOWN So this is so this is this is much more than tak taking this technology , bringing it to the remote control and using it . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So Yeah , that would be some development work . 
UNKNOWN So this is out of discussion . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So if if if it is something that you can we can bring easily and to put it into the banana remote control No this is mm banana-bando , yeah . 
UNKNOWN M Mando . 
UNKNOWN Banana-mando . 
UNKNOWN Banana-mando yeah . 
UNKNOWN Banana-man I uh I I I don't think it's worth it though , I think it doesn't really add much to the functional design and it's it's it's not mature enough to use as a speech recognition engine , so Um , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh then it could be cool yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah okay , let's go ahead . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So if we can just move on to the next slide, I've just done a quick mock-up of uh uh some of the features of our potential funky-looking uh remote control Well , you see , I was I was unaware at this point of th of the fruit focus , um , so at the moment it's more of a box focus . 
UNKNOWN It doesn't look like a banana at all . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But you you can fit i you're saying now you can fit it to Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Looks like a tr look likes a a tro a tropical fruit . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , well , this is actu this could be a genetically engineered fruit that's designed to be you know square so that it packs tighter in the boxes . 
UNKNOWN But um , I've just indicated here , we could have actually two scroll wheels , 'cause I think the scroll wheel is a fairly um key part of , you know , I think everyone has has agreed that it's that it could be quite a useful um thing , so . 
UNKNOWN Stable thing , that's right . 
UNKNOWN To have , mm-hmm , mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN But I think it's important , you know , to have two scroll wheels because , you know , you want one for for the channel , but you also want one for for the volume , because it's it's the volume i it's , you know it's very handy for it to have uh instant kind of uh feedback uh and response , so . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm , mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN But um , I've also included this turbo button because I think , you know , every design should have a turbo button , and well so this is you know , a unique problem with with televisions is that if you have this scro this scroll wheel for the television , the uh the tuner on the T_V_ is not gonna be able to to switch between stations as fast as you can scroll , so you know , the th the person might want to have a uh Might want to be able to scroll past television stations without seeing what's on them , in which case it just waits until you stop scrolling and then , you know , displays that station . 
UNKNOWN What's a turbo button ? 
UNKNOWN Or they might want to scroll and and have a quick glimpse of it , even if it lags behind what they're doing . 
UNKNOWN It con it controls the speed ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , so with this turbo button you can , say , skip over t channels if uh , you know , if I'm if I'm going if I'm scrolling past them and you know , it's um , you could have a little red light that comes up when they press it so they feel you know it's really going fast or whatever . 
UNKNOWN So yeah , that's um , those are the two important uh features I think we need on the remote , but I mean we can discuss about what other kind of buttons we need , um . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN You know , i it could be , you know , if we if we wanna have like a very cheap kind of device , I mean , we could either consider that maybe we want to sell this as a very , if it's gonna be a banana , you know that's a pretty gimmicky kind of thing that doesn't have that much functionality , it's just you know a couple of scroll wheels and a button cause it's hard to get so many buttons on a banana and it's still very it may even be for most for some people more functional than their current remote , but if they have these scroll wheels , so , um you know , what other buttons do we want ? 
UNKNOWN It's enough . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN I mean we could have well , I guess you need an on and off switch , but you could you could o you could turn it turn it on by taking the top off the banana maybe , you know , it's kind of like a spy kind of flick thing . 
UNKNOWN Switch on . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So sounds crazy . 
UNKNOWN I like crazy ideas . 
UNKNOWN That's why you're a marketing guru . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , of course . 
UNKNOWN So i it looks like we're going completely to forget about the L_C_D_ thing . 
UNKNOWN Well , that's the thing , as have we decided that we can only spend , uh , twenty five Euro ? 
UNKNOWN I think that No we can we can't use that . 
UNKNOWN Well not spend , but you know , charge twenty five Euro . 
UNKNOWN I I think we could use somehow the s coffee machine dialogue interface or so . 
UNKNOWN You we can ? 
UNKNOWN We can't use that to to comman co communicate , it's just a thing No . 
UNKNOWN We can't . 
UNKNOWN Communicate . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but we can say channel twenty five . 
UNKNOWN It's one way . 
UNKNOWN No ? 
UNKNOWN But then you have to have a template for every channel , for a hundred channels , you have to be able to to recognize Mm . 
UNKNOWN It's not a lot one hundred templates , it's not Ah , it's designed for a cof okay . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Well , I f I think it's probably more than , than our can handle because it's designed for a coffee machine , you know , to say hello in the morning . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Is it design for a coffee machine ? 
UNKNOWN Well that's its current application , I would presume that it's kind of , they wouldn't design it to handle a hundred things th so . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Maybe you could ask your the you could ask the engineering department if we can Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN A good good good thing . 
UNKNOWN But uh Well I just I just made the point , I don't I don't know if that speech recognition is , you know , even if we can do it , I think it's not really appropriate for uh television environment . 
UNKNOWN You want to g to move to your slides? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's right , yeah . 
UNKNOWN You're finished ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah I think so . 
UNKNOWN But um I did have one thing from a previous meeting , you were talking about um being able to find the remote control and I was talking about extendin being able to extend the remote control by having you know , a base station that can control other things as well . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN It might be useful to have some kind of base station , even if it's just you press on a button on it and uh and the remote control starts beeping , you know , this is a way of finding the remote . 
UNKNOWN Y in that case maybe the maybe the speech recognition the speech thing could be useful just to say I'm here but uh it's probably a bit of overkill if you could just have a a beeping It's speech It's it's speech synthesis and s it's speech kind of , not really speech recognition , but kind of pattern matching , yeah yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Exactly yeah . 
UNKNOWN So it's a speech synthesis kind of thing , something has been uh stored and it's just uh spoken out . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN That's right . 
UNKNOWN Oh , good idea . 
CONFIRMATION Very good . 
UNKNOWN Okay , let's move on . 
UNKNOWN So you're two ? 
UNKNOWN That's right . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So this is going to be about the component design . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So first thing is we need power source for the remote control . 
UNKNOWN So I was of the idea that we can have two kind of power supplies , one is the usual batteries which are there , they could be chargeable batteries if there's a basis station kind of thing and on top of that we can have solar cells , when the lighting conditions are good they can be used so it'll be pretty uh innovative kind . 
UNKNOWN Then uh we need plastic with some elasticity so that if your if the remote control falls it's not broken directly into pieces , there should be some flexibility in t Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I guess that fits in with the spongy kind of design philosophy . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So there should we should think of something like that and then it should be double curve . 
UNKNOWN The s science for the ease of handling and there are some other issues why we need double curve . 
UNKNOWN Then controls for the traditionals u traditional users we can have the push buttons so that they don't feel that it's an alien thing for them . 
UNKNOWN So , just one second , when you say double curve , what do you actually mean ? 
UNKNOWN You reckon you could like drawus a thing on the , on the whiteboard 'cause I'm not sure Okay , but like , kind of convex or concave ? 
UNKNOWN Double curve is , you have curves on both the sides if I'm right . 
UNKNOWN So it's symmetrical kind of thing , whatever it is . 
UNKNOWN So , it could be curve , so it could be convex , conve concave , depending on what what we want . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So there are flats , there are single curve and there are double curves . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN These are the three things , and there are different materials , with plastic you can have double curve but with uh certain other materials we cannot have double curve . 
UNKNOWN So there there was uh there were many other materials like wood , titanium and all those things , but plastic is I think is the most appropriate one , it'll bring the cost down and anyway it's Wooden cases Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Although , you know , wood could be uh quite a stylish uh option , if you take like , nice quality kind of wood that's got a nice grain and you kind of put some , some varnish on . 
UNKNOWN Mm but i but there is no elasticity which could be Yeah but the components inside . 
UNKNOWN Well it depends , I mean , you have the outs the wood itself is not gonna break so you don't have to worry too much about the case being broken , it's the inside . 
UNKNOWN Yeah but inside you know you could have you can still have some kind of cushioning that's not visible to the to the user . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Very too expensive to do . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And I mean you could also , you can have just a very thin veneer of wood as well . 
UNKNOWN And also uh Yeah but it's more easier to do a banana in plastic than uh in wood . 
UNKNOWN That's true , but are we set on the banana idea ? 
UNKNOWN Actually I was thinking that the the shape of a banana is not it's not really handy . 
UNKNOWN Well it look like it looks like you are all targeting that yeah ? 
UNKNOWN Yes it is . 
UNKNOWN Uh I don't know the name o o in English uh This it's not a fruit it's a vegetable . 
UNKNOWN Is it an e apple which has Banana is more handier as compared to this I think , and to capsicum . 
UNKNOWN It's like a pumpkin or Green . 
UNKNOWN Yeah ? 
UNKNOWN Pumpkin . 
UNKNOWN Green . 
UNKNOWN Green . 
UNKNOWN Um um um , yes I see . 
UNKNOWN What does it taste like ? 
UNKNOWN And you put in the salad . 
UNKNOWN Pep pepperoni . 
UNKNOWN Um Oui c'est ca Pepper . 
UNKNOWN Ah yeah , is it what's it in French ? 
UNKNOWN Poivron . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , okay , so capsicum or pepper . 
UNKNOWN Uh pepper . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But um they do d Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And it's al it also suits with the double curve for easy of No , I mean in a I'm sure it's fun . 
UNKNOWN I don't know , it seems a little bit kind of bulky to me , like like with a banana you can have Well But like a banana you can you can be holding like this and have the scroll wheel kind of on top and just roll it back and forth like that , but with uh I don't know how you would hold a capsicum and So is that , when you say speaker support , you mean it just has some output pinned which which which kind of Okay , but the speaker is actually attached to the to the chip in some way , or is just the the signal ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It's not re it you you think it's really fancy and fun ? 
UNKNOWN You think that young people that are Yeah . 
UNKNOWN More than a banana ? 
UNKNOWN But banana is not so handy , I think that's handier . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It's kind it's kind of it's more uh it's really ergonomic , it's fit in the hand and you've a lot of surface to to put the controls . 
UNKNOWN Okay let's move on . 
UNKNOWN Yeah you're right . 
UNKNOWN So time is running , let's move on . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so push buttons for the traditional users so that they don't feel they are alienated , just and a scroll button with push technology for channel selection , volume control and teletext browsing . 
UNKNOWN These are the three scroll buttons which are already available with us in the company and we we can go ahead with that . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , we can go to the next slide. 
UNKNOWN Then uh there are different kind of chips , one one is the basic chip and the regular chip and one an adva advanced chip . 
UNKNOWN So we can have regular chip for control . 
UNKNOWN Pricing is a factor for us , that's why we'll go for the regular chip . 
UNKNOWN And uh regular chip supports speaker support , so this functionality could be used for tracing the mobile phone which has been misplaced . 
UNKNOWN It could be a beep kind of thing . 
UNKNOWN Yes , yes , that's right , it's it's onto the chip , most most probably , not not hundred per cent sure about that . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So are there any issues where we place this this chip to make sure you can actually hear the the speaker from the outside of the banana ? 
UNKNOWN That will be the volume control I think which which a user shou it it should be already pre-defined . 
UNKNOWN It should be whatever will be the case , the chip is always going to be sitting inside . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but the speaker , if the speaker is actually on the chip , then if it's too far away from the the casing , or if the casing is too thick , then you may not hear the the speaker . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Uh , so we can have it at one of the boundaries so that things are slightly better . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN As or as hearing is concerned , we can have some gap at some place , so that That's right . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So that's something we have to keep in mind with the actual physical design is to keep the the speaker close enough to the outside . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So these these were the component selection and these things . 
UNKNOWN We can go to the next slide. 
UNKNOWN And uh these were the findings which I I saw with the web web , that user wants to have control more than one device wants to control more than one device from the same remote control , so our T_V_ remote can have little extra things to support additional devices like V_C_R_ D_V_D_ players which are usually attached with the T_V_ , because users are like this and they don't want to have one remote control for everything , so with this additional little , we might be having slightly better market for us . 
UNKNOWN Although , if It depends , if we like , if we are concentrating on like a fruit design , then maybe maybe we wanna sell a collection of fruit , you know , like a different fruit for each device . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Of fruits . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Cause that , you know , that sometimes people like to collect um you know things that of a similar type . 
UNKNOWN Remotes objects , okay . 
UNKNOWN S objects . 
UNKNOWN Crazy objects . 
UNKNOWN I think that would be funny at the beginning but after one month you will be tired of be surrounded of fruits . 
UNKNOWN Well , you're the one who wanted to do fruit in the first place . 
UNKNOWN No but I think just one fruit to control everything . 
UNKNOWN Like a power fruit . 
UNKNOWN A power fr a power M a Mando , a Supermando fruit . 
UNKNOWN And uh as well as I could see on the web the scroll button is becoming really uh hot thing s and we should have it on the remote . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Actually I I didn't understand very well this trace speaker lost control . 
UNKNOWN Well I think that's a pretty handy feature . 
UNKNOWN Okay , good . 
UNKNOWN So you're having a basis station . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Your usually your remote sits on that . 
UNKNOWN So you and it's that's why it can have chargeable batteries . 
UNKNOWN Now let's say Basis station is with the thing . 
UNKNOWN So you you have to buy two things , the banana and the basis station . 
UNKNOWN Bu it's it's . 
UNKNOWN You s you you thing . 
UNKNOWN It's like a telephone handset is there and the basis station for the telephone hand set is there . 
UNKNOWN So now what user gets additionally he doesn't have to buy batteries , they're rechargeable batteries , so over the period of cor time he'll recover the cost . 
UNKNOWN So you're having the basis station and there is a button , if you press that button wherever the remote it'll start beeping so you know where the remote is . 
UNKNOWN Uh Mm-hmm , mm-hmm , mm-hmm , mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think it's kind of people would find that worth it even if it wasn't uh a recharging station , even if they didn't have to buy extra batteries , you know . 
UNKNOWN Yeah but I'm a bit worried about the budget . 
UNKNOWN So Although you do need to include R_F_ kind of circuitry in the remote . 
UNKNOWN Uh this is basis station is nothing more , just it's a wire which is coming from the main cable and uh you're having one socket on which the thing sits . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN That's right . 
UNKNOWN But all these things are usually in-house so we don't have much problems . 
UNKNOWN So component cost is going to be the least . 
UNKNOWN Anyway , we are not using really advanced technology , L_C_D_ has already been ruled out , A_S_R_ has been ruled out . 
UNKNOWN So it's the basic thing but very trendy and very user-friendly . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN And Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN I'm just wondering actually , 'cause , you know , I this whole fruit thing with the banana , it's um it seemed like it first seems a bit kind of uh niche , like only a few people would really want a banana , but what if it was kind of uh a stylised banana ? 
UNKNOWN You know , rather than having it kind of you know yellow and really looking exactly like a banana , you could make it kind of silver . 
UNKNOWN And um , you know to give you kind of the idea of a banana but without it looking you know completely kitsch . 
UNKNOWN For better want of a better word you know ? 
UNKNOWN You think that yellow it's kitsch . 
UNKNOWN Well , you know , I don I don't know how many peop Well they Yeah , like this colour this colour Maybe , you know , maybe like still in the shape of a banana . 
UNKNOWN If you make something that looks like a banana it should have the colour of a banana . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN No , I I Maybe li like that . 
UNKNOWN A yeah , otherwise it'll be mis means you don't get b any feeling then . 
UNKNOWN O otherwise Roughly . 
UNKNOWN It's neither a banana nor a And uh going to the last slide. 
UNKNOWN No , exactly . 
UNKNOWN Exactly . 
UNKNOWN Um , but you know , just maybe maybe not exactly the same texture as a banana and just kind of , you know because the thing is it's gonna be a little bit difficult to make um to give like the texture of a banana anyway and to k to have the exact shape . 
UNKNOWN I think if you're gonna not be able to do it properly you may as well do it in a stylised way that just looks a bit more kind of , you know , twenty first century rather than sixties or seventies . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Let's move on . 
UNKNOWN Uh uh yeah . 
UNKNOWN Before before st before ending the meeting I'd like to to drawsome sketchabout the pro future prot prototype . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Go for it . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Well no , not not you , you can finish your slidesbefore Mm okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so . 
UNKNOWN Anyway , users'll be so the findings is users'll be very interested in our locator device to find their misplaced remotes . 
UNKNOWN So that was very I thought it's a very good suggestion by everybody . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN That's it . 
UNKNOWN That's all ? 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so mm so well done for the presentations. 
UNKNOWN So we need to take some de decisions about um about what we're going to do . 
UNKNOWN So I I propose that you go to the whiteboard and we're going to reportall the ideas we had we had during this these presentationsjust to drawsome sketchabout what will be the prod final product and uh where Superman go banana and uh uh extra func functionalities such as wheels , um the speaker unit um well not in order not to lost the um the device , I do I don't remember you call it ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN That's right . 
UNKNOWN The basis station . 
UNKNOWN Basis station , yeah . 
UNKNOWN That's right . 
UNKNOWN Uh so um so we're going for a stylish banana shape . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , so , I guess you wanna hold like the way the end of the banana you wanna kind of hold as ma you maybe wanna kinda hold like a gun rather than 'cause you don't want it to point kind of towards the floor . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , right . 
UNKNOWN So you know , so if you have like Okay , so So okay , so I guess we need , you know , something that can fit a banana shaped object . 
UNKNOWN What about what about this shape ? 
UNKNOWN More or less . 
UNKNOWN We I if it i if it has really the model shape of a bana you could the the starting is good but it could it should have more the shape of a banana if you want to point really a at the thing . 
UNKNOWN There's less space on this to put with the buttons . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but how many buttons do we need ? 
UNKNOWN If you don't want to to to do that movement which is which is difficult if you don't have to do it in fact , it's better . 
UNKNOWN Uh what about a The base station . 
UNKNOWN So ti time is running , we have to we have to we have to to move forward . 
UNKNOWN So let's skip to uh this uh this this this idea . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So we have this . 
UNKNOWN We have a a basis um , how do you call it ? 
UNKNOWN A base station . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN We'll have a base station extra uh on the side . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh , we have a R_F_ for um for beeping for beeping . 
UNKNOWN That's right , yeah , we need that , yeah . 
UNKNOWN We need b R_F_ to beep . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so it's uh Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So we that means we need a button on th on the on the basis . 
UNKNOWN Basis station . 
UNKNOWN Basis station , thank you . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Alright , so we need uh okay . 
UNKNOWN Can you go quickly please ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So we are going to add uh also um you as you suggested the whee some wheels to control the volumes and channels and your tur turbo turbo uh button . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , which I think it's it's probably best actually on the on the underneath of the the device , so you have Yes . 
UNKNOWN Turbo button . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , on the th yeah , maybe here . 
UNKNOWN And the and the wheel a a at the level of the thumb for instance . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , so you have the thumb kind of here . 
UNKNOWN And and you have two wheels . 
UNKNOWN So yeah , you need one one here and one on on the other side , so you got volume an and channel . 
UNKNOWN Okay right . 
UNKNOWN Good . 
UNKNOWN And , uh No L_C_D_ . 
UNKNOWN So no L_C_D_ . 
UNKNOWN Okay great . 
CONFUSION Um . 
CONFIRMATION Very good . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Oh we need a we need a power um on off switch as well . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh for the remote ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Oh , just the switch , no f not for the T_V_ for the T_V_ . 
UNKNOWN Remotes don't have power on off switch . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh so you On the side . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN S no , that'll be controlled by the those buttons'll be there already , yeah . 
UNKNOWN What a What about Four millions ? 
UNKNOWN Where ? 
UNKNOWN Means on the remote . 
UNKNOWN Because remote is going to have both the interfaces , scroll as well as buttons . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN They are not going to cost you much , everything is in-house and now you don't want the traditional users to be apprehensive of this . 
UNKNOWN Well , I dunno if the traditional user is gonna buy a a banana remote in the first place , you know . 
UNKNOWN Oh , yeah . 
UNKNOWN That's that's another issue which I didn't think of . 
UNKNOWN Y I mean you need to kind of keep it um Yeah , how many of these did we wanna sell ? 
UNKNOWN But you know our targets are very high , means fifty million Euros is the profit which we want make . 
UNKNOWN I can't remember , what was Yeah , but how many units did we need to to sell ? 
UNKNOWN Twenty five . 
UNKNOWN Twelve point five is the profit on one . 
UNKNOWN Twenty five . 
UNKNOWN Uh forty th four . 
UNKNOWN Point point four million ? 
UNKNOWN Four point four million . 
UNKNOWN Point four million . 
UNKNOWN That's a lot of fruit . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN In the market . 
UNKNOWN What about a I wo what about adding the this word spotting , keyword spotting recognition saying volume up volume down ? 
UNKNOWN So . 
UNKNOWN Well . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN Time is running , we have to close the meeting in a few minutes . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So , okay , the next step , you can come back to your seat . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN The next step is to go for to f is to go to uh to building a prototype , based on this , okay ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So next meeting you guys have to prepare the followi things . 
UNKNOWN You have to uh work on the look and feel uh design and you have to work on the user interface , in fact you two you have to work together to model the first uh f first prototype . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Uh Marketing Expert uh have to go to product evaluation . 
UNKNOWN Okay ? 
UNKNOWN It's too difficult . 
UNKNOWN It's too difficult but people like innovation and that's really uh innovative and I don't know if it would cost a lot , just a few five words . 
UNKNOWN It's not a possi it will not be possible to implement it for the next prototype , so t it's in the next prototype so let's skip it . 
CONFUSION Uh . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN For the future prototypes . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , maybe , for the n if if if it it works well , we'll go for uh an orange one . 
UNKNOWN That can be the t That can be like the turbo banana plus plus commando . 
UNKNOWN Yeah yeah , honour the fruit . 
UNKNOWN Plus plus , okay . 
UNKNOWN Maybe objective banana ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Thanks very much . 
UNKNOWN We'll see n next meeting . 
FAREWELL Bye . 
UNKNOWN So meeting's over ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN We have to go design the prototype . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
THANKS Thank you . 
THANKS Thank you . 
THANKS Thank you . 
UNKNOWN The problem is after all this meeting there is Okay , . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Good afternoon again . 
UNKNOWN So we should have our final meeting about the detail designed of detail design of the product of the remote control . 
UNKNOWN Um So here is the agendafor today . 
UNKNOWN Uh uh just going to go quickly through the minutesof the last last uh meeting then we have a p presentationof prototype of you two , sounds interesting . 
UNKNOWN And we'll have um presentationof evaluation crit criteria by ou our Marketing Experts . 
UNKNOWN Then we'll have to go through finance evaluation of the of the cost of the thing and um hopefully uh we should fit the target o tw of twelve point five uh uh Euro . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So let's go . 
UNKNOWN Uh if I go quickly through the minutesof the last meeting . 
UNKNOWN So we went through th uh w we took this following decisions . 
UNKNOWN No L_C_D_ , no speech recognition technology , okay , we went through a b to a banana look and feel for the remote control . 
UNKNOWN We went through the use of wheels and but buttons . 
UNKNOWN And also the use of a basis station for battery ch charging and uh also to um call the to call the mot mote remote control when it is lost . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Good . 
UNKNOWN So guys let this uh wonderful thing . 
UNKNOWN Okay so we can go to the slides. 
UNKNOWN Oh yeah . 
UNKNOWN Sorry . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Number three . 
UNKNOWN Oh number two sorry . 
UNKNOWN Which is Yeah can you show it to the the camera maybe . 
UNKNOWN So final design . 
UNKNOWN Final design . 
UNKNOWN Okay so Michael you can go ahead . 
UNKNOWN Yeah so uh following our decision to uh make a yellow well to make a banana remote okay so we actually have a We've well first first of all we made a an attractive base station uh with a banana leaf uh look and feel um and uh bana sit the banana sits in there k you know nicely weighted so that it's not gonna tip over and um this is the remote itself , it's kind of it's it's ergonomic , it fits in the hand uh rather well . 
UNKNOWN You can pull it out first , maybe . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN We've got the two uh uh scroll wheels here which you know one on the the left for the uh volume and the one on the right for for the channel and uh underneath we have the uh the turbo button which is in like a nice uh trigger position for you know for pressing quite naturally . 
UNKNOWN What's the use uh of the t turbo button already ? 
UNKNOWN This is when you when you uh are scrolling the uh through the channels you can tell it to to skip th past channels that you quickly rather th Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Ah yeah yeah an then you stop when you stop it stops . 
UNKNOWN Well when you stop scrolling the wheel it stops . 
UNKNOWN But normally with uh it will just uh s stay on each station briefly so you can see the the picture . 
UNKNOWN Uh And we we do have one more functionality . 
UNKNOWN Uh-huh . 
UNKNOWN If you take the banana as such and uh you press the turbo button , so it switch ons the switch ons the T_V_ . 
UNKNOWN The T_V_ yeah . 
UNKNOWN Which one ? 
UNKNOWN The s the turbo button . 
UNKNOWN The turbo button . 
UNKNOWN So rather than having uh an extra button for um for the on off switch you just use the turbo button . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Additional button . 
UNKNOWN What this button for ? 
UNKNOWN This is a teletext button . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So once you press that then you get teletext and you can use the the channel selector scroll wheel as uh To navigate yeah . 
UNKNOWN To navigate it through th through teletext . 
UNKNOWN But if you want to go to pageseven hundred ? 
UNKNOWN That's right , that's right . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN with the wheel it's easy . 
UNKNOWN How man I don't understand it . 
UNKNOWN Well then you can you you have like a little uh number selection thing , you press the the the teletext button uh to move between uh the fields and then you can just scroll the number back and forth so you have s you go you scroll to seven and then zero zero and then you can uh Well you can you can press press the teletext button and then you then you can you can f Mm uh And this is the uh the infrared uh port . 
UNKNOWN Can you repeat it ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So then then both the scroll buttons they are for teletext browsing . 
UNKNOWN And you can tele yeah , once you press the teletext button then the scroll buttons they are more for teletext , they are no more for channel or vol volume . 
UNKNOWN Ah okay okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Okay okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN I see . 
UNKNOWN I see . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN That's right . 
UNKNOWN Also the top of the banana . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Excellent . 
UNKNOWN So . 
UNKNOWN And then we have in the uh in the base station we have the the button at the front for uh for calling the uh the banana . 
UNKNOWN Calling . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Excellent . 
UNKNOWN And the the leaves plays the roles of of antennas ? 
UNKNOWN Actually they do . 
UNKNOWN That's that's yeah that's uh that's form and function in the one in the one uh object . 
SURPRISE Oh .
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So it always means , whatever the rays goes by they they get reflected and then you are having a better coverage . 
UNKNOWN It's like antennas . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So . 
UNKNOWN But yeah that's um that's just like that's an attractive um base station . 
CONFIRMATION Great . 
UNKNOWN So . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So , what else ? 
UNKNOWN And for the power source we are having solar cells and rechargeable batteries and this and uh the basis station is going to have the input from the mm power line for for charging the batteries . 
UNKNOWN Is it really weight ? 
UNKNOWN Is it light or Okay . 
UNKNOWN It is very light . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , they're light . 
UNKNOWN It's it's uh it's about the weight of a banana . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN You know , to give you the correct look and feel . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Ok Okay . 
UNKNOWN And we have put these different colours so that people don't mistake them mistake it as a banana . 
UNKNOWN Otherwise it's you know a child comes and so Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah yeah yeah , I see . 
UNKNOWN I under I understand . 
UNKNOWN I think a child would try to eat it anyway , so maybe we should consider that . 
UNKNOWN maybe health and safety aspects . 
UNKNOWN Ah yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Oh we didn't think of that yet . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So for the power source , apparently you still you you want to use both solar cells and batteries . 
UNKNOWN Oh yeah that's right . 
UNKNOWN Uh you mean okay . 
UNKNOWN I don't really know if the solar cells are actually necessary any more if you have a recharging base station . 
UNKNOWN So Yeah , where are going to where are you are you going to place them ? 
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN It'll It'll be always at top somewhere at there . 
UNKNOWN If I was gonna place them I'd put them on the on the top here since that's like uh the black bit but yeah I don't I really don't think it's necessary to have the solar cells anymore . 
UNKNOWN You have enough surface ? 
UNKNOWN You Okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah because now we are having rechargeable batteries so that that is . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN What will be the autonomy ? 
UNKNOWN Roughly ? 
UNKNOWN The what sorry ? 
UNKNOWN The autonomy . 
UNKNOWN Autonomy . 
UNKNOWN What do you mean ? 
UNKNOWN Uh I mean how long does i how how how long can it be held off a station ? 
UNKNOWN How long the how long the bit the batteries long . 
UNKNOWN Ah . 
UNKNOWN Ah . 
UNKNOWN A long time . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Eight to ten eight to ten hours . 
UNKNOWN A long Yeah , so it's It's used only when you Yeah . 
UNKNOWN No no no , it can it should be weeks . 
UNKNOWN N most no most of the time it's not being used . 
UNKNOWN Yeah but y people don't like to put it back in the base station all the time people leave wanna leave it on the couch so Ah , okay . 
UNKNOWN So when when you are making it on Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN No eight or eight or ten hours of working . 
UNKNOWN If you are just leaving like that it'll be much longer . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN F weeks . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN That's right . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Next slide? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And we are having the speakers regular chip for control . 
UNKNOWN Pricing is was a factor so that's why we have gone for a regular chip only not the advanced chip . 
UNKNOWN And uh that's it . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Those really sounds very good . 
UNKNOWN That's right . 
UNKNOWN Nothing else to add ? 
UNKNOWN It seems to be falling over . 
UNKNOWN I l yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I like I like it . 
UNKNOWN Maybe the the thing that convince me the less is the the multifunctional buttons . 
UNKNOWN Looks a bit Looks a bit puzzled uh I dunno how to say that . 
UNKNOWN You want to have more functional buttons ? 
UNKNOWN You the the b the buttons change h h their function depending if y it's teletext or not And the volume button will will become And what about people who want to use digits ? 
UNKNOWN You are not convinced . 
UNKNOWN Not not many , we we want to keep it simple . 
UNKNOWN So that this button fo is for teletext which is usually also the case , that usually there is a teletext button and once you press that , the channel buttons , they baco become the scrolling buttons . 
UNKNOWN It's up to you , means . 
UNKNOWN Now that Means let's say this this can move the the larger digits and this can move the smaller digits . 
UNKNOWN Well in fact b both will be could be useful , navigating through teletext . 
UNKNOWN Or can move between positions in the in the number . 
UNKNOWN That's right . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Butto real buttons ? 
UNKNOWN Wow . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So there was there was a constraint that the surface area which we have on this banana on one side because of the shape . 
UNKNOWN So we are targeting a segment which is which is just very trendy kind of thing , they they don't care about the buttons any more . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN And anyway Evalua yeah . 
UNKNOWN Because have you thought about configuration and all this kind of uh stuff ? 
UNKNOWN It's all automatic . 
UNKNOWN It's all automatic . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Okay yeah it's fine . 
UNKNOWN Very good uh yeah you th yeah . 
UNKNOWN W we are living in a wonderful world . 
CONFUSION Uh . 
UNKNOWN Bananas everywhere . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so So we have to go through now evaluations . 
UNKNOWN Automatically configure . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So your slidesare ready ? 
UNKNOWN S Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh you're four I think . 
UNKNOWN So this is one , which one is this one ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN I I const I constructed a a list of criteria based on the on the general user requirements . 
UNKNOWN And each criteria is will be evaluated it's uh logical criteria so we must users must say i if it's true or is or if it's false in a in a scale ranging from zero to seven . 
UNKNOWN Why this strange factor of seven ? 
UNKNOWN Because i I'm sorry . 
UNKNOWN Sorry . 
UNKNOWN Usually I have seen that scales are from one to ten . 
UNKNOWN Ah yeah . 
UNKNOWN It's from sorry , it's from one to seven . 
UNKNOWN It's from from one to seven sorry . 
UNKNOWN Because it should be an even it should be an even uh scale , and five is too short and nine is too long . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Num number So to have in order to have enough granularity it's in order to have enough granularity in the evaluation . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Okay fine , got the idea . 
UNKNOWN I'm a I I'm Sorry ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN The variance is mi it's is minimal . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Okay , okay , great . 
UNKNOWN I'm um answering your question . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah yeah . 
UNKNOWN Go ahead . 
UNKNOWN And that's the criteria I I found more useful . 
UNKNOWN I think I sh I I could write the criteria in the on the whiteboard ? 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Sure . 
UNKNOWN And we all four could range could evaluate the Okay let's let's evaluate if it's fancy or Seven but I would say seven . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So you can say fancy , handy . 
UNKNOWN Handy . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , it's fancy , according to me . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , six . 
UNKNOWN Seven . 
UNKNOWN S seven . 
UNKNOWN Seven by me . 
UNKNOWN Six . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN It's quite fancy . 
UNKNOWN So you can add seven plus six plus seven plus Five . 
UNKNOWN No , wait . 
UNKNOWN Yeah uh five . 
UNKNOWN What do you say seven ? 
UNKNOWN Five ? 
UNKNOWN Five , maybe maybe maybe six it's it's I guess it's yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay , six point five . 
UNKNOWN Handy ? 
UNKNOWN Again I'll give seven . 
UNKNOWN Seven . 
UNKNOWN I'd give it a six like I'd I think it's probably more handy than my current remote , 'cause of the scroll wheels but maybe loses the point for not having you know the extra buttons when you reall if you do need them for some reason but you know you can always use your other remote . 
UNKNOWN Six . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN So seven , seven , six , six point five . 
UNKNOWN Seven for me . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Six . 
UNKNOWN Functional . 
UNKNOWN I'll give five . 
UNKNOWN Four . 
UNKNOWN I would say Everything ar Mm everything It's compared to the all remote controls . 
UNKNOWN Well it depends when you say functional , do you mean it does what we want it to do , or d does what it does , you know , can it make you coffee ? 
UNKNOWN You know . 
UNKNOWN Uh for a remote control , does he have all the you could expect . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN That's right . 
UNKNOWN That's right . 
UNKNOWN That's before Yeah . 
UNKNOWN The standards . 
UNKNOWN What is available in the market off the shelf . 
UNKNOWN I have to say four . 
UNKNOWN Actually I don't know what are the r the real specification of a of a universal remote contro Ah it's not an univer but it's for all kind of T_V_s ? 
UNKNOWN Well it's not a universal remote . 
UNKNOWN Remember we're focus we're supposed to focus just on T_V_s . 
UNKNOWN We Five . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well all T_V_s but only T_ only T_V_s I guess . 
UNKNOWN So it's universal but for T_V_s . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So s uh four ? 
UNKNOWN Five ? 
UNKNOWN Four . 
UNKNOWN Four . 
UNKNOWN Four . 
UNKNOWN Four . 
UNKNOWN So four point two ? 
UNKNOWN Just four . 
UNKNOWN Four . 
UNKNOWN four . 
UNKNOWN So four ? 
UNKNOWN Obviously there are some outliers so Which I'll say five . 
UNKNOWN Okay cool ? 
UNKNOWN Cool device . 
UNKNOWN There I'll give it seven . 
UNKNOWN It means cool features , like new features actually . 
UNKNOWN That's right . 
UNKNOWN For a T_V_ the most important feature which I felt was the locator which is a cool feature . 
UNKNOWN And then the scroll buttons are again cool features . 
UNKNOWN We don't have L_C_D_ for it but that we decided we don't want to have . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Seven . 
UNKNOWN I would say five . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Six . 
UNKNOWN Seven . 
UNKNOWN Plus six , I say I said seven . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So it's six . 
UNKNOWN S yeah . 
UNKNOWN You said seven ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause it's five five seven seven so Uh , okay , definitely easy to use . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Definitely seven . 
UNKNOWN Seven . 
UNKNOWN Seven . 
UNKNOWN Seven . 
UNKNOWN And you ? 
UNKNOWN Five . 
UNKNOWN Outl you are not lik outlier . 
UNKNOWN Seven Okay okay okay okay . 
UNKNOWN Sorry , I have them Of cour Of course the most difficult question for the end . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Alright , now here's the sixty million Dollar question , well , twenty five twenty five Euro question . 
UNKNOWN Of course I'll buy the banana . 
UNKNOWN What do you what do you guys reckon ? 
UNKNOWN I'll say five . 
UNKNOWN Well Twenty five Euros . 
UNKNOWN I'll say five . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN I find it quite cheap actually . 
UNKNOWN I dunno . 
UNKNOWN If i i it depends , if you live in in Switzerland or you live in I don't know . 
UNKNOWN Cheap . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , so the target price is for all Europe , or only for rich countries ? 
UNKNOWN It's more targeting U_K_ or So this is selling costs , not production costs . 
UNKNOWN Wha the initial specifications were for the whole all Europe or Yeah this is the the initial specifications . 
UNKNOWN Uh Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah yeah sure . 
UNKNOWN Um Five . 
UNKNOWN I would say six . 
UNKNOWN It's quite cheap actually . 
UNKNOWN I'd say two . 
UNKNOWN Why ? 
UNKNOWN I don't want a banana on my living room table , a banana remote . 
UNKNOWN Aw , should be nice in your It's kitsch . 
UNKNOWN No but it's really handy actually if you see . 
UNKNOWN It is handy , it's handy , but it it's terrible . 
UNKNOWN It's it's so handy . 
UNKNOWN And then Anyb anybody who comes here anybody who comes to your home he'll at least ask once what is this . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but it's not a positive thing . 
UNKNOWN It's a very positive thing if you see like that . 
UNKNOWN Well , you know , it's it's handy , it's ergonomic , but it's a banana . 
UNKNOWN Well , don't forget well , don't for don't forget who we're targeting also who are f f who are wh yeah , youngst youngst No well yeah I if you would be young . 
UNKNOWN Youngsters . 
UNKNOWN Actually maybe Yeah I change the question . 
UNKNOWN Yeah but it says I , I would buy this , so . 
UNKNOWN Not telling that you are young . 
UNKNOWN Li li like a teenager for instance . 
UNKNOWN No , it's I . 
UNKNOWN Okay you're you're crazy teenager and you like fun things . 
UNKNOWN I would buy S s Still I I'd say two . 
UNKNOWN You want to flaunt . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN You with your girlfriend or something . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , you want to show the beautiful banana you have . 
UNKNOWN Or might be it does some other kind of thing but Uh yeah , crazy . 
UNKNOWN I don't think I at any stage in my life I would want a banana remote control , really . 
UNKNOWN Okay so you s you give oh yeah yeah I know I know . 
UNKNOWN I can say , maybe there is a market for it , I dunno . 
UNKNOWN So you say two . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I say five . 
UNKNOWN F I d I say five . 
UNKNOWN You say ? 
UNKNOWN So what's the new question ? 
UNKNOWN And you have saved it ? 
UNKNOWN So yeah upload the Yeah it's two different situations . 
UNKNOWN You'll have to reload . 
UNKNOWN Uh yeah , I think so . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so , it depends if uh If I had t if I had to spend twenty five Euro , if that was like my limit , maybe I would buy it . 
UNKNOWN If you really need an universal remote control or if you would change your remote control for a n for a new one . 
UNKNOWN Yeah that's two different question . 
UNKNOWN Because the other twenty five Euro remote controls are probably gonna look worse than a banana . 
UNKNOWN They're not going to be as And they they might not be a as easy as this yeah . 
UNKNOWN Ugly . 
UNKNOWN And it yeah this is gonna f you know handy to use . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So ? 
UNKNOWN What now ? 
UNKNOWN S I go slightly up . 
UNKNOWN I stick to five . 
UNKNOWN What range ? 
UNKNOWN Although it still has it still has the word of course at the beginning so I dunno . 
UNKNOWN Six . 
UNKNOWN Six . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN W we have six , five Three So we are six , five , four Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I'd give it I'd give it a I give it a four now . 
UNKNOWN Six ? 
UNKNOWN Six ? 
UNKNOWN Six , five , four . 
UNKNOWN Six , so it's uh five point five , or less . 
UNKNOWN So So and last question , will I change my rem change my remote control from Mando banana . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um , zero . 
UNKNOWN No uh we can't . 
UNKNOWN So one . 
UNKNOWN Actually yeah , I we Five ? 
UNKNOWN Well if . 
UNKNOWN No uh let's say I'll put two . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I'd say three , I mean my remote control is kinda at home is pretty terrible . 
UNKNOWN If it was change my remote control of my D_V_D_ player for a Mando banana then I would be more inclined to but uh 'cause it's really bad but uh I'd say a three . 
UNKNOWN It's for the T_V_ . 
UNKNOWN I'll still give it five . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Two three five two three fi and two . 
UNKNOWN You are romantic , really . 
UNKNOWN I would say two . 
UNKNOWN So it's somewhere three point five I think . 
UNKNOWN So it's r Yeah , three point five . 
UNKNOWN Who is the outlier ? 
UNKNOWN Wh wh you said five ? 
UNKNOWN No I said five . 
UNKNOWN No no you say five , he is the outlier . 
UNKNOWN Okay just just do a sum . 
UNKNOWN I don't know if it's a No because there are more yeah , we shouldn't sum like that . 
UNKNOWN It's not very promising but you know we're not young trendsetters . 
UNKNOWN Well maybe we should we should uh have a look globally glob Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Because the the last two questions is much more important than the rest actually . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Otherwise we wouldn't we will not sell . 
UNKNOWN Is there some some formula you're using that says you have to sum them up ? 
UNKNOWN Uh no I didn't anything . 
UNKNOWN Well just leave it at that then . 
UNKNOWN Oops . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , the uh Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So maybe maybe w we can we should stick to general feeling . 
UNKNOWN We can had uh have a out of these numbers , which which is that well we should go for it . 
UNKNOWN Do you want me to sum o I think it's not S Actually what's the differen Too expensive . 
UNKNOWN Problem with connectors ? 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN I think it it kind of you just lose information if you sum it , so . 
UNKNOWN Yeah it's it's funny . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So let's move uh let's move on . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , sure . 
UNKNOWN Okay , now now we have to mm to estimate uh the cost okay . 
UNKNOWN So I prepare an Excel sh uh an Excel sheet. 
UNKNOWN Um well we are going to calculate the production costs . 
UNKNOWN We should we should be below twelve point five . 
UNKNOWN So I already uh put some pu some numbers here , okay . 
UNKNOWN We are going to go through so this is the number the mm number of components we need for this thing . 
UNKNOWN So it appears that there were things that we didn't thought about . 
UNKNOWN Uh and also things that I uh I d I forget to uh to put like solar cells . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Well we decided against the solar cells so You mean , charging it by shaking the banana . 
UNKNOWN Solar cells , yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah , we said no to that . 
UNKNOWN Oh yeah finally we say no . 
UNKNOWN Okay so let's let's go let's go let go through all the lines . 
UNKNOWN So hand dynamo . 
UNKNOWN This something we didn't thought about . 
UNKNOWN But Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think rechargeable batteries will take care of the power thing . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN To bring the cost Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay so we we stick to battery , one . 
UNKNOWN No kinetic also . 
UNKNOWN I don't I don't see the difference between kinetic and dynamo . 
UNKNOWN Well maybe dynamo is like you have to actually Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Ah you have to ah okay I see so kinetic is really uh shaking the banana . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Crazy . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So those banana is falling . 
UNKNOWN Let's go ahead . 
UNKNOWN So we we st only have one for battery . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Uh then for electronics um so I didn't put anything for the . 
UNKNOWN So we have the regular chip on the print, which is one . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And that's it . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN No so we hin Yeah so one . 
UNKNOWN And we have sample speaker . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN the cost of that is very high . 
UNKNOWN Ooh ye ye ye the cost is increasing . 
UNKNOWN Well actually that that no that sample speaker is not we we're not using that , we're just using the the very beep simple beep , that s that sample thing is like the voice recording and everything . 
UNKNOWN So we are The beep . 
UNKNOWN Uh-huh . 
UNKNOWN That's what Okay so I'll remove it . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I say that Yeah . 
UNKNOWN S So don't we need a Oh there is no listing for r radio frequency thing . 
UNKNOWN And we have sev Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So Yeah maybe . 
UNKNOWN So we we'll put some extras , if there is something . 
UNKNOWN We'll see later . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Okay so in for the case um I put single curved . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN To reduce the cost , it's okay . 
UNKNOWN Well , wait a second , no , it's it's double curved , it's got a c , it's uh Well d yeah it's monotonic but it's got but if you hold it if you hold it that way that's two curved , one on this side , one on that side , but they're opposite sides . 
UNKNOWN Because we have two things . 
UNKNOWN Oh it's got all the directions so don't worry . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN It's got a direction . 
UNKNOWN Well . 
UNKNOWN What a what i if I put one here . 
UNKNOWN This is actually I mean this probably this probably actually costs more than three if you Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah so let's put one here in the then instead of single oka all right . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So we stick to plastic , it cost nothing . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN That's right . 
UNKNOWN Well no didn't we say we wanted to do a rubber if you drop it ? 
UNKNOWN No , it's too no . 
UNKNOWN It's too expensive . 
UNKNOWN Well when okay . 
UNKNOWN We're already at eleven . 
UNKNOWN Well we we'll come back we'll come back and see if we can fit it in . 
UNKNOWN Okay so I put rubber one . 
UNKNOWN Okay so special colour , yellow . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh for the interface we have We have three . 
UNKNOWN We don't have any push buttons . 
UNKNOWN No , we have two push buttons . 
UNKNOWN No that is a scroll wheel itself , it'll be put in that . 
UNKNOWN Huh . 
UNKNOWN No no . 
UNKNOWN We have two scroll , and we have three push buttons . 
UNKNOWN Ah okay , okay . 
CONFUSION Uh . 
UNKNOWN Okay , okay . 
UNKNOWN Actually whe whe when you wrote regular chip you should put two , because there is another chip here . 
UNKNOWN Okay it's gonna have to be plastic . 
UNKNOWN And No it's no chip . 
UNKNOWN This is just radio frequency . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Th This is no chip . 
UNKNOWN Yeah but you need Fo i it does nothing actually ? 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN There's no chip there . 
UNKNOWN It just emits the signal . 
UNKNOWN It's just Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And the receiver accepts it and that's it . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN Just se sends the signal , that's it . 
UNKNOWN Just only . 
UNKNOWN It's a recharger thing and uh Well I actually did um think about it myself but I thought you know because you could potentially you know you could be pushing it down as you scroll it for a instead of a turbo button but you know the turbo button does add that extra class . 
UNKNOWN Okay w we didn't think a thought about uh integrated scroll wheel push buttons . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , so Yeah . 
UNKNOWN You know . 
UNKNOWN So I mean if we're if we're over budget then maybe we could we could rethink that . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So no L_C_D_ , so for we have no button supplements , right ? 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN Uh well in fact could we could not we consider this button as a button supplement because oh no , these are these are for colours , co and special forms , special colours and special materials . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN No we're not we don't need anything special for the buttons . 
UNKNOWN So Okay so we are over budget . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So first thing which we should take care of is , instead of rubber , let it be plastic . 
UNKNOWN Make it plastic instead of rubber . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And then we're basically o on budget except for you know ten cents . 
UNKNOWN And uh that much money will be required for the base station , which is not there . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So mayb in fact n we have to put two here because it cost nothing . 
UNKNOWN Yeah well pl the base station is made out of m many units of plastic . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN That's right . 
UNKNOWN So might be ninety centimes for the the remaining things which the cord and everything which'll go That's right . 
UNKNOWN Exactly exactly so we have margin for that stuff . 
UNKNOWN Does that include charging circuitry and everything ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah maybe . 
UNKNOWN Okay good . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Wha Excellent . 
UNKNOWN So what do we do with the extra profits ? 
UNKNOWN Um we'll invest in R_ and D_ . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN The next fruit . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So well we're under the the the cost . 
UNKNOWN So we can go to through to project evaluation . 
UNKNOWN Okay so now we have a product which nobody would would buy . 
UNKNOWN Would yeah , would buy . 
CONFUSION Sorry ? 
UNKNOWN No we have a product which none of us would buy . 
UNKNOWN Yeah because th th the evaluation project Ah would buy , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Which is different . 
UNKNOWN Which is different . 
UNKNOWN None of us will buy it . 
UNKNOWN No it's people in in in Milan and uh in Paris that are gonna buy it . 
UNKNOWN Massively , yeah . 
UNKNOWN We're n yeah . 
UNKNOWN We're not in Milan or Paris . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Uh you have been in Milan a couple of times , so . 
UNKNOWN Actually there were a lot of That's 'cause I'm sick of Milan . 
UNKNOWN This is a battery . 
UNKNOWN And you said the lowest . 
UNKNOWN This is what we which you can mm It did yeah . 
UNKNOWN S Detachable battery . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , for the batteries Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Extra battery , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Exac Well in fact I I did not know I didn't know really what to say here . 
UNKNOWN Okay so um project process . 
UNKNOWN If uh if you have any ideas of what we can we can say . 
UNKNOWN So I don't I don't I don't understand what what they mean by satisfaction um and for and for example . 
UNKNOWN Should it be more like um like a status of of the these meetings in fact . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah well in fact uh we we use a little bit the white board and the digital pen , not that much . 
UNKNOWN I dunno I think we had a fair bit of creativity . 
UNKNOWN Oh yeah it's really creative . 
UNKNOWN And uh but I think one thing we m missed out of this whole process was a um like a focus group with the actual people we're targeting . 
UNKNOWN We needed some of these kind of young trendsetters to come in and play with the banana and you know see if they see if they like it . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN They like that . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah maybe we should go through , yeah an uh evaluation . 
UNKNOWN Because yeah the evaluation for us is is kind of pointless . 
UNKNOWN Biased . 
UNKNOWN So maybe you should we should do a kinda evaluation in the streets like asking to young peoples well , do you like to have a banana as a remote control . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Because it it would also be interesting to uh you to know find out if we have a market in really young children as well , to see you know how to how to market this thing . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause you know if well I mean maybe you don't wanna give all your kids their own remote because they'll be changing the channel all the time but you know maybe in some households where there is you know a T_V_ for each kid , then you know , banana remote control could be fun for them as well . 
UNKNOWN Might have to drawa face on it . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So but I think that's something we need to to work on next time is really finding out more about the target market . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN Any any new ideas we could uh we could investigate next time ? 
UNKNOWN Dunno , oranges ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN The cost of the thing can be made more than might be . 
UNKNOWN Because I think it's just the optimal , what we have done for the cost which we are looking forward to . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think there are ways we could maybe simplify the Well just the the the circuit board that we're using inside , I'm not sure really how complicated our um our needs are . 
UNKNOWN Interface . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN I mean all we have is two push buttons and two scrollers , do we really need an integrated circuit to you know to process that . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So more general remote control instead of just focusing on uh on T_V_ . 
UNKNOWN That's right . 
UNKNOWN The complexity shouldn't be much higher . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN For you said if it good for D_V_D_ then I would Bye . 
UNKNOWN And also fo you know for mood lighting and and stuff , that would be rather cool . 
UNKNOWN I think that's actually something that should be in version two , is the ability to you know to control things other than the T_V_ and not just electronic equipment but you know the whole environment of the room . 
UNKNOWN Integrate . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Very good . 
UNKNOWN So What else ? 
UNKNOWN So Well done . 
UNKNOWN I think we we can go home . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Home ? 
UNKNOWN Happily satisfied . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Maybe maybe we can hassle the the production department to to make a a real prototype that we can use at home to to evaluate . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN Okay so thanks very much . 
THANKS Thank you . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
FAREWELL Bye . 
THANKS Thank you . 
UNKNOWN Now what . 
UNKNOWN 'Kay , hello everybody . 
UNKNOWN Uh , I guess you all know what is it about , you all received the email, I guess . 
UNKNOWN Uh , we are actually doing this meeting to start a new project which is about designing a remote control . 
UNKNOWN So I'm going to be the project manager of this uh project . 
UNKNOWN And uh so I'm present myself . 
UNKNOWN I'm Fabien Cardinaux and uh I I guess you can present yourself . 
UNKNOWN So I dunno , you can starts . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so my name is Petre . 
UNKNOWN You can call me Petre , or Peter if you like . 
UNKNOWN I don't care . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Uh my name's Bob Mor . 
UNKNOWN And you are ? 
UNKNOWN In the project ? 
UNKNOWN Uh , in the project I'm supposed to be the technic . 
UNKNOWN Oh , sorry . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN So my name's Bob Morris . 
UNKNOWN I'm the Marketing Expert for this project . 
UNKNOWN Bob , okay . 
UNKNOWN Bob yeah . 
UNKNOWN My name is Hamed Getabdar , and uh I'm going to be Interface Designer in this project . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So , uh , so today we are doing a short meeting to present the project , so um We are gooding we are going to present the tool we are we are going to use during all this project . 
UNKNOWN We are talking about the project plan , and we are going to to discuss about st our first ideas and so on , and , yeah . 
UNKNOWN So we have around twenty five minutes to do this meeting . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN So what is the goal of this project ? 
UNKNOWN Is to design a new remote control . 
UNKNOWN So it should be , of course , new and original , and um it should be trendy , and user friendly . 
UNKNOWN That mean it's a very challenging project , and uh uh . 
UNKNOWN So w it's we will try to do our best , and hopefully come with something very new and that people want to buy . 
UNKNOWN So , um So what's uh what are we going to do during this all this project ? 
UNKNOWN So it's more like we are going to do inv individual work all in o in o our specialities and we are going to meet each other quite often to discuss and to find a good way . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Yeah and everything is will be like this . 
UNKNOWN Um so now we are going to to get used t to to the tools we are going to use all during all this project . 
UNKNOWN So we can try to use uh the whiteboard here . 
UNKNOWN So uh . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN For example we can try to write what is our our favourite animal and write the f our favourite characteristics about it . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFUSION Uh . 
UNKNOWN So uh So I will ask you all to do the same . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Just to get used to the whiteboard . 
UNKNOWN So probably I would try to try to drawthe animal . 
UNKNOWN Well sh should I drawthe picture of the animal ? 
UNKNOWN I I th I think I should . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah , you can drawthe picture , of course . 
UNKNOWN Yeah go ahead . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Okay , American , um . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN I would use the bird . 
UNKNOWN So I tried to sketchit out . 
UNKNOWN I had to first uh write it down because I am not absolutely sure if I can drawit , but ah . 
UNKNOWN Can you recognise it as a bird ? 
UNKNOWN Okay it's your turn to Oh it's okay . 
UNKNOWN Okay , okay . 
UNKNOWN So I think my favourite animal would be a c a cat . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN That's its head . 
UNKNOWN Um I probably like cats the most because they're cuddly and furry and uh playful . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN I dunno if I should go with this . 
CONFIRMATION Thanks . 
UNKNOWN If it is enough line . 
UNKNOWN I'm sorry . 
UNKNOWN Maybe put it up Put it a Maybe put it on the desk or something . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I should get used to the tool , so . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Oh just wait a little bit . 
UNKNOWN C could we put it here , to make it as straight as possible ? 
UNKNOWN Ah probably not . 
UNKNOWN They should be remote . 
UNKNOWN Okay , it it works like this . 
UNKNOWN Uh , that's better . 
UNKNOWN Okay , thanks . 
UNKNOWN Your lapel microphone's fallen off . 
UNKNOWN Are you left-handed ? 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN Oh , pity . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Should I clean ? 
UNKNOWN Okay , I think like horses uh because they are strong and beautiful , so if I want to write it here , I think I can . 
UNKNOWN Never mind . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN Ah , it's maybe better if you leave it . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Maybe we should just continue . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , don't worry about it . 
UNKNOWN , no worry . 
NEGATION No . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN You won't drawthem , or ? 
UNKNOWN You can drawit , if you want . 
UNKNOWN I dunno if I can . 
UNKNOWN Just try . 
UNKNOWN I would like to see how it looks like . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN It may be like a cow or I dunno , whatever . 
UNKNOWN I'm not good very good in drawing. 
UNKNOWN Okay , so this is very It's a bird , I think . 
UNKNOWN I dunno what is it . 
UNKNOWN No , I think it's clear . 
UNKNOWN Four . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I'm shameful Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Oh that's good , it's good . 
UNKNOWN It's okay . 
UNKNOWN It's in it's indeed beautiful . 
UNKNOWN Good . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , and strong . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Bob . 
UNKNOWN Have to remember it . 
UNKNOWN Bob . 
UNKNOWN So good um So , let's talk about money . 
UNKNOWN Uh we are going to to sell we want to sell uh this remote control for twenty five Euro Euro . 
UNKNOWN And uh our expected profit will be around fifty million Euro . 
UNKNOWN And uh we are trying to to have a market all around the world . 
UNKNOWN So n not only for Switzerland , but for the world . 
CONFUSION Uh . 
UNKNOWN So , um . 
UNKNOWN The We expect a production cost of maximum uh twelve point fifty Euro . 
UNKNOWN Per unit , I guess . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , of course . 
UNKNOWN Y oh okay . 
UNKNOWN Um , so we can start today to have a first idea of what we want to do what are our experiments with remote control , and any idea ? 
UNKNOWN So , if you have some experience , good or bad , with remote controls you can share it and say what you f what is your idea . 
UNKNOWN Anything . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Well , from experience , um I've had remote controls in the past that have had very they've had lots and lots of buttons and they've been very small , and it's been very hard to to to use , because there's so many buttons , and you know it's very hard to see which buttons do what , and the buttons are very small and very hard to press . 
UNKNOWN Um and and normally you only every use , you know , on a T_V_ remote you only ever use , mostly , you know , f four or f six buttons . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
SURPRISE Oh .
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN So it's frustrated me in the past , th that . 
UNKNOWN Okay , I have also some points uh . 
UNKNOWN Maybe two points . 
UNKNOWN Uh first would be that in current remote controls there is no back light , so if you are if you are uh playing with this in the dark room it's it's probably worth to to have something like uh back light . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And maybe it could be also dependant on the the amount of of light in the room , so that if if it's in the day it doesn't need to be back lighted because it works on the battery , so . 
UNKNOWN So something like this . 
UNKNOWN And the second thing , f second point from me would be that in a normal remote control there is uh there are two buttons for volume control . 
UNKNOWN But I prefer like a potential-meter or something like . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Ah , okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN You know , some slider or Not just two discrete buttons for volume , but something which Yeah , but I can reach In uh one second I can mute it down , or or make a high volume . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Okay , n Is that because the of the discrete volume levels , or is that Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Are you not afraid that if you take your remote control you can move the slideand it could the the volume can go up very quickly and it can Yeah , also if y when you take the the remote control , for example on the table , you take it and you push the button and everything is very loud , and you have a heart attack . 
UNKNOWN Ah , n . 
UNKNOWN If it drops to the floor then it starts to scream . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , f It depends what what you feel about that . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah but we can we can think of these things afterwards , but if you have some more noteson that . 
UNKNOWN Yeah so you can Do you have something ? 
UNKNOWN Uh I Yeah , just a simple experience . 
UNKNOWN I uh I prefer um remote control working with radio waves , because remote control working with infra-red rays you should you should you should keep it in a specific direction and then try it hard to tune . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's true . 
UNKNOWN Yeah without obstacles and . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Let's continue . 
UNKNOWN I have a meeting in five minutes , so maybe we should hurry . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Okay , just a second . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN So we will close uh this meeting . 
UNKNOWN So we will have a next meeting in uh thirty minutes . 
CONFUSION Um . 
CONFUSION Uh . 
UNKNOWN The So I will ask you to do some work . 
UNKNOWN Uh the the interface interface developer will work on the on the design of the remote control , start to to have new idea and read about Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Which i which is Hamed , ? 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN He's the Industrial Designer ? 
UNKNOWN No , you're the Industrial Designer . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh I am the Technical Designer , I dunno which one , uh v . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN Yeah , I think that's the first . 
UNKNOWN Industry and Oh . 
UNKNOWN Uh-huh . 
UNKNOWN I_D_ . 
UNKNOWN Industrial Designer . 
UNKNOWN And the second one is the User Interface Designer . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN User Interf Okay . 
UNKNOWN And then last one's marketing , which is me . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so I'm the first one . 
UNKNOWN So , um For the User Interface Designer , which is Hamed um , uh , you are going to work on the technical functions of the remote control . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN I see . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN And for the Marketing uh Manager , I dunno , okay , which is Bob , uh you are going to try to to find the user requirements f uh for the remote control . 
UNKNOWN Um , you will receive by emailuh the specific instructions and uh by your personal coach . 
UNKNOWN Sign . 
UNKNOWN Yep finished . 
UNKNOWN So I see you in thirty minutes . 
UNKNOWN Great , okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Okay , thanks . 
UNKNOWN Thanks guys . 
FAREWELL Bye . 
FAREWELL Bye . 
THANKS Thank you . 
CONFUSION Uh . 
UNKNOWN So um nice to see you again . 
CONFUSION Uh . 
UNKNOWN So , uh . 
UNKNOWN Tod uh for this meeting I will take the notesand do the minutes. 
UNKNOWN Uh so we will see our three presentations. 
UNKNOWN Um we will start with the uh Manager Expert wi who will talk about uh user re requirements , whats user needs and what it desire for this devi device . 
UNKNOWN Okay , can I have the laptop over here , or ? 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN Oh , I don't think so . 
UNKNOWN I think you have to come here . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Have to get up . 
UNKNOWN I dunno . 
UNKNOWN I think it should stay . 
UNKNOWN Excuse me . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's it . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Should stay in the square here . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Oh , maybe . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so basically I'm gonna present some findings of a study we conducted uh into uh what users want in this remote control . 
UNKNOWN Oh , you can put it here . 
UNKNOWN Oh that's okay , it's jus Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um so first of all we what we did is we um conducted a an experiment with a hundred test subjects . 
UNKNOWN Um we put them in a in our um usability laboratory and got them to , you know , um play with remote controls , and also to complete , after they'd done that , to complete a questionnaire uh to tell us what they like and what they don't like in remote controls . 
UNKNOWN So basically um the major things we found out was that um basically users don't like the look and feel of of most remote controls that are currently on the market . 
UNKNOWN Um they , you know , seventy five percent of the people we we uh did the experiments on , found that rem remote the remote controls that they'd used in the past were ugly . 
UNKNOWN Completely ugly . 
UNKNOWN Um they they didn't match the operating behaviour of the user , that is , you know , the the way users use remote controls when they're watching T_V_ . 
UNKNOWN Um , that the layoutof the remote controls didn't match they way that they used it . 
UNKNOWN Um and thirdly they say that w half of the users that we um tested said that they only used ten percent of the buttons that uh are on remote controls . 
UNKNOWN Um so we collect we also some collected some usage statistics uh based on how these test subjects were using their remote control . 
UNKNOWN And from this we basically came up with the figure that the channel buttons , the channel selection buttons are the most by far the most used buttons on the remote control . 
UNKNOWN Um and you can see they're used a hundred and sixty eight times per hour on average , um , while the user's watching T_V_ . 
UNKNOWN Um the closest button that was used , well the cl the button that was used that was closest to the channel button was the teletext button , um which was used fourteen times per hour , followed by the volume button , which was four times per hour , um , all the other , all the other um buttons , such as ch um audio and picture selection um configuration buttons and things were used , you know , l approx well less than or equal to one times per hour . 
UNKNOWN Um we also asked users um which buttons had the most importance to them , you know , which which buttons they felt were the most important buttons on on the remote control . 
UNKNOWN And basically they came they said the channel , volume , and power buttons had the highest relevance to users , um note that only power was very infrequently used , it only had a b a a fr usage frequency of about one times per hour , but users ranked it as having a very very high relevance . 
UNKNOWN Um and the audio and picture settings had a very that well the users thought that um w the audio and picture settings were very uh weren't very important to them um , and they used them very infrequently a as well . 
UNKNOWN So we asked users what what um frustrates them the most about um current remote controls . 
UNKNOWN And fifty percent of the users said that uh what frustrates them is losing the remote control um somewhere in the room and not being able to find it . 
UNKNOWN Um they also said that it um it takes a lot of time to learn a new remote control , especially when there's many buttons and it's a , you know , a c a a unintuitive interface . 
UNKNOWN Um and then thirdly , they some users commented on the fact that the the you know the way that you have to hold and press buttons on a remote control ar are bad and um cause u repetitive strain injury . 
UNKNOWN We also asked some users about some specific features that they'd like to see in the on the remote control . 
UNKNOWN In particular , do they want an L_C_D_ d display , and secondly , do they think speech recognition uh is a useful feature to have on a remote control . 
UNKNOWN Um basically our findings are that um amongst a younger age groups uh the answer is umv overwhelmingly yes . 
UNKNOWN They want these features , they want these high technology features . 
UNKNOWN Um for instance , ninety one percent of pe of people aged between fifteen and twenty five said yes , they want these features . 
UNKNOWN Whereas um the the trend was as users as users um became older and older uh they were less likely to want these sort of features in a um in a remote control . 
UNKNOWN So I guess it depends on where we're focusing our our market . 
UNKNOWN Um and as our company motto is putting fashion in electronics , um I think we're focusing on the younger younger um target demographic , and so maybe we should think about adding these sort of high technology features into our remote control . 
UNKNOWN That's my dic that's my presentation. 
THANKS Thank you . 
THANKS Thank you . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So , um maybe now we can talk about a user interface and uh about the technical function of this device . 
UNKNOWN So uh Pet Peter , can you talk say something about that ? 
UNKNOWN Well , okay , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but the user user interface is responsible . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN B you think uh I I'm User Interface Manager . 
UNKNOWN Ah . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so . 
UNKNOWN Sorry , I'm Sorry . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Sorry . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN If I could go there with this cable . 
UNKNOWN You're scaring me with L_C_D_ man . 
UNKNOWN And speech recognition in remote unit , it will be very e expensive . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , it's true , but , you know , they're features that users want , so it's And our production cost of twelve fifty Euros per per unit is fairly high I think , so I think we can afford to to add these sort of features into our remote . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN At least we have couple of months t to work on it so so it will be cheaper finally . 
UNKNOWN Sh okay . 
UNKNOWN It is true . 
UNKNOWN Where's delete button ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Oh I'm sorry . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN That's the wrong one , I think . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , it's still Bob Morris . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN Presentationthree ? 
UNKNOWN Because you cancelled it . 
UNKNOWN Yeah you should have put yes . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN Click on yes . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so here is my presentationabout technical function design . 
UNKNOWN I will talk about different components and s of system and how they react together . 
UNKNOWN Okay , uh , first what is a remote control ? 
UNKNOWN Simply it's a device , as you know , for uh , for sending some commands by some waves to uh another device to to tell different commands uh with this device . 
UNKNOWN And the main idea we don't use any cable and we can rec react simpler with the device . 
UNKNOWN Uh i it has different blocks , different blocks . 
UNKNOWN Uh first is remote control have sh ha should have some electric circuits uh making interface with uh keyboard and uh r reading uh keyboard and reading the keyboard uh commands . 
UNKNOWN And then inter then make uh these keyboard commands , uh in interpret these int uh keyboard commands . 
UNKNOWN And then there should be uh an electronic circuit making uh electronic signals according to these commands and uh finally there is a transmitter which is a cord or a a diode making uh making uh waves to transmit through the air and uh uh this air this uh wave uh will be received by the by the other device like a television or whatever , to uh r to realise the command . 
UNKNOWN Okay , uh about what I found about uh different uh these different blocks are uh , usually there are two different methods uh to for designing a remote control . 
UNKNOWN They are based on infra-red uh waves or uh uh radio waves . 
UNKNOWN You still want me the presentation. 
UNKNOWN There are two different uh uh solutions I mean . 
UNKNOWN This is uh this can be uh uh the the differences the th between different kind of waves , infra-red or radio waves . 
UNKNOWN And uh also as uh I understood , and uh I think it was a part of uh Bob , uh uh presentation, people prefer to have uh to have uh the remote control with less button . 
UNKNOWN So for the electronic part , working and interfacing , with button , we should we should try to t try to design a remote control having uh some some simpler buttons or some rolling buttons to just to just to search between different options , and showing o something on T_V_ and putting less lesser stuff on the uh on the remote control . 
UNKNOWN And uh personal preferences , uh uh uh uh certainly a remote control with uh working with radio waves is uh preferred because uh you can pr you can take it in any direction and you don't need to tune it any way . 
UNKNOWN And uh uh again , using bigger buttons and less number of buttons are also preferred , as I see . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN That was my presentation. 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN I have a question . 
UNKNOWN Uh-huh . 
UNKNOWN Do you think radio waves um will interfere with other appliances in the home ? 
UNKNOWN Uh , I don't think so , because uh we can make uh we ca we can make this wave in a specific frequency . 
UNKNOWN So they can be in a range which is not inter interfering with the with other devices inside the home . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So can we use any any frequency ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , it should be okay . 
UNKNOWN We have the right to use any frequency ? 
UNKNOWN Uh no but as I know , there is a range for uh for this uh f for for uh for this stuff , for designing this circuit . 
UNKNOWN We can we can we can tune our uh transmitter to work in this range , and for this range we don't need to ask any permission . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN And what happen with uh radio waves when two neighbours have the same have our remote control , for example ? 
UNKNOWN And so do they have the same frequency , or ? 
UNKNOWN Uh for this I'm not uh I I don't know the solution , but one solution can be something like putting uh p password or something inside the wave , so the only your T_V_ can understand it Yeah , identification code inside the The password may simply uh or uh i identification code may simply solve this problem . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN A kind of identification , okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah f uh I know about this , since it's my it's exactly my field , so . 
UNKNOWN So Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It's uh kind of handshaking , uh , when starting to uh when you start to communicate with the your T_V_ then then it's like an handshaking protocol with your your remote . 
UNKNOWN So Okay . 
UNKNOWN So so if two two devices are trying to go to communicate with the T_V_ set then the the the one which has the more energy in the wave is chosen . 
UNKNOWN Well it can be a problem sometimes , but most of the time it works okay . 
UNKNOWN A specific uh remote control has a specific f Mm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah but we we don't have to think uh about this because I think as a function designer that we will use the already made uh circuits which we probably bu buy . 
UNKNOWN It's worth to buy . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN And they have these problems solved so . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So we don't have to think about these . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So , maybe you can talk about the function , and Open . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN I have only a couple of things because I had I struggled a bit with the software that I'm supposed to use in this uh uh in this company . 
UNKNOWN I was used to use Linux before , so . 
UNKNOWN But I tried to tried to break through this too , I guess . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Ah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN How to make it big ? 
UNKNOWN Slideshow . 
UNKNOWN Five . 
UNKNOWN Slideshow . 
UNKNOWN Okay , thanks . 
UNKNOWN It should work , so you can . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Oh so I will speak about working design . 
UNKNOWN That's the first slide. 
UNKNOWN Uh what uh I have to do ? 
UNKNOWN A look at what the other company Okay so uh presently I am looking what is possible to use , what circuits to use and stuff like that because uh I didn't work uh with these uh circuits so far so I have to look what what is a v a v available on the market for for the communication for the I_R_ circuits and so on , so I'm currently looking what is available on the web . 
UNKNOWN And uh I wanted to ask you m maybe afterwards , after after our discussion , if we have some contacts in some companies , so , which can reporton what is going on there , so , I would be glad if you can tell me about them . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So , you know . 
UNKNOWN Uh , okay findings , that's the point that I'm working on currently but uh so far I I was uh looking what what are the blue circuit , I mean radio wave radio frequency circuits are available now , but the prices I read are high . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So , I know that uh the user interface people and these speak about radio frequency waves because you can you can uh you can make the T_V_ do what you want even if you are in the bathroom or so on , but you know , when you are not close to the T_V_ you probably won't need to to change the program and so on and so I am I am voting for s to stick to the um infra-red control instead of R_W_ but we will discuss it later maybe . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
CONFUSION Uh . 
UNKNOWN Components to use , I'm not exactly sure what I will use for the design of the circuit . 
UNKNOWN It depends uh on whether we will use the L_C_D_ and mainly the speech recognition , because the speech rec Yeah ? 
UNKNOWN Are we um are we planning to take an off the shelf an O_E_M_ component for the radio wave circuit , or are we planning to construct our own circuit board ? 
UNKNOWN No no no no no . 
UNKNOWN This we this we buy I think , because it's rather cheap nowadays and it's not worth to construct ourselves . 
UNKNOWN Okay s So we just buy a circuit board and Okay . 
UNKNOWN Exactly . 
UNKNOWN But I'm not sure about the circuit which is responsible for speech recognition . 
UNKNOWN This I prefer that we should make ourselves . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN But it depends whether we take a decision to use it . 
UNKNOWN Same thing . 
UNKNOWN It's fairly expensive to use these circuits . 
UNKNOWN So , speech recognition well , L_C_D_ it's okay because it's common nowadays to use L_C_D_ , so I agree on using any kind of L_C_D_ , less buttons good for me as a as a designer of the circuit . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But the speech recognition we have to compare whether the price and the what does it offer , you know . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So what do you think would be the price , it would be out of range ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I'm Oh . 
UNKNOWN Or it would be maybe feasible ? 
UNKNOWN I was not thinking too much about the price . 
UNKNOWN But if we use the L_C_D_ uh even the radio frequency communication with the T_V_ set and the backlight and uh related things like the photo diodes and stuff , it should be okay . 
UNKNOWN If we decide to use the speech recognition , then we probably could struggle but we'll see afterwards . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN It depends of you if if the M_E_ or U_I_D_ , I'm sorry about the names , I don't really know , uh want to have it like in metal or in plastic , these things , it it depends on you not Because the the the electronic device's price is not not so big in comparison to to the overall shape and stuff like that , so . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN We will discuss it afterwards . 
UNKNOWN Oh , this is nothing . 
UNKNOWN This is just my noteson what to use . 
UNKNOWN And uh my personal preference is yes , I would like also preferably to use R_W_ circuit , but from the point of view uh of the design and price , I would stick to I_R_s . 
UNKNOWN That's my opinion . 
UNKNOWN Uh I mean if infra-red uh circuit not not the radio frequency . 
UNKNOWN Why ? 
UNKNOWN Because it's simpler ? 
UNKNOWN Because because the the range where you can use it is fair . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN It's okay I think . 
UNKNOWN And the price is fairly cheap for this . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN It's a a price matter . 
UNKNOWN Well , depends . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Jus just the price . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Otherwise I don't care what I put there because it's the chip which I buy or which we buy . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So I I I think it's o y o . 
UNKNOWN What how much more expensive ? 
UNKNOWN Are we talking three times more expensive ? 
UNKNOWN Or ten times more expensive ? 
UNKNOWN Well , three to three to five . 
UNKNOWN Or Okay . 
UNKNOWN N not ten times , but it depends what what we Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah yeah . 
UNKNOWN That's still a lot . 
UNKNOWN I think it's it's probably not worth spending the extra money , because I mean all the other remote controls on the market have infra-red , so people don't expect anything other than infra-red . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So it's not worth spending the extra money . 
UNKNOWN Well I , oh On the other side , we want to have something new . 
UNKNOWN Th they are used to use it when they can see the T_V_ so , I don't know . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN You know , where we want to to have something new and So we I think we should still thinking about it . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But maybe . 
UNKNOWN But I think , based on my usability studies I th I feel that users are prioritise the look and the feel and the trendiness above , you know , the difference between infra-red or radio waves . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So I think we're better off spending money in the usability phase . 
UNKNOWN You the user interface , and management man , uh Uh okay , that's it for me . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Okay , thank you Peter . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN So um I have to inform you I receive an emailfrom the management bon board today and they have new requirements for the for the remote control . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Um first um , they say that's uh about something about t teletext . 
UNKNOWN Uh apparently it becomes from according to them it becomes out of date . 
UNKNOWN Out-dated . 
UNKNOWN And uh Because of the internet popularity and everybody has internet at home , and actually it's not useful to have teletext . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN So I think we can avoid the teletext . 
UNKNOWN Um the second thing is uh they suggest that that we should uh use the remote control only for T_V_ , not for D_V_D_ and other devices , because it make it it makes it's too complex and uh because we have not much time for this project we should stay on T_V_ on the only specific T_V_ remote control . 
UNKNOWN I agree . 
UNKNOWN The third the third one is uh about the the the image of the company . 
UNKNOWN So um uh we should we should keep uh The the product should be recognisable . 
UNKNOWN Uh , uh It's That mean we should use the colour of our company and maybe put somewhere the s the slogan of the company , which is uh , we put fashion of in electronics . 
UNKNOWN So , when people see the the remote control , they should say oh it's from Real Reaction and he s they should recognise the company . 
UNKNOWN So , um So now we we should take the decision what we are going to what function we will have on this uh on this remote control . 
UNKNOWN So , mm , are we going to use L_C_D_ , speech recognition ? 
CONFUSION Uh . 
UNKNOWN Well , should we start with just the core , the basic functions that we need . 
UNKNOWN And then we can move on to the more advanced features . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN Maybe , maybe . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so the available things are L_C_D_ , the buttons and everything . 
UNKNOWN Uh radio frequency depends . 
UNKNOWN And , well the recognition it depends on you guys . 
UNKNOWN Yeah but first maybe what is what are the usual function of a standard remote control ? 
UNKNOWN You should probably speak . 
UNKNOWN I mean what do Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Okay , well , I mean the obvious one is changing channels . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think we should stick on very useful functions , because we want less button . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , okay . 
UNKNOWN So , turning channel , of course . 
UNKNOWN Volume setting . 
UNKNOWN Uh just one note to the chan channel changing . 
UNKNOWN Do we will we use only two buttons , or or like numbered buttons ? 
UNKNOWN I mean those nine plus one or two ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN I think it would be a b Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Because it's many buttons and we were speaking about lowering the number . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I Ah yeah . 
UNKNOWN On the other side we have more and more channels , and if you want to pass through all the channels to get the channel you want , it's Maybe maybe we could think of something more betweens , like uh Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay so so we keep all these all these buttons . 
UNKNOWN Yeah yeah , at least nine , ten button . 
UNKNOWN Like ten plus , five plus , one plus , one minus or something . 
UNKNOWN Maybe something like that . 
UNKNOWN Or using the names and the keyboard I dunno . 
CONFUSION Uh . 
UNKNOWN Or Or something . 
UNKNOWN Maybe Oh I don't know . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN Maybe we could have key buttons , like uh discovery channe like documentarychannel , and movies channel and And inside this this thing you can move , maybe switch . 
UNKNOWN You mean like hierarchical structure . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Like categorising channels . 
UNKNOWN If you want to see a movie you click on the movie button so you have all the movie channels and after you've you plus plus plus . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so s Oh sorry . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN I It just an idea . 
UNKNOWN I don't know what you think about that but . 
UNKNOWN So it requires the use of L_C_D_ probably , to to tell you Okay , so I'll make a note on L_C_D_ . 
UNKNOWN To have some feedback . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , probably , yeah , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN We could maybe also c um incorporate Petre's idea of the um slider for the volume , with the channel . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So we c you could quickly just through many channels . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Like roller for the Yeah . 
UNKNOWN For the channels , perhaps . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Anything else ? 
UNKNOWN So we've got channel and volume . 
CONFUSION Um . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So we are still s speaking about the common devices or we are inviting the new one ? 
UNKNOWN I think so . 
UNKNOWN I think basically the core functions we want , and then more advanced ones . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN What about the settings of the T_V_ ? 
UNKNOWN Because it's button we don't use very often , but it's we need it anyway . 
UNKNOWN So uh we don't have any uh we don't have uh we should just design the remote control and we sh we don't have any access to the to the T_V_ design or we can change some design . 
UNKNOWN So Yeah , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Because one solution for this um uh uh ch changing channels is to see a summary of all channels , some some preview of all channels and then you can Yeah . 
UNKNOWN On the screen , you mean ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah b Not on the control , on the screen , on the T_V_ screen . 
UNKNOWN Not on the control , but on the screen . 
UNKNOWN Well , this would avoid L_C_D_ , then . 
UNKNOWN I don't Oh , I don't but I don't think we're we're the ones . 
UNKNOWN And then Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN I mean this remote control we're developing is a generic control for all T_V_s , I think . 
UNKNOWN I don't know if it's possible to to watch something on T_V_ Yeah . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN W I I think it it would be better to to stick to the remote control and not to bother the T_V_ to to to printthese things . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Well it wi it will be still more expensive , but for the L_C_D_ and this stuff is no problem in the price . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So , what are we doing with the settings ? 
UNKNOWN Because settings if we want to do settings we need buttons for that and we want less buttons , so . 
UNKNOWN Maybe with the L_C_D_ we can do something with less buttons , but Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But then you don't want to make the L_C_D_ display too complicated at the same time . 
UNKNOWN I mean there's always we can always have these l less often used functions hidden somewhere , under a cover or at the back of under a slideor some Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Two T_V_s . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Oh yeah . 
UNKNOWN Like ma We we could have for example two buttons like simple mode and advanced mode . 
UNKNOWN Oh , the . 
UNKNOWN Or I dunno . 
UNKNOWN Or like children and grandfather's mode , and the , well the the user not the user , the man mana T_V_ manager mode . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Ah , I dunno . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So we have five minutes left . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Um . 
CONFUSION Uh . 
UNKNOWN So I think s the settings we th we are agreeing are agreed that they're required . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN It's just how to a Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN We should hide them somewhere . 
UNKNOWN Hide them , okay . 
UNKNOWN In the menus of the L_C_D_ or in the back of the remote control , or something like that . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh , okay , what else ? 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN I mean a power button's obviously uh required . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN This I was thinking . 
UNKNOWN Do we need a power button at all ? 
UNKNOWN Should should shouldn't we do it like sleep mode after five minutes of not using it ? 
UNKNOWN Because generally Yes . 
UNKNOWN It's it's a kind of setting , I think . 
UNKNOWN It should fit in those settings functions . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Settings . 
UNKNOWN Because it's not a very current useful function . 
UNKNOWN Uh , well I think when they say power button they mean to turn the T_V_ on and off . 
UNKNOWN No , I think it's after after five minutes or something a timer I I think , no ? 
UNKNOWN Well I I uh You don't need to every five minutes to keep it alive . 
UNKNOWN But if you're watching T_V_ for two hours , you don't want your T_V_ to turn off after five five minute I mean based on our usability studies again , um pe um people said that the power button was v a very relevant button . 
UNKNOWN Uh probably . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so we should keep this button . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Oh okay , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um , you know , it was nine out of ten re relevance . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so we we could p what we could probably do is to keep also to keep uh keep the L_C_D_ and all the buttons and stuff , we could make it like a opening opening style that if you open it you are you just turn on the T_V_ and if you close it , it will turn off the T_V_ . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN If if you like this , Because , well it's maybe question for you t Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN B Okay . 
UNKNOWN I think we need to concentrate on the , you know , the major usage of the th of the control , which is you sit down , you turn on your T_V_ , you change channels , you change the volume , you turn the T_V_ off . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um and all the other f functionality is not used very often . 
UNKNOWN So s yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , they can yeah they can be hide somewhere by a cover or something like this . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Like covering cu . 
UNKNOWN On the back , or For what ? 
UNKNOWN I mean like the Yeah but since we have the L_C_D_ , we didn't need too much button too many buttons . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , like mobile phone covering . 
UNKNOWN Um , okay , just um the decision of the power button . 
UNKNOWN Should we make it a button , or some some something which would be Uh power button . 
UNKNOWN I think a button . 
UNKNOWN A button is better . 
UNKNOWN I think it should be a bu Its own button on the front . 
UNKNOWN Ah oh yeah , yeah . 
UNKNOWN If it if it's a button or Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah a button , yeah I guess so . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Okay , one nice big button . 
UNKNOWN Old fashioned button , to satisfy the grandmothers . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So , any other suggestions or functions ? 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN S What about things like the clock and um timers ? 
UNKNOWN Do we still have the time ? 
UNKNOWN I I just wonder . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , we have still one or two minutes to talk , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN Well what w what was the question ? 
UNKNOWN Clock or Yes . 
UNKNOWN Uh um , you know , some func some features on the control to display a time , or t to display Probably not . 
UNKNOWN Usually it's already on T_V_ or something like that . 
UNKNOWN Yeah but since we want to control all the televisions , and and it would probably be worth to to set the timing on the remote , no ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Because if if the T_V_ turns on itself , it well you know , if the time The timer should be there . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN If we if we add the time , we have to have maybe a bigger display or something like that , and is it very useful ? 
UNKNOWN I mean , are users wants to have the time on the on the remote ? 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN This is the question . 
UNKNOWN Is it useful ? 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN It's a questi yeah , it's a trade-off . 
UNKNOWN W In my opinion we should have only useful thing and Because apparently they want The simpler it's is better . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN Ah , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay simple . 
UNKNOWN Did you did you ever use the like the timing of turning on the T_V_ , well And based on your Yeah but it can be on the display in in a corner all the time on the remote . 
UNKNOWN Very , yeah okay , very occasionally . 
UNKNOWN But I do use the I do use the display of the time quite often , but Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah that's okay , that's true . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so no time button . 
UNKNOWN No time on . 
UNKNOWN And uh do we need to include anything about the speech recognition and the speech commands , or ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Yes yes . 
UNKNOWN I think Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I I thin I think it will not take lots of place , we just need a microphone and the software , so , and it sh and it will be a little bit new and interesting , so people may be attracted to buy this stuff and it's not very difficult to uh put a software inside the the electronic device and put a microphone . 
UNKNOWN It doesn't take that much place and also that much It doesn't cost that much . 
UNKNOWN Yeah but we we should be careful about the battery life , then . 
UNKNOWN If we use the speech recognition . 
UNKNOWN So maybe we think we can think more about that , and discuss that maybe last time next time . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And uh yeah , now the meeting room is busy . 
UNKNOWN Somebody booked the meeting room just for at one P_M_ , and so we should leave . 
CONFUSION Uh . 
UNKNOWN So , um . 
UNKNOWN So now we are going for for a small lunch . 
UNKNOWN It's uh funded by the company . 
UNKNOWN And uh after we have uh thirteen minutes to to do indevel individual works . 
UNKNOWN And uh I will do the minutes. 
UNKNOWN And uh you are going to work on your individual works . 
UNKNOWN And uh you will receive as usual your specific instruction and so on . 
CONFIRMATION Okay , cool . 
THANKS Thank you everybody . 
UNKNOWN Okay Thank you . 
CONFIRMATION Thanks . 
UNKNOWN Hello , uh this meeting we are it's fo should be focused on the conceptual design of the remote control . 
GREETING Hello . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
GREETING Hello . 
UNKNOWN Um the goal of this meeting is to reach a decision at the end on the concept and I think the last time we talked about an a lot and we had a rough idea of what is going to be , but uh in th at the end of this meeting we have to to reach a decision . 
UNKNOWN So , uh we will have again three presentation, from all of you , and uh I hope it will be fast because I would like to have time to for long discussion and and decisions . 
UNKNOWN So , who wants to start ? 
UNKNOWN I s No , no , you you can start . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Okay , I'll start . 
UNKNOWN So start , uh Uh . 
UNKNOWN Can you open my presentation, please . 
UNKNOWN I'm number four . 
UNKNOWN Trend . 
UNKNOWN This one ? 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN Can you pass the mouse , please . 
UNKNOWN Oh okay , that's fine . 
UNKNOWN Turn . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um so basically I just want to presented to you present to you some recent results we've had from um looking at uh um some remote control market research and some fashion trends around the world . 
UNKNOWN Um the fashion trends we got from talking to our our contacts in the fashion industry based in Paris and Milan . 
UNKNOWN Um so f from our market research basically we've come to the conclusion that a fancy look and feel , um as opposed to a functional look and feel , is our number one priority . 
UNKNOWN Um fancy is is is is the , you know , highest priority . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Secondly um that our remote control needs to be techn technologically innovative . 
UNKNOWN Um so this is t number two priority but it's two times less important as the fancy criteria . 
UNKNOWN Um and third thirdly the easiness of use is is the um is is important as well , but again two times less important as the technologically innovativeness of the remote control . 
UNKNOWN From our f fashion people in Paris and Milan , um we've discovered that this year um fruit the fruit and vegetable motif will be the most important thing in in clothes , shoes and furniture . 
UNKNOWN So , I'm pretty confident that our remote control fits into the furniture category . 
UNKNOWN And also um the feel of material this year um is expected to be spongy . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um so hopefully our remote control reflects that s in some way . 
UNKNOWN What does it mean , spongy ? 
UNKNOWN Uh sort of um squishy . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Like soft , or something ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah soft , like a uh like a sponge . 
UNKNOWN Like a sponge . 
UNKNOWN I don't know . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I will see . 
UNKNOWN Um so in conclusion , we need a our remote control needs to be something that's really fancy , um has lots of technolog tech technology in it . 
UNKNOWN Um somehow would be good to have it related to fruit and vegetables with a spongy feel . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN And that it's easy to use and from our last meeting our you know Fabian told us that w you know one of the requirements is that we have to reflect the look and feel of our of th the Real Reaction company . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , uh yeah . 
UNKNOWN That's it . 
UNKNOWN Easy to use , is it uh a as much as important than technology or fancy thing . 
UNKNOWN It's less important , right ? 
UNKNOWN Less important . 
UNKNOWN So um fanciness first and then two ti you know , half as important as that is technology technology , and half important as technology is easy to use . 
UNKNOWN Yeah yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So . 
UNKNOWN So , Hamed , can you . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN The second one . 
UNKNOWN Could you please show the presentationnumber three . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN I think the biggest struggle will be the easy to use feature . 
UNKNOWN We'll see . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Number ? 
UNKNOWN Three . 
UNKNOWN Three . 
UNKNOWN This one ? 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN Just Could you please check if it is the first one or the second . 
UNKNOWN Uh , n n no , it's the first one . 
UNKNOWN The second one . 
UNKNOWN So it's not this one . 
UNKNOWN Uh yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So I am going to talk about a little bit about how this remote control should be appear to be more easy to use . 
UNKNOWN I think uh I think the feature easy to use is more important than being fancy , but okay , we can discuss about it uh later . 
UNKNOWN Um generally , generally uh this remote control uh uh should be should be something , in my opinion , uh the first feature is just to be easy to use . 
UNKNOWN So , the more frequent buttons should be larger , they should be placed in a good position uh uh inside the remote control . 
UNKNOWN And uh s uh I can conclude like this , that we shouldn't need to learn how to use it . 
UNKNOWN It should be we shouldn't need to es open a a t bookand uh start reading and uh learning how to use this uh this uh remote control . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So what I found out that uh as I said uh I think it's better to put uh more frequent uh uh uh ke uh buttons which are used more in the middle of the remote control , and they should be bigger in size . 
UNKNOWN Uh the shape of remote control should be in a way which can which should be taken easily in hand . 
UNKNOWN It should not be completely like uh a cube . 
UNKNOWN It should be it should have round edge , so uh then it's easier . 
UNKNOWN Exactly . 
UNKNOWN And maybe uh just like some toys , some joystick which is easier to take inside the hand . 
UNKNOWN And uh also f uh uh m because because customers doesn't like to buy lots of battery , it should not uh consume lots of energy . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN And my personal p uh preference is uh , as I said , uh just putting this buttons in a special places and covered some buttons which are not used uh that much like settings button , like mobile phone . 
UNKNOWN Usually some mobile phone cover the dialling number part , so we can cover these buttons which are not used or uh number buttons for the for the for the can channels , and just put uh volume change or s ch can uh channel change buttons uh uh in the remote control . 
UNKNOWN And if the user needed to do some more complex task uh he he can open the cover and then change settings or something like this . 
CONFUSION Uh . 
UNKNOWN And also uh I think if we put some some some some some buttons inside of the remote control it can be used easier . 
UNKNOWN Not on remote control . 
UNKNOWN I dunno if I can explain well . 
UNKNOWN But uh just inside . 
UNKNOWN For example , a sliding or rolling uh uh d uh stuff , if we put it inside then we can easily manipulate with uh thumb . 
UNKNOWN So it can be another uh preference . 
UNKNOWN And uh I dunno but uh I think usage of a speech recogn uh r recogniser can be good . 
UNKNOWN I know that it consumes lots of energy , but if we do it in some way that it asleeps when there is no sound and when it detects some sound it may consume less energy . 
UNKNOWN And I think it's good because it's something new and usually young people like something new . 
UNKNOWN So it may not be very useful but because it's new , people may buy it . 
UNKNOWN Uh I personally think there should be a big difference between uh between something . 
UNKNOWN Otherwise they prefer to buy something which is coming from a famous company , or . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN That's mine . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Uh okay , so good news from me uh uh for me from Hamed , but bad news from Bob obviously , because spongy design , I don't like it as Okay , so could you please , Fabien , open it . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I'm person two . 
UNKNOWN And which one , uh probably the first one . 
UNKNOWN I'm not sure but check the first one . 
UNKNOWN I Most of the things I have to write myself on the board , but Yeah , that's it . 
UNKNOWN This one , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Just It's only this slide? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN This this is just uh one thing I wanted to mention and show you that I just uh I just found this , that our company uh developed a s a seven f seven fingers or I'll just Yeah , seven seven inch T_ T_F_T_ screen , which is good news for us , since we wanted to include a display there . 
UNKNOWN Inch . 
UNKNOWN Uh so I I probably drawit down raw scheme . 
UNKNOWN Oh , . 
UNKNOWN This is this is the stuff that I can use to Okay , so the this will be like the overall scheme or overall requirements from the engineering point of view . 
UNKNOWN Oops . 
UNKNOWN Uh first thing is uh this will be the overall shape , no uh I'm not speaking about the real shape of the device , but the shape of the inside of the device . 
UNKNOWN So there will be some circuit uh for the power . 
UNKNOWN So , say power circuit here . 
UNKNOWN Uh the main energy will be taken from batteries that we can uh uh And if we decide to use the speech recognition stuff there , we must use additional source of energy , which I found the best is to use the solar cells which can which can uh supply everything . 
UNKNOWN I was computing all the all the things related to the speech recognition , and it's okay to use just uh two batteries and solar cells , so . 
UNKNOWN So no problem . 
UNKNOWN There can be also solar cell . 
UNKNOWN Uh the main board with all the circuits will take at least seven to seven centimetres , so this is my like hard requirement for the guys from the design . 
UNKNOWN So at least seven to seven . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN It depends where you put your screen , because the screen is uh seven inch , so it depends on you where where you put it . 
UNKNOWN It doesn't matter . 
UNKNOWN Um it's just one cord from from the main board to the screen which can be elsewhere . 
UNKNOWN So this will be T_F_T_ . 
UNKNOWN And on the main board we have the um interface to the microphone , which is somewhere , say here . 
UNKNOWN Interface to the microphone . 
UNKNOWN Then the graphical card uh for the T_F_T_ and the third unit is the I_R_ . 
UNKNOWN The good news is that we can uh we decided to use the infra-red unit because our company has also developed the chip for communication by the infra-red , including all the stuff inside , so it will be very cheap for us . 
UNKNOWN So infra-red here . 
UNKNOWN So the once again the overall requirements , seven to seven centimetres for the board , which has to be which can be spongy but has to be this size , and the T_F_T_ which is seven inches . 
UNKNOWN Um I have to check what I wanted to Uh from my point of view I don't care about the about the material used for the overall des uh ov all the device . 
UNKNOWN Can you fit any uh for example a T_F_T_ or any electronic device in a spongy thing , or is there any problem for that ? 
UNKNOWN For example , put electronic card on a spongy thing , I can I can imagine it could be a problem . 
UNKNOWN A all these things in in uh in this box are okay to put in in any shape , basically . 
UNKNOWN But we have to take care of the T_F_T_ . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN Well , sponginess . 
UNKNOWN Maybe it a good feature , since it takes if it's around the T_F_T_ then it's good , because it's just keeps it safe , I dunno . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So Okay . 
UNKNOWN Well maybe it can have two shells , a hard shell inside and a spongy shell outside . 
UNKNOWN So So Ca Can I ask a question . 
UNKNOWN Maybe put electronic in a box and a spongy thing around . 
UNKNOWN Well , it's maybe related to the U_I_ . 
UNKNOWN maybe after . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN A Yeah , that's all from me . 
UNKNOWN This seven inch T_F_T_ screen , how big is it in reality ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah ? 
UNKNOWN Well , seven to seven inches . 
UNKNOWN So like that . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN That's quite big . 
UNKNOWN Uh uh have we decided that we're gonna use this T_F_T_ screen ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah but To be honest , I was Yeah , honestly speaking I was thinking that it was seven centimetres initially , but it's seven inches . 
UNKNOWN No , I don't think it's seven by seven , I think it's seven the diagonal is seven . 
UNKNOWN Usually when they say seven inch I think it's the diagonal . 
UNKNOWN But I mean even even that is like this big . 
UNKNOWN Yeah yes . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I dunno I dun I dun One each . 
UNKNOWN But , yeah , . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But I I think we can we can cut it . 
UNKNOWN You can cut the T_F_T_ screen . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , no no problem , because because because then the size of the graphic card will be one fourth . 
UNKNOWN Let's go . 
UNKNOWN So Yeah , but no problem to to me to cut the screen . 
UNKNOWN So let's cut the T_F_T_ . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so Okay . 
UNKNOWN So so for the same price we have four screens now . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN These technical engineers , huh . 
UNKNOWN So , what's the size of the device ? 
UNKNOWN Ah well this is like this is almost nothing . 
UNKNOWN Seven to seven to at least well some three millimetres or something . 
UNKNOWN Even from my perspective seven t seven centimetres by seven centimetres is still Is it Can you hold that , or ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but we wanted the big buttons and stuff like that , you know . 
UNKNOWN Because if it's t too small we can we can lose it , at home , you know . 
UNKNOWN What user wants . 
UNKNOWN He wants a small remote control , or ? 
CONFUSION Uh . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , a small c control that they can hold in hand . 
UNKNOWN Uh uh with big buttons . 
UNKNOWN I thought that it it should fit in the hand or something . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN It's difficult . 
UNKNOWN A sm So maybe you can finish your presentation, and afterwards we will discuss about all this . 
UNKNOWN But is something that's seven centimetres square e easy to hold ? 
UNKNOWN W I I think so . 
UNKNOWN I if the roller buttons are on the side you don't have to catch it like that , but just like this , and you know follow follow Well , that's that's no task for me , but well seven to seven at least yeah , but Oh , okay . 
UNKNOWN Maybe this . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Okay thanks . 
UNKNOWN That's it . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN Uh , so I think we have a lot We have to take decision today , so I think we have to do some work to finalise our idea and take decisions . 
UNKNOWN Uh first I think energy it's a key problem because uh it depend what can we have as feature if we use only batteries , for example , or something like that . 
UNKNOWN Because can we have L_C_D_ and speech recognition with battery , and it's also r related to the size of the of the devi of the device ? 
UNKNOWN Not J uh just a point to the energy th things . 
UNKNOWN If we use the batteries , and the additional so solar cell , then it's okay for L_ uh speech recognition and L_C_D_ , so no problem in energy , I think . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So Okay . 
UNKNOWN But we have to use the solar cell . 
UNKNOWN So but Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Otherwise not . 
UNKNOWN Uh like but using how many batteries , for example ? 
UNKNOWN Are are what Maybe what is the size of the battery Okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah I was thinking just common A_A_ cells . 
UNKNOWN Uh one two Okay . 
UNKNOWN So like three to five centimetres , I dunno exactly , but . 
UNKNOWN So if we use s solar cells , um where is the sun if someone's watching T_V_ inside ? 
UNKNOWN S Uh d doesn't need to be sun . 
UNKNOWN It it's just the daylight , you know . 
UNKNOWN The television lights . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah well I I suppose that I suppose that uh that this remote control won't be in the in the room like this , where there is light only when when there are people , but . 
UNKNOWN At least when there is T_V_ you can get light from the T_V_ . 
UNKNOWN Yeah from the T_ I don't think it's enough , uh . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I dunno . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Ah it's a it's a compromise , no ? 
UNKNOWN At least it's new and maybe technology New technology . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's why I wanted to to include the speech recognition , because you wanted all the new things . 
UNKNOWN It's it's quite innovative , yes . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN And if you watch T_V_ outside it's very useful . 
UNKNOWN So I think before talking about the other thing , it's important thing it's the case . 
UNKNOWN Uh what what are gonna be the size , because its weight drives the other what we are going to use as features and so on . 
UNKNOWN For example for the for the L_C_D_ , if we choose to have a small device , we cannot use this um a such a a a screen . 
UNKNOWN Uh the s the screen is okay , but the board , uh that's the problem . 
UNKNOWN Well what what would you guess as a shape ? 
UNKNOWN Or what what would be the shape ? 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN I think I think their being uh large or small is not important . 
UNKNOWN The only important thing is to be able to take it in uh inside hand easily . 
UNKNOWN So let's say an average size , okay , and it should not be very heavy also . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN And I prefer to is it shouldn't have a uniform shape , so in the middle it should be a little bit thinner , maybe maybe . 
UNKNOWN So we c it's like like some joysticks . 
UNKNOWN You can take uh some some joystick you can take inside hand easier because it's it's designed for your f uh taking into account your finger shape and your palm shape . 
UNKNOWN So the general shape should be like this . 
UNKNOWN I think uh seven centimetre by seven centimetre is a little bit large . 
UNKNOWN So uh seven not seven but let's say five by ten it's I think it's that's my opinion . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Which is the same area . 
UNKNOWN It's easier . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Could you re could you redesign your board ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Five to ten . 
UNKNOWN Oh , five five centimetres by ten centimetres . 
UNKNOWN Well that Yeah , right . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I think it's feasib Well one um um How could we do it ? 
UNKNOWN We could put the board next to , well , under the L_C_D_ and for example make the L_C_D_ be totally unrelated to the thing that you hold in your hand . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Like holding something , and the L_C_D_ to be just on top of it , you know somehow . 
UNKNOWN Well But maybe let's stick to the s spongy thing , like one unit . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN I've I s I think the easiest thing would be to to have a smaller L_C_D_ , if it's possible . 
UNKNOWN Well fi five to ten it would be feasible . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so five to ten , I I think it's it's feasible . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So we are agree with a small L_C_D_ . 
UNKNOWN I'll make it . 
UNKNOWN Or uh or I don't know but I don't want to now invent something new , because we didn't discuss about it . 
UNKNOWN Fo Five by ten . 
UNKNOWN So using some L_C_D_s we can touch , so we can remove uh keys and just uh having uh , I dunno the name , L_C_D_ responding to fingers . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Touching the screen . 
UNKNOWN Something like Mm like tactile . 
UNKNOWN Tactile or something , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Mm , touch screen . 
UNKNOWN Touch screen , yeah . 
UNKNOWN So But for now if we don't want to use such kind of screens I I think we using a a smaller screen is better , because A smaller s Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN The problem is we have a limit in a month of time , so we cannot do something very new . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So let's go for a small L_C_D_ . 
UNKNOWN So Well it's it's definitely the obvious choice , with the colour of our company . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so Yeah , so so just just give me the the the five by ten numbers that you find the best and send it me and I will work it out . 
UNKNOWN Yeah okay . 
UNKNOWN So , five by s ten . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um so what about , so the case we talked about . 
UNKNOWN Um something easy to use , you said something easy to use but how does that fit in a fashion way , like with fruit and vegetable , and about the colour and logo of the of the company and so on , now , can we do that ? 
UNKNOWN My first idea is because our colour is more yellow , and the it should be easy to take in a hand , I thought about banana , or something like that , which is fruits , and A big banana . 
UNKNOWN Seven to ten banana . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Rather mango or something or . 
CONFUSION Um . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I mean what other what other fruit and vegetables Do you know of any any other fruit and vegetables that are yellow ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But it's just an idea . 
UNKNOWN I dunno what you think about , but Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I dunno if it can fit with the technology . 
UNKNOWN You are the specialists of that . 
UNKNOWN You mean banana . 
UNKNOWN Well , but If it's If it If the banana is big enough . 
UNKNOWN Then , yes . 
UNKNOWN So Yeah , and The screen has to be square ? 
UNKNOWN But if you want to look at the screen , no . 
UNKNOWN Well Well , it can be whatever you want . 
UNKNOWN I think this is not good . 
UNKNOWN Or it can be like a a shape , quite , uh with curves . 
UNKNOWN But if it's square then we get four screens out of one by cutting just . 
UNKNOWN It could . 
UNKNOWN But if you want some shape then we can only get like two screens out of seven to seven inches , so . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN It's like more more expensive to have shape like that . 
UNKNOWN But I don't care . 
UNKNOWN You know , if we fit this requirement . 
UNKNOWN Well I'd like a shaped screen . 
UNKNOWN I think that's more important than saving a bit of money on on the T_F_T_ screen . 
UNKNOWN Okay Yeah , m maybe the banana could be like a bit uh fatter than than the c c common one . 
UNKNOWN Okay okay . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , it should remember banana , but it's not doesn't have to b to be uh uh really the size and exactly the shape of a banana . 
UNKNOWN But Like modified banana , okay . 
UNKNOWN Well it we'll stick to banana , or ? 
UNKNOWN So we are agree with the banana thing ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , banana's good . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Mm-mm . 
UNKNOWN So , the last point we decided it's infra-red , I guess . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I think infra-red . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Everybody's agreed . 
CONFIRMATION Sure . 
UNKNOWN Uh , so that's it I think about the concepts . 
UNKNOWN You have other thing to add to this point , or uh no ? 
UNKNOWN So , uh about the user interface , so we are going to use L_C_D_ . 
UNKNOWN In the last meeting we talked about uh hidden buttons . 
UNKNOWN I don't know what we are going to do with that . 
UNKNOWN You talked about the buttons on the side Mm what ? 
UNKNOWN Like like peeling of the banana you s It would be cool , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , peeling of the banana . 
UNKNOWN Peeling of the banana , you know , should should discover the other buttons , which are hidden . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN And you mean the first layer would be spongy . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN First layer obviously spo Yeah , w It's it's like silly , but the people will really appreciate it , yeah I think . 
UNKNOWN So Is it is it possible to do that ? 
UNKNOWN It would be a great idea , but is it possible technically ? 
UNKNOWN Uh Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Like doing a spongy layer of the banana , and you open it . 
UNKNOWN I think if we if we have a spongy layer on the outside of the banana then it's easy to make that , you know , to manipulate that to hav be a cover that you can pull off and I think for sure . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , some Something like a plastic cover covering uh some interface , U_S_B_ interface as in the in uh digital camera . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN If you see it's like peeling . 
UNKNOWN You open a plastic cover and you see some U_S_B_ interfaces , some some interfaces for adaptor . 
UNKNOWN So keys can be uh buttons can be covered like this , with a plastic cover and uh when uh and when you open this cover it's like peeling a banana . 
UNKNOWN So , something like this . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but do you see that as a rigid thing , or like like a banana , something very soft , you can open like banana , or . 
UNKNOWN Well is it possible to make it soft ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah , yeah it's a lic like a plastic cover , so . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So I think if it's so then it's cool ? 
UNKNOWN So , I dunno what you think , Bob , but it would be great for users I think , and very good for marketing . 
UNKNOWN Definitely . 
UNKNOWN The softer the better . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Cool . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Honestly speaking , I cannot imagine it , so far , but it will be terrible . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Um . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN And setting buttons hidden in . 
UNKNOWN Mm , other remarks , or something , or . 
UNKNOWN Something we didn't talk about yes yet , or . 
UNKNOWN I think we are almost there . 
UNKNOWN Uh maybe , how can we , if we have a soft thing , like this , and to open it we have to attach it somewhere , I dunno how to do that technically , or . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN And how Yeah , maybe . 
UNKNOWN Pof . 
UNKNOWN We could use Velcro . 
UNKNOWN Or uh ma maybe a magnetic thing . 
UNKNOWN Yes , yeah it's a good idea . 
UNKNOWN Magnetic . 
UNKNOWN Ma magnetic oh . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah or a Yeah it can is it can be a plastic cover uh sticking to the to the all the stuff like uh with magnetic p uh magnetic uh magnetic uh materials in the border , so it's it sticks like refrigerator door , completely . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN And when you try to open it , it will be opened easily . 
UNKNOWN So you you can be sure that it will not be open while you're uh while while uh you are commonly using uh buttons on the banana . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN And what would be the matter here of the first layer I mean ? 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Likes . 
UNKNOWN Soft plastic , or Yeah , yeah , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I imagine some sort of vinyl thing . 
UNKNOWN In a in a sort of a with a suede sort of feel . 
CONFUSION Maybe . 
UNKNOWN Well since since the since the things like the like the screen and um how to say that , solar cell has to be has to be like kept kept in the shape , we cannot b uh So we need that the that the peeling uh I dunno but we should we should take care of these two two things . 
UNKNOWN So , if if uh the solar cell won't be visible while the banana is closed , then the material must be able to put the light inside , you know . 
UNKNOWN So that we can reach the energy out of it out of that . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN So you're saying is it possible to have a solar cell and this removable cover and And a and a banana . 
UNKNOWN It is possible , but , well if it I dunno . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN I dunno how to how to do it if if t if to if it's better to put the solar cell to the t to the peeling or outside it , or or inside . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But then it must be some window there , you know . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN And something we forgot , maybe , uh about the speech recognition system , are we going to use it , or not ? 
UNKNOWN Yes , I think . 
UNKNOWN I think it's important . 
UNKNOWN I think so . 
UNKNOWN It i Yeah , it seems feasible , and it would be something very great . 
UNKNOWN I think One of our p priorities is tech technology . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN And Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So we have the de design , the a good shape , new and so on , and we have also the technology thing w will be . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN And even the easy to use thing , so it will be perfect . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN So we add also the speech recognition device . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I agree . 
UNKNOWN So , that great . 
UNKNOWN We have decided everything . 
UNKNOWN And think we are on a good way . 
UNKNOWN So , um uh the next meeting will start in thirty minutes . 
UNKNOWN Um , so uh the the Industrial Manager uh will uh will work on the look and feel design . 
UNKNOWN The User Interface uh uh Mana uh Manager will work on the user interface device . 
UNKNOWN And the the Marketing Expert will do the first project evaluation . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So , I hope you can do that in thirty minutes . 
UNKNOWN And uh , yeah , I uh I think you should work together , s you uh Hamed and Peter , to work uh in a in a first prototype , and uh more about the shape and so on and how you can manage to put everything together . 
UNKNOWN And um as usual you will receive some specific instructions on . 
UNKNOWN So thank you all everybody , and see you in thirty minutes . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
THANKS Thank you . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
THANKS Thank you . 
UNKNOWN Oops . 
UNKNOWN So , hello everyone . 
UNKNOWN We're here to have a kick-off meeting for the design of a f for the beginning of new project um uh remote control for the design for a new remote control . 
UNKNOWN I'm the Project Manager Christa Pavlov and okay let's begin . 
UNKNOWN So I'm first going to do an opening then we get used to one anothers and we speak about this tool we're going to design and try to make a project plan , some discussion and then we talk of uh the next meeting . 
UNKNOWN So um we want to to do a new remote control . 
UNKNOWN It has to be original , trendy and user friendly . 
UNKNOWN Um I think the important points we have to t talk about are uh it's functional design , it's conceptual design , and desail detailed design . 
UNKNOWN and for that we're going um all to work individually and then have meeting during the whole day . 
UNKNOWN Um , so let's try the whiteboard . 
UNKNOWN Wow . 
UNKNOWN Um so any of you who want to go . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , for favourite animals . 
UNKNOWN It's gonna be not my favourite one but the one I can draw. 
UNKNOWN And it's gonna be you'll try to guess . 
UNKNOWN Wow . 
UNKNOWN Wow . 
UNKNOWN Complex . 
UNKNOWN Huh ? 
UNKNOWN A cat . 
NEGATION No . 
NEGATION No . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN Darn . 
CONFUSION Uh . 
UNKNOWN A rabbit . 
UNKNOWN Yes , that's a rabbit . 
UNKNOWN A what ? 
UNKNOWN That's my favourite one . 
UNKNOWN A rabbit . 
UNKNOWN A r a rabbit , oh oh yeah , where is the carrot ? 
UNKNOWN Rabbit . 
UNKNOWN Okay mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN That's it . 
UNKNOWN You want to go ? 
UNKNOWN I am not very good at uh this kind of stuff . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN My favourite animal is Guess . 
UNKNOWN Wow . 
UNKNOWN You wa Is the white okay . 
UNKNOWN A human ah . 
UNKNOWN A human , yay . 
UNKNOWN It's a very complex animal and um yeah . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN Characteristics of this this animal is dangerous . 
UNKNOWN Mm I think you're supposed to , yeah . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN I guess you can . 
UNKNOWN Wow . 
UNKNOWN That's cobra . 
UNKNOWN Ah , a kind of uh snake ? 
UNKNOWN Cobra ? 
UNKNOWN Exactly . 
UNKNOWN Yeah uh not really . 
UNKNOWN Small cobra . 
UNKNOWN No , it just small cobra , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh-huh . 
UNKNOWN Is that a worm ? 
UNKNOWN It's co c quite recognisable . 
UNKNOWN Or Uh yeah Christa Pavlov Mm . 
UNKNOWN What about you uh Christa ? 
UNKNOWN Chris . 
UNKNOWN Christa Christa . 
UNKNOWN A fish . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Smiling fish . 
UNKNOWN Smile fish . 
UNKNOWN A smiling fish . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So , w whiteboard is working ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Good . 
UNKNOWN Next . 
UNKNOWN Next . 
UNKNOWN Let's talk about money . 
UNKNOWN Just tr try to guess who is a User Interface Designer . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , well . 
UNKNOWN According to the drawings . 
UNKNOWN Not me . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , you're Hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So . 
UNKNOWN So . 
UNKNOWN Twenty five Euro for a remote control . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , mm that's the price we want to that's the aim for the price for the remote control . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN We aim to do this profit . 
UNKNOWN 'tis big number . 
UNKNOWN On the international market . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , we're to sell two million then . 
UNKNOWN Wow . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Mm for a production cost of mm twelve fifty Euros maximum . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN So any of you have experience in remote controls ? 
UNKNOWN Uh yes , we have plenty at home . 
UNKNOWN Mm yeah . 
UNKNOWN In fact , my daughter likes l remote controls . 
UNKNOWN That So that could be a great um application . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN To eat ? 
UNKNOWN To eat ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , mainly , and to break . 
UNKNOWN Remote controls children proof . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Mm mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Ye ye yeah . 
UNKNOWN Children proof . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN So she likes uh buttons which make click , so it has to click . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , pret Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So they have to be waterproof maybe ? 
UNKNOWN It has to be uh wha baby proof yeah but mainly it has to be very robust because even if she's not very tall she's uh high enough so that uh when she throw it away it's uh So it has to be very robust . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause they eat she ate it . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Ah . 
UNKNOWN Okay , unbreakable . 
UNKNOWN Unbreakable , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh-huh . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , we have some child lock or something , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN And uh it has to be nice looking , colourful , maybe colourful , because uh nobody has colourful remote control , they're always black , yeah , but this one could be I dunno , purple or b Yeah , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Colourful , yeah mm . 
UNKNOWN Colourful ? 
UNKNOWN That's not practical . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN No , that's a good idea . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , it's always black or yeah . 
UNKNOWN Mm mm-mm . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN But how gonna okay , just uh but it's uh monochrome it's n it's not like Otherwise you will never find it . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN No , because you think , why not . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN One colour . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah even we can change colours , no ? 
UNKNOWN Like the uh like the phones and these things we c yeah . 
UNKNOWN Oh like the phones , yeah , it could change colours , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Cool . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN At least for children like one colour and . 
UNKNOWN Ch Yeah , but without any extremes like n not of this size , not too large . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Good . 
UNKNOWN Good idea . 
UNKNOWN And it should be really small and . 
UNKNOWN Small also ? 
UNKNOWN Don't you think No uh , not too much buttons or mm . 
UNKNOWN Huh not so big like yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , not too much buttons and Uh . 
UNKNOWN Should it be , y you know these uh remote controls where um they are what they call a universal ret remote control so y you can decide that now it's the remote control for the television , then it's the remote control for the the sound system , or for your refrigerator whatever I dunno if it's Or if we should have a targeted re remote control . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's Okay . 
UNKNOWN So , I think there's So you you think it's better if small than bigger . 
UNKNOWN So colour , robustness , easy to use , size , yeah , size matters , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Colour , size , sh Yeah , maybe at least n not bigger than this I guess . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN No , not too small , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah yeah , at least it should hold in your hand n properly , like . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , like a palm sized . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Just to hold it . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN But uh what would be different from this , from the others ? 
UNKNOWN I dunno if Yeah , at least the colour would be different . 
UNKNOWN Uh maybe we can change the colours that at least the frame . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN S so then it depends you are to Mm I mean you c you can easily remove the frame . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN I think one thing important for instance in this remote control if you remember when people use it they're they never find a good button in the right place . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN For some reason they they they click the off button when they want to use the So there's a problem in the design of that kind of remote control somehow , I dunno . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN So , some kind of idea uh with um um cellular phone with a a screen that will tell you what no . 
UNKNOWN No , no screens , it's too complex . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Too expensive for twelve Euro ? 
UNKNOWN Too expensive , yeah . 
UNKNOWN And n maybe not too expensive , well it's not my problem , but well okay . 
UNKNOWN And too expensive . 
UNKNOWN Ah . 
UNKNOWN But no screens on remote controls . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN I thought it could be only a screen which would change depending on uh uh the use or even the user . 
UNKNOWN So ma I prefer to have the off button at the top right , so I would have my own design of the remote control because it's in fact just a a full touch screen remote control , if you if you like . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Ye yeah . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN I mean it it's like it's like two types no ? 
UNKNOWN I don't know if it makes sense , but Yeah , for instance , mm . 
UNKNOWN Mm-mm . 
UNKNOWN people are right handed or left handed so y because I am left handed I use like this , say if you're right handed you use like this or so tha your switch on and off should be on yeah . 
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm , mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Mm mm mm . 
UNKNOWN So adaptable yeah something yeah . 
UNKNOWN Adaptable . 
UNKNOWN Maybe , if if it's possible , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Alright , good , so how many actions do we need to implement in it ? 
UNKNOWN Mm huh . 
UNKNOWN Maybe I think even we can keep two switches and then we can uh only make one working . 
UNKNOWN On off ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN We can adapt only one switch , suppose here like we can make two switches and if I'm left-hander I use this switch to follow the main operations . 
UNKNOWN I mean if it's less than three uh then we can make it uh like a like three mental states , yeah you know what I mean , we can just make it uh controlled by a brain , huh ? 
UNKNOWN Two . 
UNKNOWN Three buttons you mean ? 
UNKNOWN Three option . 
UNKNOWN Ah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Um . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm , yeah , sure . 
UNKNOWN Maybe if it's more , if there is a software inside that ask you three Hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN If it if we want a r universal remote control that we sa like we say before it may may need more than three mm three button , three mm possibilities , ye yeah . 
UNKNOWN Sh sure , sure . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , more than three actions that you may want to do at a given time . 
UNKNOWN Mm yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But for standard actions you usually what do you do , you change channels , you adjust volume , and nothing else . 
UNKNOWN Yeah but for instance when you change channels you can have you can just go to the next one or go to channel twenty five . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN And that's already more complex to go to channel twenty five . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN You do this ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh no . 
UNKNOWN I usually just change channels . 
UNKNOWN Because I'm only using three or four channels but And then back to the one I was before , so there's whichever it was . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But they keep generally their t slash slash uh this thing and then the dash dash and then you can put yeah , you can only have one bit . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I change channel like this , m uh I want to go to twenty five , and then to ten , uh-huh mm yeah . 
UNKNOWN Dash . 
UNKNOWN Also we can be here yeah , that would be cool . 
UNKNOWN Uh-huh . 
UNKNOWN Yeah you can yeah . 
UNKNOWN Go back button is good . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh uh we had that in in other countries . 
UNKNOWN I once had it . 
UNKNOWN Yeah yeah , the previous button is . 
UNKNOWN Mm yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah e even the history so you could like uh undo previous of the previous . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Uh , okay . 
UNKNOWN History . 
UNKNOWN Oh uh . 
UNKNOWN Then you can watch what your ah you could also record your record your sequence of actions , that becomes more complex , but you could look at what uh the other people have used there or remote controls . 
CONFUSION Uh . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah yeah , what the which channels the viewer Marketing yeah . 
UNKNOWN Mm-mm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah maybe it's a Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So I think we have full of idea . 
UNKNOWN Um we're going to meet again in thirty minutes and uh I want you to mm work on these ideas and try to make a uh the ones , make um to decide what what are the ones important and what are the one that we don't want . 
UNKNOWN And um m maybe more in the technical parts what uh do we want to do . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN So um your personal coach will send you some instruction for for this thirty minutes. 
UNKNOWN So what does M_E_ means ? 
UNKNOWN M_E_ the user requirements ? 
UNKNOWN Or that's uh that's for us ? 
UNKNOWN Market Expert . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Uh that's me . 
UNKNOWN Oh , of course yeah , the user requirement specifications , uh-huh , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Mm okay . 
UNKNOWN I'll think of that . 
UNKNOWN So . 
UNKNOWN So ? 
UNKNOWN I think that's all . 
UNKNOWN Meeting's over ? 
CONFIRMATION Great . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
THANKS Thank you . 
THANKS Thank you . 
THANKS Thank you everybody . 
UNKNOWN See you in thirty minutes . 
UNKNOWN So I hope you're ready for this uh functional design meeting . 
UNKNOWN So Of course . 
UNKNOWN Um so I will take the minutesyou mm you three are going to do presentation. 
UNKNOWN Um uh we want to know to at the end to know the new project's requirement so we need uh to know the the user uh needs that we want to fulfil to fulfil the from the technical part we want to know how it going to work and um third part uh I don't remember which is not very good . 
UNKNOWN Ah of course , how to to design this uh this yeah . 
UNKNOWN Nice stuff Who starts ? 
UNKNOWN So um let's go for the three presentations, so first um Marketing Expert . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN Ha . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So wait a minute. 
UNKNOWN So I dunno if I can do that like this ? 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah ? 
UNKNOWN So it's being modified . 
UNKNOWN Do you want yeah , open . 
UNKNOWN Read only . 
UNKNOWN I hope I saved it . 
UNKNOWN So , um yeah , this is my name . 
UNKNOWN Sammy Benjo . 
UNKNOWN I know this name uh . 
UNKNOWN Sounds uh Mm uh . 
UNKNOWN We met before . 
UNKNOWN So as you know , you I think you already know me , Sammy Benjo . 
UNKNOWN I am the expert in marketing and I want to tell you about what people uh s want and uh like and dislike in remote controls , and I hope this is going to help you to to design it correctly . 
UNKNOWN So next please . 
SURPRISE Uh-oh . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , it is put F_ five . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN The full pagepresentation, yep . 
UNKNOWN Yeah maybe in the full pagebecause i I spent lots of time doing this presentation, so . 
UNKNOWN F_ F_ five . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN F_ five . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh-huh hmm okay . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN So basically uh what I suggest is that uh instead of deciding ourself what what could be and what should be a good uh remote control , let's ask people who are users of remote controls how they feel about w the current remote controls , what they like , what they don't like and um and what they do with them by the way because they are supposed to be useful . 
UNKNOWN Don't forget about that . 
UNKNOWN So we've we've conducted a a survey on on the use of uh remote controls and I'd like to show you some of the results we found on this survey . 
UNKNOWN And next please . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , so basically what we found was that uh there are several things that the user don't like in remote controls . 
UNKNOWN First of all , they find it very ugly . 
UNKNOWN Current remote controls as you know they're the same as this one uh they're not nice colour , not nice shape , I mean they're all the same , and they're not l good looking . 
UNKNOWN Um what is interesting is that in fact it seems that they were people are ready to pay for nice and look and fancy looking uh remote control , so I think we should probably spend lots of time in and effort in that um . 
UNKNOWN And the other thing is that uh the the current remote controls are not so easy to use and it it the the current uh facilities that they offer do not match what people really want to use their remote controls . 
UNKNOWN For instance uh we see that uh they zap very often so I think this is a very uh important uh functionality that it should be easy for them to to zap uh in one way or another . 
UNKNOWN And most of the buttons uh on uh current remote controls are not used , so I think we should design something where some of the buttons which are those that are used should be easier to see and use than others that only a couple of people are using . 
UNKNOWN Um next please . 
UNKNOWN Now people are very frustrated w with their remote controls and they for instance uh they don't even find it it's it's often lost somewhere in the in the in your home and nobody knows where it is . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Maybe if we have something where we could ask the remote control please , where are you ? 
UNKNOWN Agree . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Like uh something to to like t I think phones . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Some of the phones have some of this kind of s functionality . 
UNKNOWN Uh of course phone you can always phone your phone but you can't phone your your remote control . 
UNKNOWN You can you are . 
UNKNOWN Why not ? 
UNKNOWN But why not ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And because of the fact that there are so many buttons in these remote controls that nobody use , in fact they don't even know how to use them , so most of the the people say they they don't know how to they to use properly their r remote controls . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN And uh they are bad for R_S_I_ but uh I don't remember what is R_S_I_ . 
UNKNOWN So I think they are bad . 
UNKNOWN Okay uh tha that's look great . 
UNKNOWN R_S_I_ mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Mm nobody has any idea about that ? 
UNKNOWN Well I'll check uh with my Oh , okay , I think it's a technical thing which our Okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , it's electromagnetic waves or something kind of maybe uh effect . 
UNKNOWN No , I don't think so . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , because infrared uses some electromagnetic technology , and those waves have high Uh . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So , it seems that it's a lot of people for a concept that we don't know but we have to take this into account . 
UNKNOWN But twenty six percent , do you know Twenty five . 
UNKNOWN Or something we don't know . 
CONFUSION Uh . 
UNKNOWN Every fourth , you know . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah it's People really Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Every four some of us knows . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So anyway that's for what the biggest frustration uh of the user and um what else do I have ? 
UNKNOWN One of us Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Next slide? 
UNKNOWN Ah yeah . 
UNKNOWN So we've listed a couple of uh s uh functions that may be uh used by u the user in the current uh available uh remote controls and uh well the tables look very nice to read but what is important is to understand that the power button is not used often because in general you use it only once per session , but it is very relevant . 
UNKNOWN Functions . 
UNKNOWN People want to have a power button . 
UNKNOWN Channel selection is uh o often used very often used and indeed uh very relevant . 
UNKNOWN Ah now I remember what is R_S_I_ it's repetitivity stress injury . 
UNKNOWN We have to be careful with that word but uh anyway I continue my presentationso yeah , channel selection is um very important , very often used . 
CONFUSION Uh . 
UNKNOWN Volume is not often used but people uh want to have control on volume and that makes sense of course . 
UNKNOWN And n then you have things which are very much less often used like the settings . 
UNKNOWN Audio settings , screen settings , even teletext and channel settings . 
UNKNOWN All of them . 
UNKNOWN they're not often used and they are s more or less relevant . 
UNKNOWN It seems that people find teletext teletext uh relevant , even if I personally never use it but seems that it's average relevant at least , so . 
UNKNOWN I have been told that we uh don't consider teletext , that it's out of date now because of internet . 
UNKNOWN I can tell you that uh in a l in a scale between one and ten relevant uh not relevant to relevant people scored a six on this , which is not as uh these these two one were had I think ten I think . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN But but if you compare with these ones , uh I think they scored a one or two . 
UNKNOWN Not very relevant , so if if there are good reason not to put teletext it's okay but just know that people find it somehow relevant . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm Mm-mm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN That's for the main functions I think and uh then we can ask uh ourself uh what people don't have that may be useful . 
UNKNOWN For instance I think net next slide. 
UNKNOWN One of the thing the trend uh that uh you are probably aware of is the possibility the eventual possibility of having speech recognition in your remote control , so you wouldn't have to tap tap in your buttons but just tell your remote control or whatever you need you have what you want . 
UNKNOWN So we've conducted a survey about uh whether people would like or not to have uh this kind of uh functionality in their remote control and as we can see it really depends on the age . 
UNKNOWN Young people , probably because it's a buzz word , find it very relevant . 
UNKNOWN And uh as the age goes up the the relevance goes down . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So now it really depends on the kind of uh targeting uh wha who are we targeting with this remote control ? 
UNKNOWN I think if we are targeting young people then uh it's probably something we have to consider . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause Thank you . 
UNKNOWN If we are targeting you very old people this is something they really don't know why they this should be so now this is of course , depends on that . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN And um I don't have any conclusion , I didn't have time the meeting was very tight , so that's basically my findings . 
UNKNOWN And uh , if you have any question ? 
UNKNOWN Mm I think it's good , okay . 
UNKNOWN You done a good review . 
UNKNOWN I got one question , uh you are a Market Expert so should we aim at the young people or not ? 
UNKNOWN I can go back . 
UNKNOWN Yeah one question , yeah ? 
UNKNOWN I am . 
UNKNOWN I think we should aim at the young people . 
UNKNOWN But uh I think they are they are those uh who might be more interested in a in a new device . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN In general the the early adopters of a new device are young people , less than more than Then teletext is useless for them I think , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay , then teletext is used less . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Because they they have other means of finding their information . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm mm mm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN But yeah . 
UNKNOWN That's good point . 
UNKNOWN Mm , yep . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Nope . 
UNKNOWN 'Kay ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
THANKS Thank you . 
UNKNOWN So um now I think it's the turn of the the I'm not sure um Of the technical function , so uh what effect Okay . 
UNKNOWN So I think it's you , huh ? 
UNKNOWN Uh it's techni function of Yeah . 
UNKNOWN No ? 
UNKNOWN That's me . 
UNKNOWN No , user requiremen Makes sense . 
UNKNOWN Wait a second . 
UNKNOWN I have to do working design so uh . 
UNKNOWN Argh . 
UNKNOWN So you're Okay . 
UNKNOWN That's but this but number three , yes . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So , my name is Mark Dwight , and um I am responsible for User Interface Design . 
UNKNOWN However , uh mm Project Manager asked me to give you some presentationabout technical functions design . 
UNKNOWN Uh , as I'm a more an artist that's gonna be less technical functions but more User Interface and current intentions and everything which is linked with this . 
UNKNOWN So next slideplease . 
UNKNOWN Let's go . 
UNKNOWN And uh a general method which is seems to be very useful for our task is not to forget about uh Occam razor . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN We should never complicate things too much . 
UNKNOWN We should only make a remote control , nothing more . 
UNKNOWN Nothing more than this , just a remote control . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause current remote controls they are never easy enough to use . 
UNKNOWN So , make a click , please . 
UNKNOWN So here is this remote control . 
UNKNOWN It's quite a standard one , but it's not from a T_V_ , it's from a much easier device like air conditioning or something . 
UNKNOWN But you know , we can use it for a T_V_ easily . 
UNKNOWN Only buttons we need is on off , volume , channels and maybe some options or something else , and please make a click , compared to this one which one would you prefer ? 
UNKNOWN It's Yeah , yeah . 
UNKNOWN I guess this . 
UNKNOWN I would say the simplest one as long as there are the uh I find the buttons that I need every time I need a button . 
UNKNOWN Sure , sure . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Maybe it can be yeah middle of like , between those two li S you should yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , and our method is going to be , provide simple simple desires into simple actions . 
UNKNOWN Oh sorry . 
UNKNOWN Nice . 
UNKNOWN Nice sentence . 
UNKNOWN Findings . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Oh sorry . 
UNKNOWN Our question of the style , we should remember that our company puts fashion into electronics and we should never forget about it . 
UNKNOWN Concept . 
UNKNOWN Be simple . 
UNKNOWN Be simple and you'll lean on this market . 
UNKNOWN Market is a of remote controls you know it better , it's very well , it's it's not an easy field to to play , you know ? 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN So be simple . 
UNKNOWN For personal preferences I think that to make a baby-proof remote control it got to be a titanium . 
UNKNOWN It's a really good style , it going to be look like like this . 
UNKNOWN It is unbreakable and it is very universal . 
UNKNOWN W we'll have a screen with a back light which can change colours , and we can put all the options into this screen . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN We'll need only few buttons . 
UNKNOWN All the other things can be controlled through the screen . 
UNKNOWN And all these buttons should be easy to find and to click , 'cause when you watch a movie and you want to change something , you always try to find a good button and click it , but you should do it by touching it and finding it easily just by touch . 
UNKNOWN So Press I would propose this concept for design , just few buttons , a screen with a back light which can change colours , titanium I think , and uh what else ? 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN I got just very few and good ideas . 
UNKNOWN We need power and volume . 
UNKNOWN And let us include two nice features into this device , first , power on and off can be made fully automatic . 
UNKNOWN When you go to the sofa , take your control and point it to the T_V_ , the T_V_ turns on . 
UNKNOWN It's off . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN It's on . 
UNKNOWN And when does it turn off ? 
UNKNOWN When you don't touch the control but you go out of the For for enough time like uh you It's a question to our technical design , our two engineers . 
UNKNOWN Oh so you have a sensing sensor machine that uh knows Tech Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN And another nice feature that I would like to implement is uh volume control . 
UNKNOWN Suppose you set u you set up some volume and then you move out or you move to the other corner of the room and take your control with you . 
UNKNOWN Like , you want to to change the chair or you want to move to the armchair from the sofa or something , and then the volume changes . 
UNKNOWN Or you want to go to the kitchen . 
UNKNOWN It's easy to do , you just control the According to the distance . 
UNKNOWN According to your distance to and the angle maybe , if you have a stereo system . 
UNKNOWN Distance . 
UNKNOWN Yeah yeah yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh I'm not sure about the screen , wha what is the use usefulness of the screen ? 
UNKNOWN So I think it can be just a menu which can be controlled with a left , right , up , down and enter . 
UNKNOWN Uh is it a touch screen by the way ? 
UNKNOWN So it gives instructions but uh it has to be with an back light somehow . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So , its main purpose in fact is a back light , which change colours , which makes it easier to find , and each can it can respond for your voice , like it can turn on the light for you just to f find it easily , yeah ? 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN So basically that's it . 
UNKNOWN Um I see that you target uh several s application not only T_V_ but i like we talk about um universal uh remote control . 
UNKNOWN Can be easily done , 'cause you got simple designs, y we should put it to simple actions . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Let it be universal , so you want to use it for your hi-fi system . 
UNKNOWN You want to change tracks and you want to adjust volume . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Just few actions , a few actions for everything . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN S Mm . 
UNKNOWN All the rest , we sh we'll put it into this menu on the screen . 
UNKNOWN Since we were targeting a really soon uh uh date for the the the um i issuing of this uh remote control I think we will only concentrate on T_V_ for the moment and then maybe m make it more generalised yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Okay , okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah and it mm . 
UNKNOWN Okay , but it's quite universal you know . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN We can just extend it to any device . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN So for instance if I want to go to directly to channel twenty five , how would I do can I do that with this ? 
UNKNOWN Uh twenty five . 
UNKNOWN Yeah mm let's say I am uh on channel eight now . 
UNKNOWN You know these days we have hundreds of channels , that's not so easy to go just next next next when you have hundreds of channels . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN In fact I would propose another solution . 
UNKNOWN Or is it ? 
UNKNOWN Basically you use just four or five channels , right ? 
UNKNOWN Most people yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So uh set up your T_V_ set like channels that you use they're one , two , three and five , and you will never have to go to a twenty fives channel . 
UNKNOWN In fact in in one uh remote control that I've seen , instead of doing that d you could just say these are the cha ch channel three , twenty eight , forty eight and uh sixty four are those that I want to by cycled with my next button . 
UNKNOWN Yeah it's it's the same solution , I think . 
UNKNOWN I uh B yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN But even we can have some uh L_C_D_ display , like you can uh de you can just button the number and then it go t because Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Go to channel twenty five . 
UNKNOWN One thing is that as I said in my presentationpeople really do like to z zap . 
UNKNOWN So even if they are only watching four or five channels , I think they want to zap out of the one hundred channels , just because this is one kind of thing they do , zapping . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN But still Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah uh on zap it's only next next next next next , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And it's only next . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah so but you have to Okay . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN We got these buttons here . 
UNKNOWN Next next . 
UNKNOWN Yeah. . 
UNKNOWN Or say this can be back . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But otherwise like we can put some display on numbers and then they can just press suppose two five they just press two and five and then Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So it would be Okay . 
UNKNOWN Maybe we can make uh different modes for each button and you can change mode zapping mode or uh current chan Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah but since we are focusing only on T_V_ remote controls so we can have more functions for T_V_ uh if you want to go for a universal then we ought to limit for functions for each of our devices . 
UNKNOWN Listening more . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Could we carry out some research if we w really need this , like how many people really need to go to channel number twenty five and then to sixty four ? 
UNKNOWN Well I could could uh have a look at that maybe . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN I'll check in my department if there's someone specialist in that . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Although I don't know . 
UNKNOWN Alright ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Thanks for your attention . 
UNKNOWN Uh you're finish ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So now the technical aspects of this new device . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Two . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , if Sorry . 
UNKNOWN You prefer it . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh as you know , I am mister Ramaro . 
UNKNOWN I am an expert in uh industrial design of all electronic devices and I previously devised many uh like digital calculators and electronic calculators . 
UNKNOWN So now I'll briefly describe the working design of our remote control . 
UNKNOWN Well , as you know the basic function of remote control is sending some message to the the device , like T_V_ or V_C_R_ or D_V_D_ player etcetera . 
UNKNOWN So we will have a p portable device which will send message to the the main device like T_V_ . 
UNKNOWN So we need to have some energy source to do what to do the functions , what we want on this portable device . 
UNKNOWN And usually this so to do these functions we need an interface , which basically some kind of pressing buttons or keys or like moving jack or something like that . 
UNKNOWN And then these messages these key buttons can be transferred into some kind of message and then it will process by the chip and then it will generate some information to the main device . 
UNKNOWN It's generally in the form of infrared or some kind of s sensor information . 
UNKNOWN Then we will have the main control in the main device to do the particular action what we want . 
UNKNOWN So , basically we need uh since we are focusing on our interface device remote control we need few components , mainly the energy source like the battery and then we have user interface like uh the keypad and you know buttons we want , and then we have some chip , it's mainly digital signal processing chip because since we are I am one doing mostly digital uh devices we ought to have some kind of processor which take care of all these functions and put it in some digital format . 
UNKNOWN And then we'll have the infrared L_E_D_ source which sends the information to the main device . 
UNKNOWN Then we'll have switch in our main uh um device to do particular operations , and we ought to do different codes for different T_V_s , so some T_V_s will have different encryption codes for doing s s uh channel changing and these things . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN To make it quite uh an universal uh device uh . 
UNKNOWN Yeah yeah , because the people don't use one particular brand so or at least we have more more than five brands , which are really good . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So we need to check their specifications and do their uh encryption that's passing information to the T_V_ device . 
UNKNOWN So we need to have particular encryption codes . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Then , components , so we have the main uh energy source and then we will have some buttons and then we will have infrared uh source and then we have some inside some chip in in the device . 
UNKNOWN Uh since I don't have much time so I'll input the connections to all this components . 
UNKNOWN And since I also want to know feedback from our Marketing Expert and User Interface , so if you want to add some more components we can incorporate them . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN And from from the discussion we had do you can you make it on the whiteboard , or mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I'm sure , because since our User Interface speech recognition and also Marketing Expert for the speech recognition is really handy , so we can have another , like uh s simple speech recogniser on our D_S_B_ chip . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Since we have some kind of uh energy this is our this normal battery , so this battery , once you s switch on it will take power and we can have some speech recognition and in our g generally small digital signal processing chip so that and we will put uh the small uh simple speech recogniser and we can also train the speech recogniser for particular user so you just yeah , so that we just use simple recog no but but Yeah . 
UNKNOWN On Uh train it , okay . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Too complex . 
UNKNOWN But uh very very good to sell . 
UNKNOWN No , even in you can find even simple mobile device like any mobile brand you can have these voice dialers or these things , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Think of a all these young people who would love to say that this remote control only works for them , and ha ha you cannot use my remote control , because it's targeted to me . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Whatever . 
UNKNOWN And what about the price of this component ? 
UNKNOWN So Uh maybe we can make uh it in five Euros and even less than that , because we want to have uh millions and in bulk , so we can make really simp and we want to make really simple device because we have only very few words like like power , switch on or some like then we'll have something like this um we'll have volume and then we will have s particular channel , so users can listen . 
UNKNOWN It mm okay . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Cheap . 
UNKNOWN Millions . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Cheap . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN The user uh will just be able to say uh please can you uh pump up the vo pump up the volume or or it will be something like volume , up , down . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Ye No , yeah , a user can use any kind of sender but they should have this prompt volume and then yeah volume and decrease or increase , so we try to only recognise those words and and because we can't really say user to say same wording then it become more mechanical and yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN With a keywords and yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Couple of words . 
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm mm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN And then we can have channel they can say , okay I want eight , because we don't know like users have different programmes , I mean they don't really follow same channels strict uh so we just want channel number , we don't want like B_B_C_ or C_N_N_ or something else because it will be complicated so we'll have only these three uh main basic uh anyway volume is not really speech recognition problem , it's it it will be take care of our main mm . 
UNKNOWN Of course uh it has to be Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN No you know it's a conceptual question , 'cause now I see th this the picture in front of my eyes like a user taking his remote control and shouting into it , volume up , volume up , and and he's coming you know , he's really annoyed with this , down , up , down . 
UNKNOWN But then I think you you First of all I I think this is not uh functionality that it is going to be instead of using the buttons . 
UNKNOWN No , in no not only speech , yeah . 
UNKNOWN It's on top of using the button . 
UNKNOWN Okay , for this budget like twelve Euros . 
UNKNOWN I it's an option . 
UNKNOWN Well , I dunno . 
UNKNOWN Yeah actually we we can have one switch to like uh switch on , on and off , this processor and This really , suppose like here we have our main chip which controls power , volume and this part and this D_S_P_s . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Again , this to have some interaction like suppose people use D_S_P_ then it particularly sends some information to the chip like in some form , like volume and like this key . 
UNKNOWN So it may not be like very expensive , because since we are only focusing on T_V_ remote control so and we have only few things here Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay. . 
UNKNOWN T_V_ . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm , mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Sho to to train , okay . 
UNKNOWN Did you consider the r gest uh gesture recognition ? 
UNKNOWN Like , if I want to put volume up I like do mm I take my remote control do like something like roll 'em up or roll 'em down . 
UNKNOWN Um uh uh this point we didn't consider because it's it's very expensive because v our target is only like twelve point five Euros and Yeah , even automatic on off is also a bit problematic , because it different criteria for different people like so suppose people are really uh they just uh they don't touch the remote and mm y you don't know how much time you need to switch on or switch off and Yay yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Very expensive , no ? 
UNKNOWN And well , what about the idea of automatic on off on the button , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Mm why ? 
UNKNOWN That's just We got a really good Market Expert . 
UNKNOWN And volume control . 
UNKNOWN So but uh Sh should we target a a user personalised uh uh remote control ? 
UNKNOWN So in in a given room there might be more than one remote control . 
UNKNOWN We would uh have each one and uh with our own personal uh settings . 
UNKNOWN Yeah that can be possible , especially for power settings , so user can say okay , suppose they're watching a tennis match or something then they can say okay uh after one hour I They can make Yeah we can have Yeah . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Wouldn't that make uh arguments ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , of course . 
UNKNOWN I want uh And we can increase this the strength y you can buy one with Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN That's no problem , we will sell more . 
UNKNOWN Yeah exactly . 
UNKNOWN Let's send more , let's sell more . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN You have mm something else to say ? 
UNKNOWN Uh , not very much , like yeah . 
CONFUSION Uh . 
NEGATION No . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Thanks . 
UNKNOWN Okay , thanks . 
THANKS Thank you . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
THANKS Thank you . 
UNKNOWN So mm mm I think , okay , we're just on time . 
UNKNOWN Can you just yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um mm mm . 
UNKNOWN So , we're now going to l have the lunch break . 
UNKNOWN Mm great . 
UNKNOWN Then we will work again for thirty minutes individual work , and um we will uh meet again for the next meeting , and uh in this one want to to be more focused on the individual actions the um on the components so uh you will focus on the component concept um uh of course the U_I_D_ Mark will be uh focused on the user interface concept and uh our m Market Expert Sammy Benjo uh on the trend watching . 
UNKNOWN Yeah yeah . 
UNKNOWN Mark will Uh it's in current price , yeah . 
UNKNOWN So um of course like before specific instruction will be sent to you by your personal personal coach . 
UNKNOWN Well I think that's all . 
UNKNOWN And we have um maybe we have to we say , only for T_V_ , not teletext ? 
UNKNOWN Uh I think automatic on off control uh it's not possible . 
UNKNOWN Difficult . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , maybe in the next uh step if we make it work um . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But speech recogniser can be possible . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , implemented . 
UNKNOWN O okay , we can think about that . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN And um do you see something else ? 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN Uh , should it be equipped with the uh , with uh speakers ? 
UNKNOWN Speakers in the remote cont Oh yeah . 
UNKNOWN Like , you want to find it , you shout control , and it answers is I'm here ? 
UNKNOWN Uh yeah that's Or maybe you want to phone him . 
UNKNOWN Or Just beeps ? 
UNKNOWN It just beeps . 
UNKNOWN That would be enough . 
UNKNOWN Something very cheap . 
UNKNOWN But that's ex that's expensive . 
UNKNOWN Yeah yeah yeah . 
UNKNOWN Since now all yeah ? 
CONFUSION Uh . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , especially the power , it really consumes because it should be all the time on and Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Think Uh-huh . 
UNKNOWN Well I I heard of devices where you just uh whistle them and and they because of the the frequency they they just answer to that . 
UNKNOWN And uh And it's answered . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I can't whistle . 
UNKNOWN No , no , I can't . 
UNKNOWN You can't whistle . 
UNKNOWN Uh-huh . 
UNKNOWN Or a clap . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Clap clap clap it's a good I I think it's universal . 
UNKNOWN You can clap . 
UNKNOWN Can you ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Clap is good . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Tak Just a suggestion . 
UNKNOWN What about people without hand ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN With only one hand ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah I think it's good . 
UNKNOWN These are not our target people . 
UNKNOWN Mm uh okay . 
UNKNOWN But it's a good feature I guess yeah we need to think about more how to incorporate it . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Just don't interfere with other devices like 'cause like all these people do that their lights are turning on with clapping . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Oh that's e that already exists okay okay . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN Yeah , I got it at my home , like . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Oh yeah , you do have . 
UNKNOWN Oops . 
UNKNOWN Wow . 
UNKNOWN Ah it's Yeah . 
UNKNOWN You're trendy . 
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm , so let's to think s so that yeah . 
UNKNOWN Think about it . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , okay . 
UNKNOWN I think that could be in the component uh concept uh . 
UNKNOWN It yes . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Good we're done ? 
UNKNOWN So , yeah , let's go to lunch . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Right , thanks . 
THANKS Thank you , thank you very much . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so now we are on the conceptual design meeting . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Uh y getting close to the last is the penultim meeting . 
UNKNOWN How was lunch ? 
UNKNOWN Mm great . 
UNKNOWN Thanks Don't be sarcastic . 
UNKNOWN Mark . 
UNKNOWN So um I will again do the secretary part uh we will have three presentationfirst um uh the industrial design , first Rama then Mark and then Sammy . 
UNKNOWN Uh Rama . 
UNKNOWN Ramaro . 
UNKNOWN Um um we have to take a decision on the control remote control concepts and we have forty minutes . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN So what we want to the decision we want to take on this meeting are on the um first on the component concept , so what kind of energy we use uh what kind of chip on printand one ki kind of case . 
UNKNOWN And also on user interface concept uh what kind of interface we use and if there is some supplements . 
UNKNOWN And at the end um Sammy will give um a trend watching on what he's he's been doing . 
UNKNOWN It's So , let's go . 
UNKNOWN First with Rama . 
UNKNOWN Participant two . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , participant two . 
UNKNOWN Component . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN So we're to mainly design f mainly need to know which components we'll use for energy , and the material and interface . 
UNKNOWN For energy there are maybe two or three possibilities . 
UNKNOWN First one , we can use simple battery , or we can use traditional solar cells or mm and the material we can have plastic , rubber which is good for this R_S_A_ and then uh titanium , which can be which have very good look an and then interface we're to use push buttons or liquid crystal d L_C_D_ display . 
UNKNOWN Ah . 
UNKNOWN And we can use some , moving kind of thing . 
UNKNOWN So , as we discussed before , we need to we would like to have some speech recognition s chip in our remote control . 
UNKNOWN So this can be simple kind of programmable chip and which can use microphone sensors . 
UNKNOWN And we also want to look at our remote control , so . 
UNKNOWN Still we are looking for possible uh technical uh specifications and how w easy we can do and within our pri range , like we're to in our twelve Euros or around that . 
UNKNOWN So we are looking for simple devices or simple technology to do the location of remote control in a room or in a house . 
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm , okay . 
UNKNOWN So uh we discussed an Excuse me . 
UNKNOWN So we would like to propose battery instead of solar cells and it would be problematic uh to have enough energy with the solar cells and so we would like to just use simple battery . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN And also we want to go for titanium design instead of rubber or and well the problem is with this design we found that we can't use double-curved shapes . 
UNKNOWN What is a double-curved shape ? 
UNKNOWN Like you can have two curves . 
UNKNOWN Uh-huh . 
UNKNOWN Why ? 
UNKNOWN Uh it's I think in manufacturing I guess it's problematic . 
UNKNOWN So , we want to go for simple push buttons because it need a simple chip and it's really lesser uh re really less expensive compared to L_C_D_ which are uh which needs advanced chip technology and it's more expensive , since we want to put some other features such as speech recognition we want to reduce uh cost . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN The cost . 
UNKNOWN Um I want to know why it b uh just uh sorry but for the point before uh why not the rubber , if it is something that it seems to be light . 
UNKNOWN Uh Uh And also like in if you put a it's be difficult to do all the moulding of buttons and these things and Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN You m titanium it's more uh Yes so mm Uh-huh . 
UNKNOWN W we can use something like you know the whole body's titanium but there are some rubber or I dunno some rubber parts like to make it feel better and to you know Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Mm like this ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Like in cell phones recently these you can with the rubber in four directions and yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN But full assembly We'll use mainly for titanium rubber is expensive and also it's bit difficult to do all the shapes uh . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN And this push buttons we we would like to use push buttons instead of L_C_D_s and so we want to mo I mean we're we want to put speech recognition so we want to reduce price on this technology and so that we can have enough space or enough money for S S Y yeah we have simple buttons and speech recognition technology , so Uh l So uh it's like a Yeah maybe maybe we can see depending on how we'll come up with our full design then if we have enough money or like for and because the speech recognition technology will take at least five Euros or or something so we want to reduce the cost on display or this inter Ok Yeah , that can we we can consider , because like it won't take much money I guess , because Okay , yep . 
UNKNOWN Uh yeah so Okay , s so simple button and uh speech recognition for the more complicated . 
UNKNOWN Speech L_C_D_ . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Okay , and still we have mm can we still include the L_ L_S_D_ display ? 
UNKNOWN L_C_D_ yeah L_C_D_ . 
UNKNOWN Seems not , it's either L_C_D_ or push-button . 
UNKNOWN No , it's not gonna be a t no touchable but still like a source of information or source for menus . 
UNKNOWN Ah . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so let's try it , let's t Yeah , yeah , it's it's not gonna be a touch pad , uh just a display for giving you information . 
UNKNOWN The L_C_D_ would The display would only be display and not uh touch sensitive you mean . 
UNKNOWN Just uh for output , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN You have any further questions or ? 
UNKNOWN I guess no um . 
UNKNOWN So the batteries uh are going to be very light . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , we're to go for li and now I think we have many options in the market so we can go for small nickel or alkaline batteries for really light batteries and with uh good price . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So this device on n that can be used for speech recognition could also be used for just uh the finding it basically , instead of clapping why not just be ask . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's then the the one thing we want to know is like because remote control is used for like in the household so it it it will be it m maybe at least five , six people want to use it so so how to uh uh how to define our re speech recognition whether we want to do s speaker independent or speaker dependent . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN If we're going for more speaker independent then it would be like again cumbersome and we need really m more technology and so Yeah , if if everybody in the house n to locate then we're to go for some speaker independent technology or something . 
UNKNOWN Okay , for the location . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So let's now go to the you don't have more question ? 
UNKNOWN No , it's okay . 
UNKNOWN No more questions . 
UNKNOWN Um mm thank you mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
THANKS Thank you . 
UNKNOWN Puts less of constraint on what we can do but it's always like that . 
UNKNOWN Mm yeah , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN We have dreams and the in the end we find out that it's not feasible . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but mm . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN Anyway . 
UNKNOWN We have uh some limitations . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But still uh L_S_D_'s already quite nice , L_C_ I'm an artist , sorry . 
UNKNOWN L_C_D_ . 
UNKNOWN L_S_D_ is something else , and it's quite nice as well . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So , go on uh artist . 
UNKNOWN So uh , that's not I hope that's not too much . 
UNKNOWN Um yeah . 
UNKNOWN Now let's talk about uh interface . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Uh participant number three . 
UNKNOWN Three . 
UNKNOWN Three . 
UNKNOWN Uh mm mm uh have a look at this no it's yeah . 
UNKNOWN Which one ? 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Uh so the concept of the interface . 
UNKNOWN Generally I developed quite a broad concept not only for the interface , but for possible instruction or user's manual and uh all the complex things that come together with your T_V_ and remote controls . 
UNKNOWN So let's start with this . 
UNKNOWN We got our perfect remote control with a lot of buttons and uh we got explanation for every button and you can use your time and uh it will take i some days to learn all this buttons and um the L_C_D_ is going to be somewhere here and uh go back button , I don't know really where it is , maybe one of this buttons , and um power on and off mm I I don't remember so uh it it it should be maybe this button is power on and off ? 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Or no ? 
UNKNOWN I can see nothing . 
UNKNOWN So that's our concept . 
UNKNOWN It's called the millennium remote control . 
UNKNOWN Let's change millenniums . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So maybe you can use in the end and Uh Mm . 
UNKNOWN doesn't make sense . 
UNKNOWN This is very ugly . 
UNKNOWN Really ? 
UNKNOWN I thought you like it . 
UNKNOWN Oh no , too much concept . 
UNKNOWN Ah okay just press the button , please uh . 
UNKNOWN Ah . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , we will not use this . 
UNKNOWN We will not use this . 
UNKNOWN But instead of this I will devise That's our concept . 
UNKNOWN Ah , back today . 
UNKNOWN And it's got just few buttons , quite low looking , and all this stuff we already we already discussed . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN And uh what will people say ? 
UNKNOWN They'll say it's perfect . 
UNKNOWN Or what will say ? 
UNKNOWN Uh they will say it's splendid . 
UNKNOWN And uh e everyone will say I'll buy it . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN And everyone's gonna be satisfied . 
UNKNOWN Do you think it can come in several colours ? 
UNKNOWN Or did the Um but not the case . 
UNKNOWN I would make a backlight of the L_C_D_ screen with different colours . 
UNKNOWN Not the case . 
UNKNOWN Uh the case would only be in that uh aluminium uh titanium stuff , like Yeah , well they like uh something which is uh Mm yeah , okay , so that would be the option . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Because apparently from your survey people like colours , no ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so let's remember there's a Nokia phone which changeable panels . 
UNKNOWN Do you like it ? 
UNKNOWN I don't know I don't have a Nokia phone , but I don't use that but again , uh I might Yeah , bu but Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN But it's uh But it would be expensive , no ? 
UNKNOWN That's why you don't have it . 
UNKNOWN That's why , 'cause it's nasty . 
UNKNOWN If you use colour L_C_D_ . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN Uh instead of that maybe we can change the colour of the assembler . 
UNKNOWN Maybe we can just if users want more colours they can pay more money to get this uh the shapes and they can have different assembly . 
UNKNOWN Um , I am here . 
UNKNOWN So users have different I mean they have their own interests , colour interests and so So we can just if they want they can just pay another two Euro . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So ? 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Uh-huh , okay , so you you propose something with option i that increase the price if we if you want o more colours on L_C_D_ , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah yeah yes . 
UNKNOWN If they want like uh so that we can yeah . 
UNKNOWN Kind of upgradable uh remote control . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Wow , wow . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Just they'll get few more things and few more colours . 
UNKNOWN Okay , what uh there's one more decisi uh one more solution in fact , um 'cause there are some some paints that can change colour according to where they are , like they can reflect different colours depending on what is around , like what colour is around , and depending on the temperature , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Lights , yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN And thermodynamic also . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Like a chameleon . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah yeah . 
UNKNOWN We can make it in fact . 
UNKNOWN Yeah but that's maybe mo too much expensive , yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN If if if the okay . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN But uh it can be in uh maybe in an a gradable version , but Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm , mm-hmm , so Uh-huh . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Because uh I think there are two kinds of people . 
UNKNOWN Those for which the remote control is uh is to be uh something useful uh I'm going to talk about this later but and those for which is something that that that uh is uh specific to them so it it's like a signature . 
UNKNOWN My remote control is pink . 
UNKNOWN Nobody else than me has a pink remote control . 
UNKNOWN And that makes me special . 
UNKNOWN Okay and you think that we don't have to make to make them pay more because of uh o or this is Okay , so so i it's not uh a s base service it's a Mm . 
UNKNOWN I think I think they would be ready p ready to pay more for that . 
UNKNOWN Those who wanted to have it pink . 
UNKNOWN Uh Mm . 
UNKNOWN No mm no . 
UNKNOWN So , be an option , yeah . 
UNKNOWN It might be optional , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN But those people will be really few , no ? 
UNKNOWN So like we can those Ah . 
UNKNOWN The the young people the young people want to be different from their friends . 
UNKNOWN Although similar but have something just slightly better . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Pink Mm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN So m so maybe that's if that it's a selling point maybe it has to be the base . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But you know if you want to be different you just take your remote control with you all the time . 
UNKNOWN And it makes you different , you know ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah . 
UNKNOWN And you'll be different . 
UNKNOWN You always have your remote . 
UNKNOWN Uh in the train uh , hello uh no . 
UNKNOWN Oh , you don't ? 
UNKNOWN Anyone has their remote controls here ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN You don't have your remo Wh you you know like for instance take the iPod . 
UNKNOWN No ? 
UNKNOWN Want to change my neighbour . 
UNKNOWN It's a kind of remote control . 
UNKNOWN Uh it's white and it's so white that you see it from any anywhere . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN It has this distinctive look and feel and look which people seems to like just because it's a colour that we don't usually see in a remote control . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN White . 
UNKNOWN Uh-huh , uh-huh . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Could we integrate something into our remote control , something like light ? 
UNKNOWN Seems important . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN That they can use it in darkness , like . 
UNKNOWN Mm glow in the dark , so Okay . 
UNKNOWN Hand light , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah maybe like the infrared like we can put some radium chips or something so that like at least um yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Iradium ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that Oh . 
UNKNOWN Ah sorry . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN S well , let's go on maybe with the presentation. 
UNKNOWN So mm Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh-huh , yeah sure . 
UNKNOWN And um the remote control's going to be smart but how smart should it be to not to complicate things too much ? 
UNKNOWN And uh I dunno that's a question to you and to mm to Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Well so I heard that uh it seems that speech recognition is something that can be done uh so that's the smartness of the thing . 
UNKNOWN Currently we don't have guns with speech recognition or uh beer cans with speech recognition but we may have remote controls with speech recognition . 
UNKNOWN Okay , okay . 
UNKNOWN I dunno . 
UNKNOWN Mm , that's a nice world . 
UNKNOWN So just just just just think about it um . 
UNKNOWN Don't touch the remote . 
THANKS Thank you . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN But yeah . 
UNKNOWN Are are you saying here that uh the remote controls should be aware of who is using it ? 
UNKNOWN So for instance the young guy would not be able to use it because his father doesn't want . 
UNKNOWN Uh yeah I just want to say it should be real smart . 
UNKNOWN Like with some Maybe fingerprint recognition or Mm . 
UNKNOWN Voice recognition is quite tough . 
UNKNOWN I say don't use it , and the control just looks . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause I ordered jus To l to l lock it . 
UNKNOWN Um Mm . 
UNKNOWN Uh that mm that could be feasible I guess , like So since we have we want to do some speaker dependent speech recognition uh so we can use yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So it could be smart in that way . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN But for instance th I I'm thinking about the other uh uh particularity that the the remote control could have . 
UNKNOWN S since it it knows who is using it , it might also record the kind of uh channels you are u more often using and uh levels of volumes that you're more often uh things like that and provide you ways of using them , I dunno , somehow , I dunno , that might be expensive but that might also be a good sales pitch again . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , sure . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Uh it's Hmm . 
UNKNOWN The remote that knows you . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Okay , thanks . 
UNKNOWN So it's yeah , Marketing Expert . 
UNKNOWN My turn ? 
UNKNOWN Okay , it's alright . 
UNKNOWN Participant two ? 
UNKNOWN Four . 
UNKNOWN Four , sorry . 
UNKNOWN Four , I think . 
UNKNOWN Trend , yeah . 
UNKNOWN No uh yes . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so I'm going to talk about trends and um I hope this can help us to to understand l how we should design our remote control . 
UNKNOWN So , next slideplease . 
UNKNOWN So first maybe just a small recap on how how do we watch trends so it's not so uh simple you might think that it's easy but uh it's not so simple . 
UNKNOWN Anyway these days uh the best uh source of information is the web as you know , so have to to go often on the web and look at uh what the others are doing , and ask real people who are using real remote controls every day uh or any other tool that is similar to a remote control which basically is a small device that people have with them , always , like a phone . 
UNKNOWN We can we can use the phone as a as a good uh uh example of where to in be inspired . 
UNKNOWN Of course those tha d who are watching the trends are also have also to be inspired because in fact they're not only watching the trends , they're inventing it , they're creating the trend . 
UNKNOWN I hope I'm going to try to help you on that . 
UNKNOWN This is more risky because you're not following the trend , you try to invent it , which means either you succeed and you make a lot of money or you don't and you're out of business . 
UNKNOWN So anyway uh next slideplease . 
UNKNOWN Uh to be to be quick there's a lot of words here but uh basically there are uh in in the market of of remote controls there are three aspects that we should very pay much attention to . 
UNKNOWN The first one , which seems to be the most important one , is that it has to be fancy , it has to have a fancy look and feel . 
UNKNOWN And uh interestingly this is the very most important thing . 
UNKNOWN It has to be fancy . 
UNKNOWN Strangely enough it's more important to be fancy than to be wi and now that's the second thing it has to be , it has to be technologically i innovative , it has to be new with some of uh new uh technology inside and uh and this is also uh more important than the last thing which we w may think that would have been the most important , which is that it should be easy to use and it should be easy to use as a remote control . 
UNKNOWN So as you see uh it first have to be very nice , s something that people are proud of uh uh that i uh they can be id identified with uh and and then uh something that um contains very novel stuff that they can talk about with their friends , huh , mine has this and not yours . 
UNKNOWN And finally of course it has to be useful as a remote control but it seems that it's not so important that it's useful as a remote control . 
UNKNOWN Next slideplease . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Uh and now in a more uh general uh uh broad way of seeing th uh the thing . 
UNKNOWN If we look back and not uh look at only remote controls I think it's important to see that the trends are quite the same in many areas so currently the the trends that we see in l in l big cities like Paris and Milan , well , it seems that this year things should have uh a fruit and vegetable uh way of of look or feel or so . 
UNKNOWN And I think of course uh i it applies to everything . 
UNKNOWN That's the thing with trends . 
UNKNOWN It it can travel f from clothe to furniture same idea . 
UNKNOWN Fruit and vegetable . 
UNKNOWN Think fruit and vegetable . 
UNKNOWN And uh if we co we compare to last year , now it has to be spongy , yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN What is spongy ? 
UNKNOWN Well this so so I think uh uh i When we were talking about rubber , I think uh the rubber aspect might be important because it's what is probably more feasible in terms of sponginess . 
UNKNOWN Yeah kind of um maybe Yeah it Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN S So maybe titanium it's not a good idea . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Seems not , seems not . 
UNKNOWN We need to think about mm mm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So Think more of uh something in the colours of uh like fruit and vegetables and spongy , as a even in the shape it has to be more round and uh more uh uh look natural somehow . 
UNKNOWN Um sorry Mark . 
UNKNOWN It seems to be Mm-mm . 
UNKNOWN Fruit . 
UNKNOWN Even shape ? 
UNKNOWN More yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I mean And not those futuristic uh remote control with angles and uh and titanium like . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN So that's what people seem to yeah i I know it's quite far from what you thought but that's that's fashion and Okay that's all I have to say . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN You're old-fashioned . 
UNKNOWN Sorry . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Mm you have questions ? 
UNKNOWN So these abilities are mainly ad addressed by young people ? 
UNKNOWN Or it's This you you so did you Where ? 
UNKNOWN These I'm sorry . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah we have people uh uh listening to the trends everywhere in the world , of course , as you know our company is quite big and uh so I'm just asking them what are the current trends according to them when they go in the stores and when they ask uh their uh friends that are also well . 
SURPRISE Oh .
CONFIRMATION Oh , okay , mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN It's not from mm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It's more general trend it's not particular to the remote control . 
UNKNOWN No , it's not it's not this this is very general , yeah . 
UNKNOWN But it seems that trends travel across things . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN The what we Sure . 
UNKNOWN Yeah but some materials n they're to be uh they're to be something like solid like they can't be really spongy or yeah yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN We have to I think we have to have the look of fruit and vegetables but we still have to put our chips inside , so of course . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah sponge , yeah yeah at least that's Yeah yeah that yeah yeah . 
UNKNOWN This is your problem . 
UNKNOWN This is not mine . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , looking yeah fruit . 
UNKNOWN These things can be easily incorporated . 
UNKNOWN We can have t colours or this shape or at least yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I think in the colours and in the uh the kind of material . 
UNKNOWN If if it's something like rubber made or I think it it's also going to be good . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Okay ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN No more question ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
CONFIRMATION Thanks . 
UNKNOWN So Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so we will have uh next meeting in thirty minutes again . 
UNKNOWN Um now you have to go straight on this individual action which i which are for Rama uh wil design , um Mark the user interface design , and uh Sammy uh the product evaluation . 
UNKNOWN Look and feel de Hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Uh you will work together uh on a new on on a prototype using modelling clay . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Mm sounds interesting . 
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm um and I as always your personal coach will send you specific instruction . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Thanks . 
UNKNOWN So , can we highlight the specific features of our yeah , so so we want the speech recogniser and we want some kind of buttons and we want some themes like fruits or vegetables , that's we want to follow general trend . 
UNKNOWN Yeah you're right , you have to So you say s S do we agree on that ? 
UNKNOWN Spongy . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN We have to . 
UNKNOWN So , do you think Hmm . 
UNKNOWN So we have to uh for yeah so are we confident enough on creating trends ? 
UNKNOWN No , we don't have to , but seems it's the trend . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN Again , as I said we can also try to make it , to create the trend . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So there's no Well , that's you t can try to convince us . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well , we can make it smell like fruit . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Okay , that's a good idea . 
UNKNOWN That's So what about location and these things , people are really interesting on those features ? 
UNKNOWN that's a good idea , I Uh I think i yeah i it's again in this uh what I said first it has to be fancy so I think if nobody else pro provides currently a remote control with that kind of stuff and if we can provide it I think it's a good sell for us because we have it and others don't . 
UNKNOWN So titanium smell like fruit . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Or they really like They more want these fancy features like Feature Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN It's fancy . 
UNKNOWN Whether it's useful or not doesn't seem to be very important . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I I agree with uh this uh Now we have to decide on what kind of fanciness . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Do we take titanium smelling like fruit , or do we make spongy uh fruity-like Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh we will try to explore these two options and yeah yeah . 
UNKNOWN Maybe you could explore the two option . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm , mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Could we make a titanium shape ? 
UNKNOWN Uh yeah at least like we can make banana or yeah it's it's yeah that's a we're to look for and and s we're to see the whether rubber is expensive and d Hmm . 
UNKNOWN I mean fruit-shaped . 
UNKNOWN Don't you say that you cannot do double shape uh curved shape yeah . 
UNKNOWN But Doub double-curved . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Seems to be . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Okay , okay . 
UNKNOWN In fact I just agreed to make uh to make the like titanium panels on a whole rubber body . 
UNKNOWN Well , okay w we'll see . 
UNKNOWN Mm-mm . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so you explore now that you're going to work together these these two . 
UNKNOWN Yeah We'll see . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Or or spongy an yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Maybe we can have two different assembly also like one spongy and one kind of titanium . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN we have only the plastic or the the chippy yeah fibre chips or Uh . 
UNKNOWN If you have time . 
UNKNOWN We'll see . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah I don't think w I think we have to choose . 
UNKNOWN If we choose uh titanium or if we choose spongy but uh it cannot be both . 
UNKNOWN We'll see . 
UNKNOWN I I really don't like this modelling clay 'cause you know it makes some for for I dunno uh yeah um we'll look . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN For creation . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Ah you can pretend that it's uh titanium . 
UNKNOWN Even design . 
UNKNOWN You can paint it afterward . 
UNKNOWN Okay , okay . 
UNKNOWN No problem . 
UNKNOWN We have a very large department of paint . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , do don't worry , you you you speak with mm mm . 
UNKNOWN You will do it . 
UNKNOWN Alright , alright . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So explore a shape . 
UNKNOWN So still we want to keep L_C_D_ ? 
UNKNOWN Or Okay . 
UNKNOWN Mm I think it's what we say , that we have an uh an L_C_D_ with uh information . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Not uh Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN The thing is that uh if we want to have as he says if we want to have uh a small number of buttons we need to have a kind of output that says currently what their actions are . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , then we can yeah , yeah , that user friendly or Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN That's the converse to having zillions of button where each button does only one thing . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN and we just stick with two batteries so it's not any solar or yeah yeah j yeah , because Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Classical , we stay classical in that we don't reinvent uh the wheel . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah , yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Anyway it's very in general I think people uh change T_V_ more often than batteries of their remote control . 
UNKNOWN So . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Because the trend goes faster than the life of the So it's very Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So are we mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN We're done . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , we're done . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So see you in thirty minutes . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Good morning everybody . 
UNKNOWN Good morning . 
UNKNOWN Good morning . 
UNKNOWN So , we are asked to to make uh uh a new remote control for television . 
UNKNOWN And the characteristics of this new remote control should be original and trendy and of course user user friendly . 
UNKNOWN So people can can use it without any any problem . 
UNKNOWN . 
UNKNOWN I don't know . 
UNKNOWN Well , I think we should set the the points to to drive the project and uh Yeah , from the account manager . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN B did you send us an emailabout this ? 
UNKNOWN Uh , not yet , but if you want Do you want do you want me to send you a mail? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , we we received an emailabout this uh d designs. 
UNKNOWN Ah it's Okay . 
UNKNOWN Or Uh . 
UNKNOWN Or you can put it in the shared folder . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , you see the email? 
UNKNOWN You email. 
UNKNOWN The v very no , no the first one . 
UNKNOWN No , I didn't get it . 
UNKNOWN It's inside . 
UNKNOWN This one . 
UNKNOWN No , no . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN The third one . 
UNKNOWN Oh , you didn't get anything . 
UNKNOWN No , . 
UNKNOWN It's strange . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN I got an emailabout the dis about the discussion . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN You get email, . 
UNKNOWN I dunno from who . 
UNKNOWN From the account manager . 
UNKNOWN You have received the same email, right ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think it's for your guys to how to design it all the aspects so you need that information . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , I think so . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , so each of us has a role to do . 
UNKNOWN Yeah I think assign your uh roles . 
UNKNOWN S For each for each one . 
UNKNOWN In each We already have our role . 
UNKNOWN For each person , yeah . 
UNKNOWN 'Kay , we can So there are three kinds of designs, that's all . 
UNKNOWN So there are so we have three f yeah . 
UNKNOWN We have functional design , conceptual design , and detail design . 
UNKNOWN Okay , alright . 
UNKNOWN So , who will be the the responsible for the functional design ? 
UNKNOWN Any any volunteer ? 
UNKNOWN I think our uh responsibilities will be assigned when we in our mailwe received from the account manager . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh No , I'm doing the interface . 
UNKNOWN I'm doing the interface . 
UNKNOWN You are doing th . 
UNKNOWN Are you using the you are doing the in Ah Okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah I I'm I'm Well , maybe we have okay so I industrial design . 
UNKNOWN It was a little confusion about my uh but it's alright . 
UNKNOWN Okay , I'll for industrial design . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN And and you Norman ? 
UNKNOWN Mm ? 
UNKNOWN Um working on i . 
UNKNOWN User . 
UNKNOWN User interface . 
UNKNOWN And And doing the marketing . 
UNKNOWN Uh , I'm into marketing . 
UNKNOWN yeah nothing much in the project . 
UNKNOWN Nothing related here to the Next . 
UNKNOWN Marketing in this design . 
UNKNOWN A design is basically for industrial design and the user interface . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN You see the second mail? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , it's inside . 
UNKNOWN Go down . 
UNKNOWN Appendix . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , this is . 
UNKNOWN See there's a role for everybody . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's right , first . 
UNKNOWN Even for the marketing . 
UNKNOWN us user define . 
UNKNOWN But look at your role , your marketing role . 
UNKNOWN There's a trend watching . 
UNKNOWN I don't know . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's your role . 
UNKNOWN I . 
UNKNOWN Well , I think we can have a little discussion about what has to be done and what are your ideas about the Well , w we want to have a new re remote control for for T_V_ distribution I guess . 
UNKNOWN About the design or Maybe we'll discuss this later , no ? 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So we have to plan how how it would be developed and uh how we can make it work . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN I mean working remotes we already have . 
UNKNOWN This will be something different from the other remotes remote controls . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I dunno I Yeah . 
UNKNOWN What we we have to keep in mind the these characteristics . 
UNKNOWN And of course it should not be very costly . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's right . 
UNKNOWN So About the about what ? 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Well I I think that Norman and I would think about um the technical points and um we should discuss it in the next meeting , or Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Need to collect information . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN I I'm part of design , perhaps . 
UNKNOWN Uh , what is most important in a in a remote control ? 
UNKNOWN What is the most important function aspect ? 
CONFUSION Uh . 
UNKNOWN You mean the external or Yeah of g of course . 
UNKNOWN Well , you have to make it work . 
UNKNOWN That's the that's the big thing . 
UNKNOWN That's alright . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , it should be easy to work with . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN We can think about an interface with uh well Yeah , yeah . 
CONFUSION Uh . 
UNKNOWN We maybe you can have a speech uh recognition interface . 
UNKNOWN You just tell the television I want which channel . 
UNKNOWN Or or you can say for example , um I want uh to list all the programme tonight . 
UNKNOWN You won't I I think if we include a lot of technology on the remote control it will be very costly . 
UNKNOWN Y you know , instead of uh remote control it's doing the some searching for you , so you don't have to look for the channel you want . 
UNKNOWN Just say maybe I just want to press I wanna have a button for all the movies tonight . 
UNKNOWN Or a button for all the magazines , all the information documentarytonight . 
UNKNOWN And then you list a few , and I will choose from the list . 
UNKNOWN So instead of pressing the channel number , I am choosing the programmes directly . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's one way of uh making it useful . 
UNKNOWN No , because no , it's not very a lot . 
UNKNOWN S Like s uh you you you say we can use speech . 
UNKNOWN Th this information exists . 
UNKNOWN For example you can get um You can use uh well for example anything . 
UNKNOWN The the idea of using speech to reduce the button , but uh and it's more natural . 
UNKNOWN I I think if you want t to choose uh from a list of programme or or something like that you you may have to to use uh w uh I dunno Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I'm a okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I mean the main uh function of remote control is to have something in the hand and we should be very careful about the size of the remote control . 
UNKNOWN In the hand . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN If we are going to add a speech interface , I'm not sure with trendy slim size of the remote control it would be able to put a speech recog if you want to put a speech recognition system f interface for that I think the T_V_ itself could have it . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yes , possible . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And I could talk to the T_V_ television itself . 
UNKNOWN Except if if you are far from the T_V_ . 
UNKNOWN I need not have an I mean we have some or something , different technology but Mm-hmm , yeah . 
UNKNOWN This is it's Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah . 
UNKNOWN But th the main idea I wanted to s I wanted to say is that um there should be a function , instead of choosing the ch T_V_ channel , there's a option you can choose , either T_V_ channels or or pr or the or the contain or the contents of the programme . 
UNKNOWN On the content . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah it's it's a good idea it's a good idea but I I think that technically it would be um a little bit uh uh more tricky to to achieve this than just to Yeah yeah . 
UNKNOWN So it's more powerful . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN No , because you see now all the T_V_ programmes are available on the webs . 
UNKNOWN They they are they are they are available in X_M_L_ format or whatever the format . 
UNKNOWN We don't care . 
UNKNOWN We just say that this are some content . 
UNKNOWN We just want to retrieve the content and then classi sort them by the types of programmes . 
UNKNOWN Some of the websites they already provide this service , so we can just use the service available . 
UNKNOWN Download it uh to the to this remote control . 
UNKNOWN And then there's there are only six buttons for six categories , or sev seven . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN The most there are only seven buttons . 
UNKNOWN So I just choose the category one and you reuse the same button , for example to to choose among the the sorted list the programme you want , so you don't have to choose among hundred channels , if you have hundred channels , you just have six buttons , seven buttons . 
UNKNOWN Yeah we should also optimise the the number of buttons . 
UNKNOWN Well I I I I think that j just by using navigation buttons and the user interface on the screen we are able to uh navigate uh through the Well channel programme or contents or in an easy way , so Yeah in the dis display on the T_V_ screen and just uh with the with your remote control would just navigate through the f Yeah , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah . 
UNKNOWN This is good idea . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Ah , yes . 
UNKNOWN So . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , so you don't have to display here , just display on the T_V_ screen , right ? 
UNKNOWN Good idea . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN I think I think that will be revol revolutionary . 
UNKNOWN Because all the T_V_ uh the the remote control have all numbers , lots of buttons and then you dunno what to choose in the end . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So I think for for the technical points we have to to to check how to gather the data from programme or contents and all this stuff Oh right so Please , Norman , drawuh Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So we have five minutes to Ah you can y you can you can use it if you so , can we S You it . 
UNKNOWN Ah w w we have sometimes to use the white-board . 
UNKNOWN Five minutes . 
UNKNOWN And another interesting idea for this would be to have an light adaptation system depending upon the picture of So , I mean , if you're watching a movie and suddenly there is a dark uh some dark scene , the lights adapt themself . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN The lighting in the room changes . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but we are designing just remote control . 
UNKNOWN I mean , we have a option in the remote control . 
UNKNOWN If we want to have that option , you press that button in the remote . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Okay , do you want to have a conceptual remote control there , or you just want to put the function in ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN If if you you you can if you want you can use th the . 
UNKNOWN Go on , drawsomething . 
UNKNOWN Oh , I'm afraid you forgot to put your lapel . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Where is it ? 
UNKNOWN The lapel . 
UNKNOWN Or before the before the the design that says . 
UNKNOWN Ah , okay . 
UNKNOWN Where where is it ? 
UNKNOWN Here . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that one . 
UNKNOWN Just plug it . 
UNKNOWN Norman . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's right . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Be before before writing you can uh sit and that says what we what we said then after that you can you can use the . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Okay , alright . 
UNKNOWN So so the most functional des mm the most important function is to ch choo buttons to choose the content . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Right ? 
UNKNOWN We agree on that , right ? 
UNKNOWN Uh , uh first one is to uh buttons i or it could be anything with buttons . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh to choose uh content s or channels . 
UNKNOWN So we have both . 
UNKNOWN The user can choose w which one they want , right ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , by content or by channel , it's a good idea . 
UNKNOWN By content or by channel . 
UNKNOWN Choose by contents or by channels . 
UNKNOWN So And then what did we say just now ? 
UNKNOWN Other than this . 
UNKNOWN And uh we we have to find a way how to gather information about the contents . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so technically how the problems that how to do it is to how to get the content . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Challenge . 
UNKNOWN I think i it's not very difficult to to browse by channel but it's a little bit tricky to browse by contents so I think that's the the things to do and uh to uh reflect about it and uh discuss it in the next meeting . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Content . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so these we have to work it out . 
UNKNOWN So this one of the problem . 
UNKNOWN And uh The main thing . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
UNKNOWN Alright , okay . 
UNKNOWN So we are we'll discuss it we will get some information in the next meeting , so for now we get uh the funct this is the functional designer ? 
UNKNOWN That's the first aspect . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN We will get information and then we'll come back in . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN . 
THANKS Thank you everybody . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , we'll come . 
UNKNOWN So maybe we'll meet in maybe five minutes ? 
UNKNOWN And we'll discuss the other other aspects . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
UNKNOWN Alright , okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
THANKS Thank you , mis Good morning . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Well thank you all . 
UNKNOWN So we come again for the the second meeting . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Uh for the aim of this meeting now is to to make presentationabout uh the work for each one . 
UNKNOWN And take the the decision about the the design and the functionality of the the remote control . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN And we have think I got a new project requirement . 
UNKNOWN So I think uh teletext becomes outdated . 
UNKNOWN So the popularity of the since the popularity of the internet , and I think we don't need lighting adaptive , so the remote control should be only used for the the television . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN And of course we should have our image in the in the design . 
UNKNOWN So , let's start with the the industrial designer . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , alright . 
UNKNOWN . 
UNKNOWN So uh Well I have a PowerPointpr presentationstored in my in my personal folder so I I I think you can reach it from here . 
UNKNOWN Or y you can use the whiteboard if you want . 
UNKNOWN Here . 
UNKNOWN Just go to explorer . 
UNKNOWN Or open . 
UNKNOWN Oh okay . 
UNKNOWN Participant two . 
UNKNOWN Participant two . 
UNKNOWN This one . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Open uh . 
UNKNOWN Uh open . 
UNKNOWN Do you want to open Ah . 
UNKNOWN Because it's open you mean . 
UNKNOWN Right , so um I will talk about the the w working design and And um well I I will present my my first idea on how to build the our new remote control for television . 
UNKNOWN F_ five . 
UNKNOWN Slideshow , view slideshow , . 
UNKNOWN So uh can you go one pagedown , please . 
UNKNOWN So I think the first things to do is to define the hardware components neededs to achieve uh what we want to do . 
UNKNOWN So uh mm I'm thin uh I think uh I I'll do a survey about what is uh what is available on the market and what what is the the cheapest possible things we hav we can use . 
UNKNOWN Then uh I will try with the technical team to to build a prototype and to see uh with uh h how this little box would uh look look like . 
UNKNOWN And how an and we can uh start troubleshooting first uh com communication problems or things like that . 
UNKNOWN And when we are ready with this first prototype I I think we can add some software functionalities on a programmable chip like browsing by content or um things like that . 
UNKNOWN Okay so can you go down uh So , wha what I think for now is we don't want to have a remote control w which is wired so uh I think we u we can use a battery for the . 
UNKNOWN Then two programmable chips for both software functionalities and communication . 
UNKNOWN And the communication with the T_V_ set is uh made through uh infrared communication So uh this is the the schemaof the o of the future uh remote controls so uh you can you can see the components , uh battery and uh the two chips goes to the infrared uh connection to the T_V_ set . 
UNKNOWN Did you drawit ? 
UNKNOWN Wow . 
UNKNOWN This . 
UNKNOWN This . 
UNKNOWN What is the other chip for ? 
UNKNOWN The one on top . 
UNKNOWN The one on top is for the um well the functionali the functionalities and the the th red um sorry the green one is is to well , putting things together , um f transform the data into uh qu into the format to to uh to communicate with the T_V_ set . 
UNKNOWN One is a communication . 
UNKNOWN For men . 
UNKNOWN To the in Okay . 
UNKNOWN And , that's it . 
UNKNOWN I think we should use a F_P_G_A_ for for the functionalities which is easy to to t It's field programmable uh something array . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN What is F_P_G_A_ ? 
UNKNOWN Gateway arrays . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It's a field programmable gateway arrays . 
UNKNOWN So why's it how is it different from the Bluetooth ? 
UNKNOWN Well , uh a F_P_G_A_ is just a chip you can uh you can pr programme it uh wi with wh whatever you want . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Programme it . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN And uh well the Bluetooth chip is just responsible to uh make the communication uh between uh the two devices . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh So this are the they have to work together ? 
UNKNOWN Or ? 
UNKNOWN Do they have to work together or two separate choice Okay . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN Well , th the F_P_G_A_ will produce the the data to send . 
UNKNOWN Or it's something like isn't hardware the first one ? 
UNKNOWN And the second one is for the software . 
UNKNOWN Is the is the software par alri okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah to run th to make it run . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN That's it . 
UNKNOWN Okay , okay . 
UNKNOWN So you can control if you want , right ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN Alright and that's it for the working design . 
UNKNOWN So if you have any questions ? 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Okay , and how about the battery power ? 
UNKNOWN Uh you mean that battery would be somewhere there and the remote contro the power to the battery comes through infrared ? 
UNKNOWN Uh no no no no , I think uh we have uh to to uh have uh embedded uh b batteries in in the yeah into the t . 
UNKNOWN Into the more compact and uh okay , . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah . 
UNKNOWN And uh I I don't think it will need um very uh much power to make it run , so Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN You can put it on the charger when uh you when you don't need to use it . 
UNKNOWN It's a good idea . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's right . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Having a charger rather than putting the battery cells always . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN People don't like it to have to buy the batteries when they run out . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN We just make a small charger and put it Bu Our remote , we do not want to make it P_D_A_ . 
UNKNOWN Uh mm . 
UNKNOWN Y yeah , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Because you are using because you are using Bluetooth , if some people have P_D_A_ they can use their P_D_A_ to control the T_V_ if they want to , right ? 
UNKNOWN That's a good idea . 
UNKNOWN You can i yeah . 
UNKNOWN Ma Yeah we can change the b . 
UNKNOWN Also , but but I I I think uh the the goal is to sell our remote control . 
UNKNOWN I dunno . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN S okay , so charger for is the . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN So is mine . 
UNKNOWN It's mine . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN Participant one , no ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , this your Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Oh we have so let's move to to user interface design . 
UNKNOWN So you can open uh three . 
UNKNOWN Participant During the weekend . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So So I'm working on the technical functions design . 
UNKNOWN can you show the next slide. 
UNKNOWN So the the purpose is to to find uh the important questions to ask is what effect should the apparatus have . 
UNKNOWN So so I found on a webs on the internet yeah . 
UNKNOWN I spent a lot of time searching and uh and I found that uh the function of remote control is to send messages to television set . 
UNKNOWN That's good . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN G Yeah , not the T_V_s . 
UNKNOWN For example switch on , switch off , switch the next channel and so on and so on . 
UNKNOWN So I found two very good prototypes for for this interface from our competitors so can you Yeah , yeah , yeah . 
UNKNOWN This are usual functionality . 
UNKNOWN Ours is a bit uh different . 
UNKNOWN So these are two example . 
UNKNOWN One is from the other one is from , yeah , uh engineering centr yeah . 
UNKNOWN Tasks . 
UNKNOWN This is the most competing prototypes I've found . 
UNKNOWN But then uh loo but then I found if you look at you see on the left one there are too many buttons Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And they are small . 
UNKNOWN O on the right I tried to play with the problem is that uh if I have hundred channels I have uh I have to choo press the other button to choose the hundred channels and I have to compose the number so it's very lousy . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Of course . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So you so you move to the next the next one . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , so I talk about the problem . 
UNKNOWN And then I I look at the user manual they are a hundred pages thick , so we don't want that . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So I propose the easy to use uh prototype . 
UNKNOWN You can navigate on T_V_ screen and we can the user's preference and we need to have the T_V_ connected to internet so we end in order to access the T_V_ programmes by X_M_L_ and we need some to do some preprocessing . 
UNKNOWN From the technical aspect , the processing should be done on the T_V_ set than on the on the remote controller , right ? 
UNKNOWN And then we the speech recognition as uh Harry says we may just put in we may K_I_V_ . 
UNKNOWN What do you mean by the pa pa processing will be done on the T_V_ than the So we should have specific T_V_ ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , all the processing is done the T_V_ is a compu has some processing power the Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So we have to t We have to sell a T_V_ with the remote control too . 
UNKNOWN Or ? 
UNKNOWN We can use this . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , we don't Yeah , I think so . 
UNKNOWN Yeah because are you just wondering what controller okay . 
UNKNOWN J j just the remote control . 
UNKNOWN I think there there is there is al there there is a a technology like show view who is already available on most of the T_V_ set on recorders or thing like that and we can try t to get this information on to the remote control to to do the processing on the remote control because Yes , that's a good idea , I think . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's right . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So i the processing on on the remote controller so it can u be used in any T_V_ , any conventional T_V_ sets ? 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , we . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Speech recognition . 
UNKNOWN N yeah , that's all . 
UNKNOWN The next one ? 
UNKNOWN So I come up with a simple design , just keep the v navigation buttons . 
UNKNOWN Keep the navigation but . 
UNKNOWN We d we don't we we don't need really much buttons to i if we have a screen to navigate on on the T_V_ so uh Well , f four five buttons , it's sufficient . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN It's easy to build , it does not consume much power . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's right . 
UNKNOWN Okay , that's all . 
UNKNOWN Oh , but you have a catch there , um assume that um if you want to go to if you are watching channel two and if you want to go to channel ninety nine , then . 
UNKNOWN Well , then y you you go to the main menu and uh you have uh go to channel and then uh you can Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN No , because you choose by channel , so you choose by T_V_ program so you don't have hundred channels to choose from . 
UNKNOWN Uh-huh huh huh huh . 
UNKNOWN Maybe you . 
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm hmm hmm . 
UNKNOWN If you go by channel , you don't have to do that . 
UNKNOWN but uh I I think i i if you if you want to to make uh well a a big jump but uh well you you have to to have a a a device when you could you could Well , not a mouse but uh something that that says more clearly that uh right , left , up , down , well , the to have the ability to to to write something to the navigator , maybe directly , or So , we can think of buttons like in the telephone to send messages or things like that . 
UNKNOWN But Yeah then yeah that's right . 
UNKNOWN So you are Mm . 
UNKNOWN Ah . 
UNKNOWN Ah , a big jump . 
UNKNOWN A mouse or Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Mm hmm hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN But we'll see . 
UNKNOWN How the this remote ? 
UNKNOWN Uh it's gonna be small . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , of course small . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So it'll beep if you wanna find it you just uh shout y h just it just has to re respond to you when you look for the device . 
UNKNOWN too small that it goes under the sofa and we can't find it . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's . 
UNKNOWN I dunno how bu And responds to you , and I- mm . 
UNKNOWN just give it a name and we call him . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's right . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's right . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so uh next presentationMm . 
UNKNOWN Participant four . 
UNKNOWN So Harry . 
UNKNOWN Okay , after having the inputs from industrial design and user interface , I think most of the points which I want to are already covered here . 
UNKNOWN And to find the most interesting features what the users would be interested , then what we have done is we have put a feedback forms in all the magazines , and the users send the feedbacks , and based on that These are the findings which we got and yeah adding of a speech interface is always good for a T_V_ remote but the technology We already know that as discussed earlier An it does how feasible it is . 
UNKNOWN Well I I think it will be a , yes , a bit complicated to um make a speech recognisers runs on the small uh ts Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But I think if you to recognise numbers it's a well-studied problem . 
UNKNOWN I if you just recognise uh numbers is a limited you have limited vocabulary Mm . 
UNKNOWN Oh we can put an limited vocabulary as in the mobile phones . 
UNKNOWN We just have the it's not going to take much space also . 
UNKNOWN And this can allow to choose the the program , for instance without uh adding uh buttons so it's a good idea . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It's going to be very slim . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN And next one was the size of the remote control . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN It has to be of course a very slim and small one . 
UNKNOWN And of course most of the people are interested in if it's less expensive , so this is an important criteria here is I mean we have to look for a trade-off . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN But Mm . 
UNKNOWN But do you think what they sug suggested s possibility . 
UNKNOWN The features and the cost . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I no I I think that uh i if we go for quality people may tolerate for high quality and of course comes with uh reasonable cost . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Maybe not less , but they may be willing to pay little bit more for comfort , yeah , extra features . 
UNKNOWN Little bit more if it's with extra features . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , s s speech is a important extra feature I think Well , uh Well , we are we we just have to find a mean how to to add a m a a a microphone or uh well yes a microphone into the the remote control , so I well it will be alright . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN That's right . 
UNKNOWN But is it useful or not u I don't know . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN There is in the Mm . 
UNKNOWN I mean , for a lazy guys they could say nine and the nine channel comes . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Or they say movie name or I don't go for movie names but only for the numbers on the channel , or volume up , volume down , brightness , contrast . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN So , I think this should be a good idea , to put this features . 
UNKNOWN And the fourth one was the teletext in various languages . 
UNKNOWN Mm , I think Yeah as discussed in the earlier meeting , but I think uh not much people are really interested in this point if it's not really required . 
UNKNOWN I think i If it's necessary can you can do that . 
UNKNOWN What is the teletext ? 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN We can integrate small microphone in the remote so it's not really a problem . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN What about lighting adaptive options ? 
UNKNOWN According to the re to the new requirements I think we don't need that . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It is interesting but we are only concerned with the remote controller . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN So you need s special T_V_ sets to do that ? 
UNKNOWN Or it's it's done via this remote controller ? 
UNKNOWN It's very complex . 
UNKNOWN I mean I mean yeah , it's for the um industrial design and users interface designers to decide if it's going to be working or not . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I think it's a bit complex too For our next product , our new T_V_ set with uh automatical uh sound adjustment light . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN I think I think as I discussed th that four points would be good for um marketing . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , then we can conclude that . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but it's quite possible but maybe not in this project . 
UNKNOWN So we have I think we have s still we have couple of minutes . 
UNKNOWN Mm-mm . 
UNKNOWN So any things to to discuss ? 
UNKNOWN Or any suggestions ? 
UNKNOWN The speech interface and uh less uh reasonable uh cost . 
UNKNOWN Expensive . 
UNKNOWN Price . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN And the lighting adaptation and the teletext . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN And regarding the teletext uh these are the subtitl these are the text information which you got on the televisions . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN If you are watching an foreign movie , you get subtitles sometimes . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN And uh if you are a French guy watching an English movie you would like to have it in French . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN And if I am a German then I would like to have the my options in German . 
UNKNOWN So , the remote it should have some it should give me some flexibility of choosing the ch languages . 
UNKNOWN Function . 
UNKNOWN That should be a good uh point . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but well what about the the new project's requirement ? 
UNKNOWN I I I think we should give up with teletext , no ? 
UNKNOWN I think we we can we is the . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN Well , so maybe we we can j we can already think uh about a way to to access the internet via the television . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Because if Yeah , but uh we can think that in a few years there will be T_V_ set that can access the internet . 
UNKNOWN Using the T_V_ to access the internet ? 
UNKNOWN Or what ? 
UNKNOWN I didn't quite understand Yeah , okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So it's a good idea if i i if we i if if we uh think about how to to to build up our remote uh control w with this functionality in a w which will c which will come in a few years . 
UNKNOWN We already have some . 
UNKNOWN So if we already have it in our remote control Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So you have to anticipate the the future ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN The future demand , market demand . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's right . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , to desi well , not not to implement it , but to well , to find a way to to add to add this functionality in a yeah , in an in an easy manner , if is possible . 
UNKNOWN The functionality in the future . 
UNKNOWN . 
UNKNOWN In future . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Because all the T_V_ sets will be digital , right . 
UNKNOWN All the programmes , everything will be in digital than analog . 
UNKNOWN Th the system will change and we have to anticipate for those change . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So Okay , thank you . 
UNKNOWN So let's go for the the lunch break , and we will meet after . 
CONFIRMATION Okay , thank you . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
THANKS Thank you . 
UNKNOWN So in last meeting we have discussed the conceptual design and we asked you to prepare a prototype for the for the remote control . 
UNKNOWN So . 
UNKNOWN So let's see the what did you prepare . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , so can you go out to the shared folder ? 
UNKNOWN Mm the shared folder . 
UNKNOWN Sh share folder for th your presentation? 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN We have a presentation. 
UNKNOWN Because I have here Okay just one . 
UNKNOWN Uh So I got the participant uh three . 
UNKNOWN W uh . 
UNKNOWN Three . 
UNKNOWN It's the final design , yeah . 
UNKNOWN S so so I discussed with Guillaume . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And uh so we have and we we are both agreed on some two versions of the prototypes , because we were no not decided whether we wanted to have an L_C_D_ or not because it's too expensive . 
UNKNOWN So we come up with two versions . 
UNKNOWN One with and one without L_C_D_s . 
UNKNOWN Um but both comes with a charger and then detachable and uh or control module . 
UNKNOWN And detachable big buttons for all people um . 
UNKNOWN So . 
UNKNOWN S okay so I'll show you the the two prototypes . 
UNKNOWN Here we have the first one with the beautiful uh L_C_D_ um display . 
UNKNOWN You you can s here . 
UNKNOWN And you can uh just um browse into the the navigation menu by uh joystick joystick-like uh button . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN You can uh choose the direction and if you just push on it it's considered like a enter function . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN You have on the mm on the side here the microphone for the for the speech recognition system here . 
UNKNOWN And here the the switch that control if you want Well I I I think uh it's the Yeah but Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Why you why you you put it in the the side ? 
UNKNOWN It's not a good place maybe . 
UNKNOWN No i i it's the all around camer uh microphone isn't it . 
UNKNOWN The the microphone picks up the speeches from anywhere . 
UNKNOWN Is it an only a single mic or a microphone array ? 
UNKNOWN Well so it's a microphone array . 
UNKNOWN Oh it's very costly , microphone array . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN No it's just a single microphone , and you I I think uh we we put it here because I think when you when you are browsing your L_C_D_ you will be close to well it's better to to to place it here th than here , for instance . 
UNKNOWN Yeah Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN And here is a little switch that control if you want the the speaker uh recognition system to um to be on or off . 
UNKNOWN And uh so this remote control comes up with its charger . 
UNKNOWN How much does it cost this one ? 
UNKNOWN Well this this prototype is um made for about uh well fi fi fifteen fifteen dollars fifteen dollars , but uh well it's not it's not uh yeah , but uh it's just a prototype and if we uh if we optimises the um the uh voila . 
UNKNOWN For the Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Fifteen dollars ? 
UNKNOWN Ah it's above it's above the budget . 
UNKNOWN The cost would be le reduced . 
UNKNOWN Yeah the and the the production costs we we can achieve uh about ten dollars . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN How many b battery is there ? 
UNKNOWN How many , excuse me ? 
UNKNOWN Battery . 
UNKNOWN Well uh f battery , we use uh about uh Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Is it n the two A_A_s batteries in it . 
UNKNOWN A_A_ rechargeable batteries . 
UNKNOWN Rechargeable of course , because we have the charger . 
UNKNOWN Yeah rechargeable batteries . 
UNKNOWN We have the charger so it's no problem . 
UNKNOWN Yeah and you just On uh yeah one battery . 
UNKNOWN So one one battery ? 
UNKNOWN Is that two or one ? 
UNKNOWN It's kinetic reserve . 
UNKNOWN Actually uh it's a flexible thing . 
UNKNOWN You just n uh Yeah yeah . 
UNKNOWN Now what is the whole day rating for that ? 
UNKNOWN The excuse me ? 
UNKNOWN Whole day's rating . 
UNKNOWN What type of battery ? 
UNKNOWN Oh yeah it's just a r uh simple battery a rechargeable uh if you uh like it's exist . 
UNKNOWN Something like a two A_ , A_ three size batteries ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So and if you want to charge the battery you just put the remote control like that to plug in the the charger and uh leave it uh alone , it's alright . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Then the next time you pick it , oh it works . 
UNKNOWN At uh yeah . 
UNKNOWN I forgot to tell you there is only a single button there , b this button yeah alright . 
UNKNOWN Yeah just explain the button uh Norman . 
UNKNOWN This button is like the mouse is like a joystick , you can move in three hundred and sixty degrees of direction so you can make a turn and it the additi functions associated to all the actions you ma you have a click you have a double click all in a single button . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN You can move up , down , left , right , or you can do a swing . 
UNKNOWN So a swing to the left , a swing to the right defines other functions . 
UNKNOWN So even though it's a single button , but it is pretty s flexible because of the three hundred and sixty degree movement . 
UNKNOWN And the L_C_D_ is this one , on the remote ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN This is the version y that comes with L_C_D_ . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Here I present another version without the L_C_D_ . 
UNKNOWN I think it's not a good idea because after maybe one or two months of function is getting destroyed . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN If you Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Uh okay this is new prototype uh . 
UNKNOWN Yeah it's So we have the the second version also with the different uh button configuration . 
UNKNOWN The second version is also simpler , we d uh we had just uh I have to put the microphone also . 
UNKNOWN So basically th it's the same uh yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh-huh and also the switch . 
UNKNOWN Yeah yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Basically it's the same uh things uh uh as uh I presented before . 
UNKNOWN But here we have uh we have uh four buttons for navigation . 
UNKNOWN Press one button uh acting as a a enter button . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN So um yeah according to what you said it's more robust to the user . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN And uh it's also cheaper to produce . 
UNKNOWN We can produce uh such remote control for about uh four dollars . 
UNKNOWN No four dollars , it's good . 
UNKNOWN And I think you forgot a point here to have an button to find the charger , because that's a major that's a Okay and if you disable speech recognition system then ? 
UNKNOWN Oh no th actually th we'll come to that point in our Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah it's it's it's embed in the uh speech recognition system . 
UNKNOWN So so Norman will explain to you . 
UNKNOWN W w I'll I'll come to that point later on . 
UNKNOWN Mm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm . 
UNKNOWN And we will we will serve the charger with this ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah yeah of course mm . 
UNKNOWN Th they either these with the uh the the charger any in either versions you they they ha they use the same charger yeah . 
UNKNOWN With the remote control . 
UNKNOWN Okay so the price of the charger included in the Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Uh it's a standard module so you should get it for a cheap price uh . 
UNKNOWN Thank thank you . 
UNKNOWN And so mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN It's that same charger that you can use for the hand-phone but uh again depends on the types . 
UNKNOWN I think we have to investigate more on that , but Yeah . 
UNKNOWN The price should be below twelve and a half Euro . 
UNKNOWN Yeah but as the Marketing Manager says , people is willing to people are willing to pay more for good design . 
UNKNOWN Well that's so We have we have just The price of selling is twenty five Euros . 
UNKNOWN Yeah people are willing to pay more , but the company is not willing to invest more at the moment . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN And the price of production That's for this basis function and if you want more you pay more . 
UNKNOWN Alright please uh go on Norman with the special features . 
UNKNOWN Or uh Something like customised . 
UNKNOWN Yeah we'll we'll come up to that , the the the thing that makes this the controller cheap is that it is modular so you want more function you pay more . 
UNKNOWN If you want less function i i if you want a reasonable price you pay for the functions that you add on to the system , so is uh modular . 
UNKNOWN Yeah yeah , for example the L_C_D_ , you can take it you can put it put it back in , or you can use the other one , or the speech recogniser with the microphone yeah yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN You want a microphone to put in the speech recogniser you don't wan you pay less for the system you see . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Mm hmm hmm hmm . 
UNKNOWN So It's pretty flexible in the yeah price . 
UNKNOWN Hmm okay . 
UNKNOWN You also have the the the two other modules for the parental control that that you ca you can add up to the to your remote control i i if you uh if you want to to have more more power on what you do , and uh which channel you want to choose and so on . 
UNKNOWN But Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Uh yeah yeah you should present that . 
UNKNOWN And this is other one ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN H here is just the the the module for the kids and th if the parents want to watch T_V_ , up they come up with their modules , they just plug in it and they can have all the control they want here . 
UNKNOWN Mm hmm hmm hmm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah Mm . 
UNKNOWN We also have this module for uh old people with big buttons , clearly labelled , and it acts like the previous one , you just plug in and it works . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah the i the idea the the conceptual idea is that simplicity and powerful . 
UNKNOWN Simplicity meaning that we have few buttons , powerful is that all the controls with the one you saw we saw earlier in the meetings with lots of buttons n but here you only have few buttons but you retain the mm the same powerful functionalities . 
UNKNOWN But in addition with simplicity . 
UNKNOWN So that's the best idea , the cond that that's our uh an innovation um uh i in this uh design here . 
UNKNOWN Okay now we come to other important features that I did not tell you . 
UNKNOWN The first one is the speech recogniser , again it's detachable or add-on . 
UNKNOWN And then we also have security feature for example this here oop it's very robust , it doesn't break and the material , what's the material again ? 
UNKNOWN The titanium and so it's very uh Well so the price to produce For uh the simplest one , say we start from four dollars to produce such a device . 
UNKNOWN Titanium material . 
UNKNOWN Titanium . 
UNKNOWN Again uh and the battery life is uh is an is an endurable one , again because this is A_A_ batteries you can choose the types of battery you want . 
UNKNOWN Yeah that's fine . 
UNKNOWN Lithium-ion may be a good one , but you can replace it with cheaper one , again you pay for what you get , and then um y the other p points are robust and misplacement reminder . 
UNKNOWN So when you finish watching your T_V_ and you the you t you turn off the T_V_ , uh and then there's this message coming out that uh please put that back to the charger , so so that's the or is it that's the reminder part . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah and um And it also use a programmable channel and vocabulary , so we didn't define the vocabulary so it's up to the user to define so sorry ? 
UNKNOWN Mm hmm hmm hmm . 
UNKNOWN And then uh because of the chil because children are using the device so we have also a a of T_V_ programmes by genre , and this can be used by the adult or by the children . 
UNKNOWN So instead of choosing the channel you are choosing the T_V_ contents of the night . 
UNKNOWN So it's pretty powerful , and that's that's why the num buttons are reduced , because of this feature . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And and for the materials that is cheap to produce I think uh it's quite clear from yeah . 
UNKNOWN And also like the and the fancy designsyeah . 
UNKNOWN Maybe we can improve more on the design but uh this is the Yeah . 
UNKNOWN What what's Maybe yeah . 
UNKNOWN What's the price to p to produce ? 
UNKNOWN Uh it's about it The without without the charger it's about uh well two dollars to produce uh the microphone and speech recognition systems . 
UNKNOWN With with with the charge ? 
UNKNOWN With the charger ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Two dollars for the uh for the add-on modules , and finally three dollars for the charger . 
UNKNOWN So if you uh sum up uh everything wi with the L_C_D_ , which costs two dollar , you have two plus four plus four plus two plus two . 
UNKNOWN We don't have charger . 
UNKNOWN It's about so the total cost if you if you want all the fuct functionalities will be about uh fifteen dollars . 
UNKNOWN I think we can use Excel . 
UNKNOWN We don't have all the options . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Charger we don't have charger here either . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN No it's it's below the the the budget . 
UNKNOWN But it's just if you want all functionalities . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Excuse me ? 
UNKNOWN It's below the bu the budget . 
UNKNOWN Yeah it's a nice input but we have an other inputs from the l public demands . 
UNKNOWN We Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think we will just have a rough look and then we can make our statements , and we can finalise the product based on this discu I think we can just go to my presentationthen . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN We can wind up . 
UNKNOWN Or we could uh come to some f uh final conclusions . 
UNKNOWN So the marketing made an evaluation criteria and these were some of the findings , and uh in the market the people are not really interested with L_C_D_ , without L_C_D_ , with speech recognition interface , or without speech recognition interface , but most of the people what they are interested is first thing is , they want to have an fancy look and feel , it should be very fancy with colourful and uh very handy to hold . 
UNKNOWN And the second thing is it should be much more technologically innovative . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Of course in that we could put L_C_D_ or recognition to be more technologically innovative . 
UNKNOWN And the third one is easy to use . 
UNKNOWN Well I think that the technical in innovation is is in the product itself since we haven't yet a remote who are allowing to to choose interactively with the T_V_ screen uh uh with just four buttons . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Okay and if we go to the next slide, here you can find these are the latest fashion updates , and so this in Paris and Milan they have detected this trends that the this year it's going to be an year of fruit and vegetable , so people are really interested to see if they have an remote in the shape of the fruit or a vegetable , or whatever they like . 
UNKNOWN Spongy spongy . 
UNKNOWN Mm mm . 
UNKNOWN So I think it should be much more customised to make a different uh shapes . 
UNKNOWN Mm mm . 
UNKNOWN And the second thing is , and if the material , they really do not want it to be very hard , as in the case of very pl plastic or titanium , it should be somewhat spongy . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN But the the problem is that uh is it robust to mishandling ? 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN We have you should find a material that is robust at the same time spongy . 
UNKNOWN A sponge . 
UNKNOWN Yeah so uh so finally we have these three criterias . 
UNKNOWN Spongy . 
UNKNOWN One is fancy look , second is innovative , and third is easy to use . 
UNKNOWN So these are the f uh three criteria on which we are going to build our remote . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So and we have an evaluation criteria for each one of these , say that we have a seven point scale , from one to seven , and for each of the product you could just give me the scale according to this . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN So now you have with L_C_D_ and without L_C_D_ , so on this scale , if it is true , if it is if it has a fancy look you could just tell me one , or if it is false , it doesn't it looks uh it doesn't look much fancy , then you could just tell me seven . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN So We can make our study on this and No no we have you have designed two products now , one is with L_C_D_ and without L_C_D_ . 
UNKNOWN So so is the e evaluation depending on us or other users ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But who will give the scoring uh we ourself or or a third party ? 
UNKNOWN You . 
UNKNOWN According to you , no according to you designers , how will feel does it uh with L_C_D_ and without L_C_D_ ? 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Okay let us make this L_ and without L_C_D_ . 
UNKNOWN On on this scale the L_C_D_ remote control . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN How do you look how does it look ? 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN D is it very fancy or doesn't look much fancy ? 
UNKNOWN Well it doesn't look much fancy I'll I'll say three or four . 
UNKNOWN And you both agree for that ? 
UNKNOWN And you ? 
UNKNOWN I think we can improve on the design . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Som someone um commented this is like a the stone age uh design . 
UNKNOWN It's it it Technical aspects . 
UNKNOWN Um we have been focused all all this time on the on the technical aspect , functional aspect , but also the simplicity . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN As for the design maybe we c should hire a designer to help . 
UNKNOWN So I take three on with L_C_D_ ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah a three . 
UNKNOWN So without L_C_D_ how would you rate it ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh four . 
UNKNOWN Four . 
UNKNOWN I think it's it's uh more easy to make f fancy things when it's not complicated so removing the L_C_D_ um gives us a li more liberty to to have a fancy look . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And in the sense of innovativeness , with L_C_D_ . 
UNKNOWN Well it's it's the same for both so I will give a five , six . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Five with L_C_D_ and So without L_C_D_ ? 
UNKNOWN Well five also uh Norman please . 
UNKNOWN Yeah from the innovation aspect I feel that uh what is most innovative of our prototype compared to the existing prototypes that we saw l in the last meeting is that um the retrieval of T_V_ programmes by content , because uh that is really innovative , and for now and another innovation we have is simplicity and simplicity , few buttons , we've uh A lot of functionalities . 
UNKNOWN Uh For L_C_D_ . 
UNKNOWN With lot of functionalities . 
UNKNOWN So that is uh that is uh for both th Our gi I think that the our our product is uh has the best in all well this is a biased judgement because we designed them . 
UNKNOWN No no according to design aspect we want to know how would you feel the innovativeness ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh the innovation is v is very high I think . 
UNKNOWN With L_C_D_ . 
UNKNOWN And without L_C_D_ ? 
UNKNOWN Both . 
UNKNOWN Mm for both it's the the same innovations . 
UNKNOWN For both . 
UNKNOWN It's the same innovation . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So maybe I can put six to seven . 
UNKNOWN six , let's go for six . 
UNKNOWN Without L_C_D_ . 
UNKNOWN Both . 
UNKNOWN No actually uh to make it with L_C_D_ you make more efforts . 
UNKNOWN So I there is high innovativeness included if you make it with L_C_D_ y then when it is without L_C_D_ there is not much innovativeness . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Uh no innovative yeah . 
UNKNOWN So we can't go I mean that what you are sayin that's what the design No it's like this , I mean on the L_C_D_ , according to what I understand from your model is , you have a joystick here , and you have L_C_D_ , you just press your joystick , you get here a programme . 
UNKNOWN Uh uh uh there w there was a there was a issue here is that what are what is the display on the L_C_D_ ? 
UNKNOWN We haven't really uh determined what are actually actually it's good to have a L_C_D_ but what are we gonna display on a L_C_D_ ? 
UNKNOWN Talk about Yeah but you have the same programme on the T_V_ screen . 
UNKNOWN So let's remove it . 
UNKNOWN Yeah ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah but Yes exactly . 
UNKNOWN Uh then No on the T_V_ you don't it doesn't display on the T_V_ now . 
UNKNOWN But This is the problem . 
UNKNOWN If you have the L_C_D_ , but if n Yeah . 
UNKNOWN L_C_D_ ? 
UNKNOWN Then uh there is no meaning in having it on the T_V_ . 
UNKNOWN Or then again you have a channels , volume and all the stuff and what a I mean that depends upon your design , so I mean So without L_C_D_ you want to put it fi the same level of innovativeness ? 
UNKNOWN But you cannot display all on a L_C_D_ . 
UNKNOWN Anyway for for the users who who who opt for L_C_D_ we'll give them the give them the L_C_D_ , we give what the customer uh wants , right . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And which do you recommend e easy to use , with L_C_D_ or without L_C_D_ ? 
UNKNOWN Well I think both are really easy to use because there are few button buttons , and uh well t p the menu are clear , well-organised , so Well with little knowing of the technology you can you can easily use the product so I will give a six for the easy to use . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah I think sorry . 
UNKNOWN No it's just if I I see the the f the rate I think it's better to do it without L_C_D_ . 
UNKNOWN Because that's with L_C_D_ just will increase the price , and I thi i they have the same rate so without L_C_D_ it will be Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Or we can just go back to the previous slideuh where we ha we have a few updates . 
UNKNOWN So I mean in the product design you could just amend it to make some few changes according to fruit and vegetable or a spongy touch without L_C_D_ and without speech recognition . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Even then our product is going to be very good . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , it's cheaper to produce . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN S Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And uh if the the well if we have less technology we have more liberty to uh for the shape and uh things like that so Yep . 
UNKNOWN Yeah that's right . 
UNKNOWN I have another thing to say about the easy to use aspect . 
UNKNOWN I think the easy to use uh aspect is different for different people . 
UNKNOWN For the young generation easy to use may be very complicated because uh they w they wants lot of controls with lots of buttons . 
UNKNOWN For kids they want simply the s similarit for the old people they want simplicity , so that's why we have the parental module . 
UNKNOWN Yeah yeah that's right . 
UNKNOWN Uh we can ha have build a more complex design if if they want it , but but uh what I'm trying to say here is that the um we have different sets of buttons for different kinds of people . 
UNKNOWN So in terms of easy to use I think it's very user customisable . 
UNKNOWN User customisation is very important yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah so W uh I think it's the same . 
UNKNOWN So without L_C_D_ I just take it five ? 
UNKNOWN Six . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Or you want it to be six ? 
UNKNOWN Um six . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yes as you say , with better uh yeah . 
UNKNOWN Without L_C_D_ . 
UNKNOWN S s oh I think it's better to have this without L_C_D_ . 
UNKNOWN And to improve the the look . 
UNKNOWN As our Programme Manager s Pro Project Manager says that without L_C_D_ it is going to reduce the cost also , and it's going to be much simpler to use . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Yes and to give us more liberty to have a fancy look so so let's go back to our laboratory and Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So . 
UNKNOWN What a what what about the sys speech recognition ? 
UNKNOWN To improve on the design . 
UNKNOWN Huh ? 
UNKNOWN what about the integration of speech recognition ? 
UNKNOWN The speech recogniser is a add-on module . 
UNKNOWN Right ? 
UNKNOWN That's going to be an optional . 
UNKNOWN If somebody wants to buy it they can have it , otherwise no . 
UNKNOWN Ah so it's optional with the okay . 
UNKNOWN It's an optional . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It's optional yeah , since well according to this study uh people more likes more to have a spongy uh remote control than Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think it will be I think i I think it will be better if we have all these modules in the same remote control , because maybe parents will lose these uh Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but I mean if you have an add-ons , the kids may just uh hide the parental module and so that their parents can't use it . 
UNKNOWN Or ma yeah . 
UNKNOWN Or maybe parents they can for forget where they put it or , so mayb better if you have all this in the same Yeah . 
UNKNOWN In the same set , yeah , and and individual buttons to make them work . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN The problem is if i we are bla if a customer wants a certain component , and doesn't want the parental control because it's a couple who do not have children when you sell the product in the market you could meet any kind of people , and not all people will need all the functionalities we propose to them . 
UNKNOWN So we might lose the customer because of this . 
UNKNOWN I don't know , what do you think uh ? 
UNKNOWN So you mean that even if these modules will be will be functional uh will be optional . 
UNKNOWN Yes exa what do you think , I don't know . 
UNKNOWN You are Marketing Manag . 
UNKNOWN I mean how to how to how to make a marketing survey that uh how many married couple or how many couples have a T_V_ or to the number or singles who have a television . 
UNKNOWN Uh I think it inc increase . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So based on that I think But you can make it on a single P_C_ with three different options . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But the the question is n does those modularity increase the production cost or decrease the production cost ? 
UNKNOWN Well it's about the same because if Well you can if you had uh something li Oh no , because if you if you add uh something well yeah maybe because it's three different pieces uh to to to build but Yeah yeah yeah it's I think it's cheaper if you if you already built the all the functionalities um on the same module , but uh Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think it i increases . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN On the same P_C_B_ yeah yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well well the other aspect is that if in the when they have the ar existing product you you gonna maintain the the you're gonna keep the same customer , because the same customer will come back to buy other add-ons . 
UNKNOWN Yeah that's right . 
UNKNOWN So so Yeah i i so if don't don't buy now they can buy i in the future . 
UNKNOWN I mean you could just provide with an optional . 
UNKNOWN So in in that way you're actually keeping the cus the same customer , attracting them to come back in again and again . 
UNKNOWN So it's something like a Microsoft product update . 
UNKNOWN We're not trying to follow the Microsoft and we don't want to the m Yeah well if the buyers can be up the th would be can be upgraded , it would be a good thing right ? 
UNKNOWN And and we we we we we we don't want that . 
UNKNOWN Updates and we sell it . 
UNKNOWN We make updates and sell it . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , it depends on the v production . 
UNKNOWN And uh what's the idea about uh the shape of the remote controls ? 
UNKNOWN Uh can they be made into a fruit and vegetable types ? 
UNKNOWN Well so Yeah yeah I think we are yeah but we are also the um well the components will have to change because uh we have to deal with the shape and um but I don't think it will uh increase the cost too much so Uh well but it's a bit complicated to if if if you need machines to different machines to um ah well Yeah yeah we can have the same global shape and then uh add on skins and with with this uh tex spongy texture uh things like that . 
UNKNOWN Do you require different types of P_C_B_s and Or uh it could be like this the P_C_B_ would be the same for all , but only the exterior uh shape is different o for all . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN What we can change is to propose the customers with skins . 
UNKNOWN For example the i the mobile phones nowaday , they sell different kinds of skin and then people just feel that oh I have a new skin and looks better . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah that's right . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah that's right . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah you can pl in what material would that be in uh ? 
UNKNOWN Sponge . 
UNKNOWN I think you need to look into the material . 
UNKNOWN Yeah or furry like a pet dog kind of thing . 
UNKNOWN Yeah yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So Project evaluation project satisfaction , for example . 
UNKNOWN So we finished the prototype uh presentationif you have uh something else to say . 
UNKNOWN I think the Project Manager would be interested to look about the financial issues in making these models . 
UNKNOWN I don't know , we have to ask these question . 
UNKNOWN We have to give answers so Project evaluation . 
UNKNOWN I suppose that you this criteria , is it ? 
UNKNOWN Room for creativity . 
UNKNOWN This room is a bit small , but but I think it's okay for us to work with . 
UNKNOWN I feel it's fine , we know we don't need uh I think it's okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah mm . 
UNKNOWN That was good . 
UNKNOWN This is fine for making a presentat for project presentations. 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah anyway we have the laboratory nearby to build our modules so it's okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN And the leadership was excellent . 
UNKNOWN Yeah I think so . 
UNKNOWN Good job good job . 
UNKNOWN Fine yes uh . 
UNKNOWN He gave you the liberty to talk as you wants . 
UNKNOWN Yeah that's right . 
UNKNOWN Yeah that's right . 
UNKNOWN Uh the teamwork was very very good . 
UNKNOWN Very democratic . 
UNKNOWN I was really I am very satisfying to work with with you . 
THANKS Thank you . 
THANKS Thank you . 
SURPRISE Oh .
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
UNKNOWN And new ideas found . 
UNKNOWN Any new ideas to make these presentationsmore interactive and more interesting ? 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Come up with new product . 
UNKNOWN I mean uh what type of product would you think could we make this more interesting ? 
UNKNOWN Less fancy . 
UNKNOWN Mm we I I know something , we need more cakes , more biscuits on the table while we have meetings . 
UNKNOWN Yeah and also more well uh more seriously I think it's it's a good idea to have uh clear clear points whenever we do a meeting uh prior to the meeting to have uh well a list with the points who will be discussed or things like that , but I think it's alright . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN We achieved uh project goal I think . 
UNKNOWN Yeah that is within the budget . 
UNKNOWN De Without without L_C_D_ , without speech recognition , it will be simple . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN It's w yes , more or less . 
UNKNOWN And the evaluation was Yeah that's right . 
UNKNOWN Yeah but Alright . 
UNKNOWN And the next is celebration . 
UNKNOWN So . 
UNKNOWN So Yeah thank you , thank you very much . 
UNKNOWN So uh coffee machine . 
UNKNOWN Yeah free free coffee . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Alright then , we finished ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah thank you for your work and Okay . 
THANKS Thank you very much . 
UNKNOWN Oops . 
UNKNOWN That's as far as it goes . 
UNKNOWN Hi guys uh good morning everybody here . 
UNKNOWN And uh I want to introduce myself , uh my name is uh Shrida Daseri and uh I'm a project manager for this new project which we are going to discuss now . 
UNKNOWN So I want to introduce first of all uh the names and the colleagues here . 
UNKNOWN And what you're uh drawing? 
UNKNOWN Uh sure my name is Agnes and I'm an user usability user interface designer . 
UNKNOWN My name is Ed and I do accounting . 
UNKNOWN Uh how you spell your name uh ? 
UNKNOWN E_D_ . 
UNKNOWN E_D_ okay . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN And ? 
UNKNOWN Do you also do marketing ? 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN So only accounting ? 
UNKNOWN Accounting , yes . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN And ? 
UNKNOWN And I'm Christine , and my role in this uh scenario is to be the industrial designer . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Industrial designer . 
UNKNOWN But I'm not really one . 
UNKNOWN So who is uh marketing , nobody in the market It's you , okay . 
UNKNOWN Marketing is uh , is me . 
UNKNOWN So thanks for coming for the meeting first of all , and uh we have a long time , just twenty-five minutes to discuss about uh this project and the the project initiation . 
UNKNOWN First of all I want to ask uh Mister Ed about your uh marketing plan and your product plan and uh Mm-hmm but uh do you already have like a functional design or a technical design or Oh for the moment not yet , okay , but uh what's what's your uh do you have some project plan , something with you or Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Well I think that we'll see that throughout the day in how we're going to put this together as a marketing to to market the product . 
UNKNOWN We'll have to see on a through discussion on where we're gonna go from here and from with this . 
UNKNOWN Uh for the moment not yet . 
UNKNOWN Good question . 
UNKNOWN No , this is like I said that we have to be discussed between all of us and we'll go from there . 
UNKNOWN We'll have to simply we'll have to work on it together . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so uh by when you think you can uh give me some kind of uh project plan , okay , a discussion with uh By next meeting , okay that will be great . 
UNKNOWN Certainly by the next meeting . 
UNKNOWN Uh Okay , so there's any questions or uh first of all about uh this project ? 
UNKNOWN What is the goal of the project ? 
UNKNOWN Uh the goal of the project I think maybe I'll uh hand out to the Ed , okay , so to explain uh what is the project because he's in the sales and the accounting . 
UNKNOWN I'm in the sales I'm supposed to explain them what to do . 
UNKNOWN We have to define exactly what our product is , from uh From what I had in mind we're supposed to be marketing coffee , is that right ? 
UNKNOWN Yes , so can you explain uh what exactly the product is ? 
UNKNOWN Oh I think uh , if I'm not wrong , we're making the remote control . 
UNKNOWN Um I was wondering Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Remote controls , 'cause I had two different things . 
UNKNOWN I had a first part of mine was to make a remote control for a new f remote control for television , and afterward I had a discussion about coffee so we'll start with the remote control for television then . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN So we're have to design something that is very user friendly . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Something uh visual that has something that will will drawpeople to buy the product , because I think everybody's experienced with uh remote controls , and some remote controls are are worth uh throwing out the window . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Uh th most of them ar I don't know we're have to come up with a new idea on how to make it a lot easier to use , 'cause a lot of times uh spend uh half a day through the instruction booktrying to figure out how to use it . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN And uh what abo uh Christine , what about your uh the industrial design plan ? 
UNKNOWN Are you have a design already on this product or uh you're still working on the design ? 
UNKNOWN Um no , I I have not begun working on the design , and um I uh I actually didn't know we were designing a remote control , I thought we were designing a new monitor . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um the website I went to look at had some announcements about an introduction of a um uh some sort of a seven inch um monitor , and um I understood that that was the project goal . 
UNKNOWN So um I'm glad I didn't d do any work um ahead of time because uh I clearly didn't understand the project goal . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um I just did s see that we were starting a new project together and there was going to be a four member team composed of these people , and um that's about uh that's and I I read through the different steps , and what my responsibilities were relative to the steps . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So uh you'll be leading the team for your design team or how many members is working in the team , for the design ? 
UNKNOWN Uh for the industrial design ? 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN Um well , I would th think that depends on how much money you give us . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN That's Yeah , but uh before we talk about uh the finance , okay , uh do you have some idea how we can uh sell this product or project in the market and how much is going to benefit to the company and uh of course it's to the individual also . 
UNKNOWN Um because uh , you know , you can uh you can make it uh you have different choices with different financial models . 
UNKNOWN Well , you know um , I kind of think that in general you have to do uh um y you have to have something that's very fashionable , that's uh very attractive that um people see and recognize uh its goal , and uh they immediately wanna have it uh have one of their own . 
UNKNOWN So it would really would need to um something like the iPod would be good , seems to have caught on fairly well , so um d uh you know , I don't care what it does , just so it looks cool . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Okay , but uh uh when you think you can give me like a kind of design on the functional design or the technical design ? 
UNKNOWN Well , uh I've got a lot of other projects I'm doing right now um and so I'll have to wait and see how those uh how those go . 
UNKNOWN If they uh go quickly then uh it could be a month . 
UNKNOWN If um if I run into any problems in my other projects it might be six months . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but uh I need something in the writing , so like uh what's your functional design , what's your technical design , and uh how many people you need for this project , and what's the time frame you're looking , okay , and what is the budget , maybe uh initial budget you're looking , okay , and uh how is going to the market , okay , so you've you've had to meet with the marketing team and how they're going to market and what are the marketing strategic plan , okay , when are you going to introduce , okay , and by the time you introduce the product and uh you know there there would be a competition , okay , so I need some kind of uh uh the plan in the writing from you . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Okay , and it's po B as soon as possible . 
UNKNOWN And when would you like that ? 
UNKNOWN Uh well if uh if we have enough time uh then d do you think um two weeks is a is close enough ? 
UNKNOWN Yes I think uh that would be good , because I need to go to the management and uh tell them what we are going to do , and uh what cost is , okay , and what's the time frame and what's the project plan , because uh without any uh documentations, I cannot go to the management and say , so we are going to do this and we need this much money , okay , so then it's it's difficult for me to say , okay , that's the reason I need uh some kind of plan from you , initially , okay , then we can have the further discussion again . 
UNKNOWN Uh are there other people who will be contributing to the plan ? 
UNKNOWN Yes , of course , if you need some help , uh so let me know . 
UNKNOWN So , who are the people you need uh from the marketing or uh the technical side or uh the administration point of view , okay , to add in any documentation, or some technical point of view , so just let me know so I can uh coordinate all the teams . 
UNKNOWN Okay , I'll get back to you on that . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
THANKS Thank you . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN And uh Ed uh so what's what do you think about uh this uh project for the remote control and d do you have some already planned something for your marketing strategy or uh the sales strategy ? 
UNKNOWN Well not yet other than uh doing research and taking remote controls and looking what other companies have to do uh , what they're building , their designs, their ideas , uh also have to pinpoint which market we're gonna go into . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN It should be a fairly large market because uh the number of people that uh the competition , uh th I agree it has to be something it has to be something new , it has to be something that that draws people saying eh , I like this . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Whether it works or not , they have to first say I like this , I like the design , and then it's gotta be simple to use . 
UNKNOWN Yes , so what I uh prefer maybe uh you need to interact uh more with the Christine , okay , because you know what she is going to do it , okay , and you know how to sell it . 
UNKNOWN Okay , because uh she is doing the design , but you are the core because you are in the marketing , okay , so because you need to sell and you're the responsible for the all the money , the finance , okay , tomorrow . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So , what I prefer , okay , so you need to interact with the Christine more and uh within her team , okay , who is using the functional design or technical design , okay , and uh you need to come up with some kind of plan , okay , how we are going to do the your sales plan , okay , th Th That that's Yes , that's you have to decide , okay , so the best thing is you uh both of uh the Christine and you discuss with yourself , okay , and come up with the cost , and how we are going to compete in the market , okay , in the the technically , or in the sales wise , okay , the commercial wise , okay . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Do we already have a cost limit on this , th an idea of how much uh we want to market this for , how much it's gonna sell for , that's up that's up to us to decide , eh ? 
UNKNOWN Then uh we have to design , okay , how long it will take the whole project , okay , how much is going to cost us , and how much we are going to benefit for the company . 
UNKNOWN Okay , of course it's it's uh of benefit for everybody individually . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so I think it's uh maybe if we can uh give me some kind of your uh the sales plan , okay , including the technical what uh she's going to talk to you within the team , okay , then it will help me to discuss with the management for further , okay , and put it in the the proper project plan . 
UNKNOWN Okay , and if you need uh any coordination in between uh compared to the maybe the some technical vendors or commercial vendors , okay , depends if you want to have some uh uh marketing plan or technical plan , okay , so you let me know . 
CONFIRMATION Very good . 
UNKNOWN Okay , I can coordinate , or maybe uh , you are my coordinator , am I right ? 
CONFIRMATION Very good . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Between uh all the coor Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well , no , not exactly . 
UNKNOWN I mean my job from what I understood was to look at the usability requirements and make sure that the product is usable , it's acceptable to the people who are gonna use it and look at the best ways to do that . 
UNKNOWN So I think I'll have to interact with Christine and discuss with her , so that she's not designing something that my studies will show right off the bat that it's not going to work , and so it's sort of it's a loop that feeds in , but I don't think necessarily that I'm in a coordinating position for it . 
UNKNOWN Th Christine , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Which is Yes . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , so basically you need to interact with Christine more , okay , for the user acceptability , okay , and the testing , okay , then you will Yes . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Which will also feed into the marketing , because depending on what users want , depends on how you sell it , what tag lines you attach to it , how you try to make it more attractive to users . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So I think all three groups will need to interact quite a bit . 
UNKNOWN Um , and then I guess build the plan based on all of that , because I think you need to take all the factors into account . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN But what I request , okay , keep Ed in the loop , okay , in between your uh meeting and Christine meeting , because uh he should know what's happening . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , of course . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , we can C_C_ him on any discussions or documentsthat are passed around . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN Okay and please please copyall the mails , okay , all the discussions to me , okay , so I need to submit to the management . 
CONFIRMATION Sure . 
UNKNOWN No problem . 
UNKNOWN So any questions for uh time being ? 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN So , the immediate next step is to start determining the functional design , or okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN To come up with the functional design and uh to discuss with Ed , okay , and how it's going to be work , and uh first of all with your user acceptance , okay , how it looks like and how it's going to be work in the market , okay , so then we can discuss about uh further things . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So , we'll meet when the we'll discuss on the further meeting . 
UNKNOWN It's okay ? 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Thanks for coming . 
UNKNOWN Would you mind um at the conclusion of our meeting could could you send us a copyof your slides? 
UNKNOWN Yes , I will . 
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm , yeah , that would be useful . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN I'll copy, uh le let us keep all the emails and all the copies, okay , share each other , okay , so you know everybody what's happening , okay ? 
CONFIRMATION Sure . 
UNKNOWN And if anything you need anytime so please either you can call me , or just send me email, or uh just come and uh knock my door , okay , so I'm available here . 
UNKNOWN It's good ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Okay , thanks for coming and uh I wish you a nice time then . 
THANKS Thank you . 
CONFIRMATION Thanks . 
THANKS Thank you . 
UNKNOWN Okay , see you later . 
FAREWELL Bye . 
UNKNOWN Okay uh Agnes , you can help me for the slidewhen okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
CONFIRMATION Sure . 
UNKNOWN Okay , welcome back . 
UNKNOWN I hope uh you have a fresh head and a fresh time . 
UNKNOWN How t now the meeting actually we gathering here to discuss about the functional design meeting . 
UNKNOWN Okay , and uh we'll issue some information from uh all of you . 
UNKNOWN And it's in the , I think uh , in the sharing folder . 
UNKNOWN And uh I will invite uh the Christine and the Ed and uh Agnes to discuss about on the various subjects . 
UNKNOWN So can you go to the next slide? 
UNKNOWN Yeah uh the agendaof the meeting is opening . 
UNKNOWN Then uh I'm going to talk about uh the project management , what I'm going to do , and uh , of course , I'm doing the project management and secretary both , okay , to take the minutesof the meeting . 
UNKNOWN And there are three presentations. 
UNKNOWN One is uh new project requirements . 
UNKNOWN And the second one about uh decision on remote control functions . 
UNKNOWN And uh finally we are closing . 
UNKNOWN Uh and the meeting time will be uh forty minutes , so you have to be very quick . 
UNKNOWN And I have come up with the management come with the new proposal , okay , and I have to discuss a few points on this . 
UNKNOWN Uh both says new insights in the aim of your project . 
UNKNOWN Uh the one is uh the teletext becomes uh outmoded , okay because if uh because of the computer systems and the new technology . 
UNKNOWN So we don't need to consider really about the teletext all in our new project design . 
UNKNOWN And the second one is about uh the remote control . 
UNKNOWN Should be used only for the T_V_ . 
UNKNOWN That's what our uh management says . 
UNKNOWN And the third point , it's very very important to establish our uh marketing or uh corporate image , okay , with this new project or new product . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So I will invite uh Agnes , can you go to the third slide? 
UNKNOWN No , this is the third slide. 
UNKNOWN Okay , . 
UNKNOWN So , I'll invite uh Christine to discuss about uh the functional design . 
UNKNOWN 'Kay , do you wanna open the I'm number two . 
CONFIRMATION Sure . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN You're participant s Two ? 
UNKNOWN That's it . 
UNKNOWN Do you want the mouse , or do you want me to Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN I'll do the notes. 
UNKNOWN Yeah , thanks . 
UNKNOWN So um well I I figured uh we should um identify some user requirements , and from my experience , I wanna uh , and from research I did , uh the the device has to turn the television on and off the first time you press on the big button , you can't uh can't have like uh waffling on this point , you know . 
UNKNOWN Really have It needs to be able y y have to be able to find it . 
UNKNOWN Because one of the biggest problems with remote controls is finding them . 
UNKNOWN So uh , I also , since we have to establish our corporate image on the basis of this new product , thought we better look at things that are popular and um ex go beyond those , and , as I said in the first meeting , um and then uh we might wanna talk eventually about the materials that are appropriate to use in uh in the construction , especially in the the uh the outside of the product so that it gives the appearance , and it is reliable , and so forth . 
UNKNOWN I did a little history on uh the the uh remote controls and when they were invented and so forth , so , I guess this guy Zenith uh created the Flashmatic , which I kinda like the idea , 'cause it made me think of um um maybe the remote control made a big flash when uh you turn the T_V_ on and off , that might be interesting . 
UNKNOWN And um so it was highly directional flash light that uh you could turn the picture on and off , and the sound on and off , and change channels c so I think um those are still requirements we have today , uh fifty years later . 
UNKNOWN And uh it was really a pioneering innovation , but it was uh sensitive to the sun , so that uh it would get would start off by the you'd get it would easily cause um problems . 
UNKNOWN So , uh I in addition to uh looking at the um uh the functional requir so all these devices are examples of where uh mm they represent examples that are available today which I think the one in the middle is r um really uh something to keep in mind . 
UNKNOWN Fantastic . 
UNKNOWN It'd be easy to find . 
UNKNOWN And um it would uh y you'd you could throw it at things if if the T_V_ didn't turn on and off , you could use it for something else . 
UNKNOWN And since I'm not really um Industrial Designer , I didn't really know what to do with this slide. 
UNKNOWN But um I just took some different uh schematics and I put them into this , and I guess this is what a slidemight look like if you were drawinga circuit board . 
UNKNOWN I don't know why um we were asked to do this . 
UNKNOWN So , uh personal preferences , um I think we could uh I I'm really thinking outside the box here , and I think that we should consider perhaps having an an an a a size uh a remote control that changes in size depending on the user preference . 
UNKNOWN So something that's very very flexible and inflatable and then you could shrink it . 
UNKNOWN I think um it could either be you could go either one extreme , be very colourful , or you could make it clear , and um kind of blend in with things , so you didn't have to um uh have a problem with the th the decoration of the of the user's home . 
UNKNOWN Um I think uh it needs to be waterproof , because uh sometimes they fall into cups and , you know , it might be out by the swimming pool or something like that . 
UNKNOWN Um if you uh mi one of one of my requirements was about needs t to tell you when it's done its job or not , because half the time , I keep pushing on the remote control , and I don't know if it's actually understood my message , so I think it should give you some sort of an oral cue . 
UNKNOWN And uh , course I never wanna replace the battery . 
UNKNOWN So , that's those are my f preferences , and that's my presentation. 
UNKNOWN Yeah , let me uh interrupt you uh if you can add other facility , other feature , like uh unbreakable . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN Okay , because uh especially today , you know , you have the family and the kids , okay , and the kids throw it and they they play with their remotes and . 
UNKNOWN Run over it with a car . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so if you can add the feature , okay , for your uh fabric whatever in your outline design okay , with unbreakable , okay , I think that will give a lot of advantage for our product , if I'm not wrong . 
UNKNOWN Good idea . 
UNKNOWN Good idea , I'll I'll uh um Yes , very good . 
UNKNOWN Maybe you can uh add it in that . 
UNKNOWN Okay , uh thank you Christine , and uh uh any questions or uh clarifications , or any discussion on the functional design ? 
UNKNOWN Do you have any preconceived ideas in terms of materials ? 
UNKNOWN 'Cause , for example , in the unbreakable thing , doing something plastic would be harder , whereas having something like , I dunno , steel or titanium isn't really economically viable . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Titanium . 
UNKNOWN Titanium would be be heavy , too , wouldn't it ? 
UNKNOWN Titanium . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN No , I haven't really um I wanted feedback , I think we need to rate rank these , but we'll see what your uh personal preferences are and your thoughts . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Sure , yeah . 
UNKNOWN No , I just wondering whether that you had any sort of Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I like titanium . 
UNKNOWN It's light . 
UNKNOWN Expensive . 
UNKNOWN Uh yeah but uh who who said who said we were , you know , nobody told me how mu what our financial objective is , so um It'd be hard to inflate something ou made out of titanium though . 
UNKNOWN The marketing comes out . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN Yeah so Yeah the the I'm sorry because uh the last meeting we supposed to discuss about the financial thing . 
UNKNOWN Uh let me go quickly , maybe if I can go back . 
UNKNOWN I know the project plan and the budget . 
UNKNOWN So I can close this , not sure . 
UNKNOWN Was in uh S This . 
UNKNOWN So let me see where is this file. 
UNKNOWN That's Christine's . 
UNKNOWN This is Christine . 
UNKNOWN And that's mine , I think . 
UNKNOWN That's yours , okay . 
UNKNOWN Saving . 
UNKNOWN In modified . 
UNKNOWN I don't know , I think verbally we can we can pretty much sell . 
UNKNOWN Okay , uh I will I will send you a mail, okay ? 
UNKNOWN The project may be the the project aim , okay . 
UNKNOWN At the end of the day , the company uh wants to make at least uh the fifty million Euro . 
UNKNOWN Okay , and uh of course the price will be very reasonable on the the sales side . 
UNKNOWN Okay , that maybe Eddie will talk to you about uh how much uh the price and uh what's uh how much its cost for the manufacturing and how much it's going to be we sell in the market . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Then uh you can come back with your feedback . 
UNKNOWN And I I have one maybe the suggestion or opinion . 
UNKNOWN This remote control , okay , it can be for like universal , to use for any T_V_ . 
UNKNOWN Okay , and it will be slim , okay , and uh Not fat . 
UNKNOWN Not fat ? 
UNKNOWN Not fat , huh . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Might be hard to find , though . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN But let's try it , okay , with the different uh the designs, okay , the functional designs. 
CONFIRMATION Oh , okay . 
UNKNOWN Okay ? 
UNKNOWN So any other questions ? 
UNKNOWN Uh from her side , I don't think uh there's too many more questions . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN If you can come to the Okay , from the marketing yeah , from the marketing side , just to to give an idea what the management is looking for , I was looking for a a remote control to have a s I have a sales price of twenty-five Euro , with a production price of uh twelve and a half Euro . 
THANKS Thank you Christine for uh time being , so then uh Ed , so can you tell about Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN S 'scuse me for one sec . 
UNKNOWN For what uh I think from what we're trying to find , we're tr we're looking for , I don't think that price is exactly in the market . 
UNKNOWN Okay ? 
UNKNOWN I'll explain myself here now in the sense that uh in a in the recent surveys , uh from the ages fr from fifteen to thirty-five , eighty percent are willing to spend more money for something as fancy as trendy . 
UNKNOWN Twenty-five Euros , uh that's that's a preson reasonable price . 
UNKNOWN That's a market price right now . 
UNKNOWN Now if we're gonna take a risk , and push this up a bit , make it more expensive , but give them added things that they don't have now , then it w it could possibly sell . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN Obviously the risk is there . 
UNKNOWN Too expensive , they're not gonna buy . 
UNKNOWN But , I think uh there's one other thing interesting two things that are interesting is that uh from the fifteen to thirty-five year-old group , which always spends more money on trendy new things , speech recognition is requested . 
UNKNOWN And we're talking between seventy-five to ninety percent of this group is willing to pay for speech recognition on a remote . 
UNKNOWN Speech recognition? . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Obviously , we can't make a remote into a computer , but maybe simple commands . 
UNKNOWN I dunno , louder , softer , on , off . 
UNKNOWN That might be a possibility , even though it costs more , to be the first on the market to produce this . 
UNKNOWN Thirty-five percent say they're too difficult to use . 
UNKNOWN So we have to figure out a way of making it um more user friendly . 
UNKNOWN Uh fifty percent say they can't find the remote half the time . 
UNKNOWN So maybe one word speech recognition commands , say remote , and there's a beep beep beep , and they can find it through , you know , ten tons of newspapers , magazines , whatever you have at home . 
UNKNOWN But , in the cost that uh the management is looking for , that's not gonna be possible . 
UNKNOWN But if it's trendy , if it's fancy , it's got some colour to it , if it's very easy easy to use , if it's got simple remote speech remote uh control , like I said , louder , softer , change channel , on , off , remote , it goes beep beep , I can find my my remote without spending half a day looking for it and getting all upset 'cause I can't turn the T_V_ on . 
UNKNOWN So we're gonna have to look at it in a in this global idea , with the ideas of the industrial uh design . 
UNKNOWN But , price obviously we have to talk about . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN So what do you think about uh the design ? 
UNKNOWN Do you think you can make it or uh What do you think about uh the design , uh what he was talking about of the speech recognition ? 
UNKNOWN D uh I'm sorry ? 
UNKNOWN Speech recognition . 
UNKNOWN Well , uh training is always an issue with uh commands . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So um might uh we can perhaps um do it if the user is willing to spend some time in the training process , uh it could reduce th th uh the overall um cost . 
UNKNOWN Not sure how . 
UNKNOWN But um anyway , um I I think also that uh this might impact the battery life . 
UNKNOWN And um so , maybe what we'll have to do is um add something where you can um recharge it wirelessly so that uh y you know sen send power to it . 
UNKNOWN So uh or maybe uh set it out in the sun and it uh , you know , gets uh , from the light , um a a solar cell inside there so that uh you have enough uh juice to do all these fancy things . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN It seems also like with the speech recognition , yeah , it's a great feature , but if you're watching T_V_ , there's a lot of ambient sound , and it's words . 
UNKNOWN It's not just , you know , noises like something hitting . 
UNKNOWN It's actual speech , so then you have to make sure that the speech recognizer is good enough to filter out the T_V_ speech , and the the user's speech . 
UNKNOWN Otherwise , you can say remote . 
UNKNOWN Off . 
UNKNOWN But if someone on the screen is saying the same thing , all of a sudden , you have someone in a movie saying off and your screen dies , because they've triggered the remote control and it's turned off your T_V_ . 
UNKNOWN So , I think if we can find a speech recognizer that can handle those types of problems , then yeah , it'd be a really good marketing gimmick . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN But , I think we seriously need to consider how that would impact the situation . 
UNKNOWN Very good point . 
UNKNOWN Because tha w with speech recognition uh th I'm not that good at that idea but th if it's a one-word recognition , 'cause I know with telephones and cars and things I've seen in the States , a friend of mine says call Mom , and it calls up Mom . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN 'Kay the radio can be on and everything . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN Because I think s with speech recognition , if uh the the remote or like the telephone it has a exact word that it has to hear . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN I don't think it would come through a sentence in a television . 
UNKNOWN If somebody's speaking on the se the television , they're not gonna stop and say remote , okay . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So I think that uh something could be designed to recognise single word Like the t like the telephone . 
UNKNOWN Oh yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN No , I think it's a great idea if we can design it to to suit those requirements . 
UNKNOWN No because I this is this is years ago in the United States where we're driving down and he said call home , and the telephone called immediately so well , that's kinda cute . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well , what I can uh suggest to you , Christine , okay , uh if you need some uh the technical feedback , or some training , okay , about uh this facility , especially for the speech recognition , I can recommend you some companies like uh Intel or I_B_M_ , okay , because they're already in this uh speech recognition part , okay . 
UNKNOWN And uh you can maybe have some uh technical backup from them , some kind of a technical tie-up . 
UNKNOWN Okay , and uh if you want , I can coordinate , okay , to get some information , okay , and uh you can uh let me know , okay , so what kind of uh the details you require okay , to add this feature in this project . 
UNKNOWN I don't think it's uh the difficult . 
UNKNOWN And uh we need to know how much is the timeframe you need to develop , apart from uh what today . 
UNKNOWN Okay , we'll find that out . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN From from your side uh , you're gonna have to go back the management and s be more s precise . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN What do they want ? 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN Uh , a risk , take a risk on the market ? 
UNKNOWN Something that's gonna cost more , but could very easily s make a boom in the market ? 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN Because it has to be something totally different , has to be total totally new . 
UNKNOWN Something that nobody has right now . 
UNKNOWN Yeah but but end of the day , you're the sales guy , so I will come back and sit on your head because uh you are going to give your sales projection , okay . 
UNKNOWN And it's gonna cost . 
UNKNOWN It's uh of course it's uh good to uh tell the management how much it's cost us and how much you are going to benefit , okay . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Sure . 
CONFIRMATION Sure . 
UNKNOWN And uh , so I don't mind to convince , okay , the management to spend some more money on the project , okay , if you can make out of the money from this project . 
UNKNOWN Obviously . 
UNKNOWN If the bottom line is positive . 
UNKNOWN Yes , okay I don't mind to convince the the management , okay . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN The management says , okay , so they they don't want certain facilities , which it's already worked , okay , they want something uh new , okay . 
UNKNOWN I think uh like uh speech recognit definitely they will agree , I don't think they'll say no for that , okay . 
UNKNOWN And uh I hope I can convince the management on that , okay . 
UNKNOWN So if you have any uh new ideas , okay , for uh your you can always come up and uh you can tell me if you need any uh s special , okay , coordination , okay , between any uh technical companies , which you can uh hide their technology backup , okay , for your uh functional design or technical design , okay , then I am ready to do that . 
UNKNOWN And uh what's your comments about uh Yeah , so you are finish , Ed , uh so I can uh Okay , I'll uh hand over to Agnes . 
UNKNOWN Um well , I mean , maybe if I go through my presentation, you can sort of see what the user perspective is , and how it ties into the other two comments . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Just gonna close this . 
UNKNOWN T Uh where are you , here ? 
UNKNOWN Mm participant three . 
UNKNOWN Participant three . 
UNKNOWN Nope , here Good . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so I'll yep . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Thanks . 
UNKNOWN Is it okay ? 
UNKNOWN Alri Click mm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , and that's fine . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So , basically , the method that we usually use in the user interface design is that we need to look at what people like and what people don't like about existing products . 
UNKNOWN So , in our case , existing remote controls . 
UNKNOWN And then , what the good ideas are , and what the bad ideas are , and why they're bad and good , which isn't always as obvious . 
UNKNOWN We seem to have intuitions about why things are good or things are bad , but when you look , technically , at how it works , sometimes that's not the case . 
UNKNOWN Then we need to decide what functionalities we really want to keep , 'cause that'll feed into both Ed's work and Christine's work . 
UNKNOWN Um and then what the remote control should look like , obviously , once we've got a good idea of what the functionalities are . 
UNKNOWN So , in terms of the functionalities that we need , you obviously need to be able to turn the T_V_ on and off . 
UNKNOWN You need to change channels , both by directly going to a specific channel or by channel surfing . 
UNKNOWN You need to be able to control the volume and then control any menus on the T_V_ to regulate contrast or whatever . 
UNKNOWN So , the problems that people have expressed is that there's too many buttons on remote controls , in general . 
UNKNOWN The buttons it's not clear what they're supposed to do . 
UNKNOWN Um often , you need to know specific button sequences to get certain functionalities done , um which you don't necessarily always remember , especially if it's a functionality that you don't use very often . 
UNKNOWN And that the buttons are too small . 
UNKNOWN So , here we've got two examples where here on the left-hand side , you can see a remote control that has lots and lots of buttons . 
UNKNOWN The buttons , in a lot of cases , are tiny . 
UNKNOWN Um they're hard to see , and okay , they're labelled , but the labels don't necessarily tell you too much . 
UNKNOWN Whereas , on the other side , you have a much simpler remote control that I think basically has the minimum functionalities that are needed . 
UNKNOWN And it sort of looks simpler and just less imposing when you first look at it . 
UNKNOWN So , I would be inclined to go sort of towards this , in terms of design , rather than this . 
UNKNOWN And if there's specific functionalities that require more buttons , then we can figure out how to do it with existing um buttons . 
UNKNOWN So my personal preferences are to keep the number of buttons to a limit , or to a minimum , sorry , make frequently used buttons bigger and more strategically placed , so like the on button being really obvious one , the channel changing and the volume , and to keep the design basically sleek and simple . 
UNKNOWN Which , I think ties into what Christine and Ed have both said fairly reasonably . 
UNKNOWN Um so , that's pretty much it , an I don't know if you guys have any questions or Yep . 
UNKNOWN Oh , it's um , seems very understandable . 
UNKNOWN Clearly your research and uh and ours uh heading in the same direction , and um uh the only thing that I saw missing from uh your your research that we found was this uh ability to find the doggone thing when you need it . 
UNKNOWN Yes , that's true . 
UNKNOWN So uh , you know , but that's okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN That's why we're all here at the table , so that if we think of it and our research indicates certain things and um w we it's complementary . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I also think that um uh th f the the feel of it is uh , when you hold it , is something that um uh was expressed more in in in in my uh design and that's logical and normal 'cause those are the parameters that an Industrial Designer's more thinking about , th th the look and the feel , and uh , you're First . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Oh , that's definitely a very important factor , especially to users who are gonna be buying the thing and then using it almost on an daily basis in a lot of cases , I think . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so I don't have any questions . 
UNKNOWN Sounds good . 
UNKNOWN So for anybody need uh any help , for time being , on this uh subjects , okay , so please come back to me , and uh Christine , maybe I can uh try to help you to get some uh the technical uh the companies to help you for uh make a design uh slim , okay , and to add some features , like we are talking about , the speech recognition and all . 
UNKNOWN Oh Should we maybe make a decision about what features we actually want to include , 'cause we've thrown a lot of features onto the table , but do we actually want to incorporate all of them , or have we missed anything ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Do you wanna go back and look at the closing slide, maybe that would provide some guidance ? 
CONFIRMATION Sure . 
UNKNOWN Doesn't really tell us . 
UNKNOWN So not really this one we are talk ab Yep . 
UNKNOWN Individual actions . 
UNKNOWN Well it says individual actions , it says user interf so I'm supposed to do the components concept , supposed to work on the user interface concept , and you're supposed to keep watching the trends . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um and specific instructions will be sent by our our coach . 
UNKNOWN I think we should do as many features as uh start with all of them right now and eliminate them later in the process , that's my suggestion . 
UNKNOWN I thought No , I I'm just thinking in terms of time , like if Yes , now I'm objecting . 
UNKNOWN Okay , that will be great . 
UNKNOWN And uh I'll send you the the minutesof meet Yeah . 
UNKNOWN You can object if you want to I think we should take that as an action item for after the meeting , 'cause w our meeting time has run out . 
UNKNOWN She's objecting . 
UNKNOWN No , I mean , I was just thinking is it really practical to start designing something with features that we're just gonna end up throwing away ? 
UNKNOWN I mean , it takes a lot of time and effort for everyone to consider different features , um and s if we spend that time and effort on features that we're not gonna use , maybe it's better to spend it on the f thinking more about features that we actually do want , but I guess Sure . 
UNKNOWN Oh th we s we still have Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Somebody else has go to use this room , and , you know , we can't hang out here and talk about this , so Thank you very much . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Sure . 
UNKNOWN Okay , what we'll do is now we'll take for lunch break , okay , then uh we can discuss furthermore , okay , with our areas , and uh then we will come back again in the in the next meeting . 
UNKNOWN So thanks for coming and uh I'll send you minutesof meeting , and uh please put your all information in the sharing folder so everybody can share the information . 
UNKNOWN Okay ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So let's go for lunch then . 
UNKNOWN Agreed . 
THANKS Thank you . 
UNKNOWN Uh welcome back after lunch , I hope uh you had a good lunch together . 
UNKNOWN For uh this meeting the main agendaokay uh to discuss about the conceptual design meeting . 
UNKNOWN Okay and the agendawill be the opening and uh that's uh the product manager or secretary that's me and uh the presentationsfrom the Christine and uh Agnes and from Mister Ed . 
UNKNOWN And finally in this meeting we have to decide and we are to take a decision on the remote control concept and uh the functional design So we have forty minutes , I think it's uh little bit uh low , but I I hope we can finish it up so I'll handle to the the functional team , to the Christine , okay , to discuss about uh the components concept . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So uh , if you could open the PowerPoint presentation. 
UNKNOWN I'm number two . 
UNKNOWN You're number two . 
UNKNOWN 'Kay The next one . 
UNKNOWN Components design , there we go . 
UNKNOWN So uh can we put it in slideshow mode ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Right here , is that little that one , yes please . 
THANKS Thank you . 
UNKNOWN I'll take the mouse . 
UNKNOWN So uh we were looking he specifically at the components uh the following components , uh the case , the power supply , uh the means of communications with the television set . 
UNKNOWN In instance we had talked about using some sort of speech recognition , you have to have microphone well no you don't actually I haven't have to have microphone in the device , but um maybe you do have it a a way it has to it has to hear the speaker and um , so it could be in the television set , could be in the device , but somewhere you have to put the microphone , um and a w a way of making beeps or sounds so you can find it when it's gets lost . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um so the other w thing that we So . 
UNKNOWN Our method for going about this is we've looked at uh the histo hi historical record , what's worked , what hasn't and then we also um we wanted to evaluate some new materials and we contacted manufacturing for their input because , course , we m might come up and choose the material that then manufacturing didn't have the technologies or capabilities to offer us , so uh this is the approach that we took during our um our research . 
UNKNOWN So um for the case , um we told we were making a specifica specific assumption that it would be curved in design . 
UNKNOWN Course , you know , I wanted it to be expandable and shrinkable , but um that uh doesn't seem to b be one of the choic non-option we can uh we can really seriously explore , so then we were thinking about um rubber , but um unfortunately that's been eliminated because of the heat uh factor and th um there might be some problems with the m uh how it's uh goes with the board . 
UNKNOWN Uh and uh then th plastic also has this problem of melting and it's brittle it gets brittle after a while , so um we still had titanium and and wood available , but um unfortunately uh uh titanium's also been eliminated uh , the m people in manufacturing said that you couldn't make d curved cases out of titanium , although how Apple did it with th PowerBook I'm not su quite sure but uh nevertheless um they've eliminated all of our options except wood . 
UNKNOWN So , this is our finding . 
UNKNOWN At least it's environmentally friendly . 
UNKNOWN And a as she said , it's an environmentally friendly uh material , so we're we're currently uh proposing , uh we'll get to all my personal preferences in just a second . 
UNKNOWN So then there's this other matter of the chips and um well we could use a simple design on the board , but uh these simple chips , but that's only works for the bu you don't get very much um intelligence with this simple one . 
UNKNOWN And um then there was the regular which I regret that I've forgotten exactly why I'm eliminating that one . 
UNKNOWN Uh the other option was this advanced chip on print, and uh we liked th we we found that it it includes this infrared sender , which w 'member the beam was that was an important component of finding the right chip . 
UNKNOWN And uh manufacturing has told us that they've um uh recently developed a uh a sensor and a speaker that would uh be integrated into this advanced chip on print, so uh we we uh now jumping right to our personal preferences um I I'd really think we should , you know , use some of uh some really exotic woods , like um , you know uh , well you guys come from tropical countries so you can kinda think of some trees and some nice woods . 
UNKNOWN I think that people will might really want to design their own cases , you see , they could do sort of a this um three-dimensional design on the internet , and then they could submit their orders , kinda like you submit a custom car order , you know , and you can choose the colour and the size of the wheels and the colours of the leather and things like that , and then I uh think we should go with the solar cells as well as the um microphone and speaker on the advanced chip . 
UNKNOWN So this is the findings of our research and my recommendations um for the new remote control w um would be to have um have it be made out of wood . 
UNKNOWN Do you have any problems with that ? 
UNKNOWN Can you go back uh one slide? 
UNKNOWN I'm not sure , how do I Oh , I know , let's see . 
THANKS Thank you . 
UNKNOWN Let's go back up here . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yes , uh question , uh , what's mean exactly , advanced chip on print? 
UNKNOWN What's the meaning of that ? 
UNKNOWN I think it's um um a multiple uh chip design um and it's uh maybe printed on to the circuit board . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Uh I could find out more about that uh before the next fi next meeting . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , is it means it's on the yeah is it on a micro-proc micro-processor based or uh Okay , tha that would be great , so if you find out from the technology background , okay , so that would be good . 
UNKNOWN I don't know , but I'll find out more at our next meeting . 
UNKNOWN Sounds good . 
UNKNOWN Why was the plastic eliminated as a possible material ? 
UNKNOWN Because um it gets brittle , cracks Um We want we expect these um uh these remote controls to be around for several hundred years . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So . 
UNKNOWN Good ex Good expression . 
UNKNOWN Whic Which Although I think I think with wood though you'd run into the same types of problems , wouldn't you , I mean it chips , it if you drop it , uh it's I'm not su I think if you re if you use really good quality wood , then it might work , but you can't just use Yeah , exactly , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Wow , good expression . 
UNKNOWN Well after us . 
UNKNOWN I don't know , speak for yourself , I'm planning to be around for a while . 
UNKNOWN So so you're not convinced about the the wood , yes . 
UNKNOWN Actually , I'm ready to sell it . 
UNKNOWN you're what ? 
UNKNOWN I'm ready to sell it . 
UNKNOWN You think ? 
UNKNOWN No y no no no , the o the only w the only wood you can use are the ones that are hard , extremely hard wood , but there are some very pretty woods out there . 
UNKNOWN And you could you could sell oils with it , to take care of it . 
UNKNOWN Well I'm glad you Okay , good . 
UNKNOWN That's actually very innovative idea . 
UNKNOWN Sorr having a hard time keeping wi control over my face . 
UNKNOWN Well , it's actually a very innovative n different idea that uh you know you can choose your colour of wood , your type of wood . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN The stain . 
UNKNOWN I mean it's each person is gonna have their own personalised , individualised speech recognition remote control in wood , that's not on the market . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , so it it's looks good the the design the functional design uh , what about yo you ? 
UNKNOWN Um , in terms of comments on this or in terms of my own Y yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yes , in t yes , in term in terms of comments first Okay then , uh , let's move to Agnes . 
UNKNOWN In turns of wow . 
UNKNOWN She works in the cubicle next to me so she's uh she was already a little bit prepared for this . 
UNKNOWN Luckily Ed was not . 
UNKNOWN Wood ? 
UNKNOWN I think we can get the quality materials then it shouldn't influence the design principles too much , which you'll see with my presentation. 
UNKNOWN One thing we'd have to check though is what the users whether how quickly the novelty wears off of having uh Yeah , for example . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , you wouldn't wanna have to have splinters in your hand while you're using your It's really good if your dog gets ahold of it , they can use it for teething . 
UNKNOWN So , have to see how kid-friendly it is and and all that , but Sure . 
UNKNOWN They do that anyway with the rubber and plastic , so , and chew 'em up . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , they do it with other materials as well , yeah . 
UNKNOWN And chew 'em up . 
UNKNOWN Oh , I'm sorry . 
UNKNOWN S you're You are in participant three . 
UNKNOWN One point three , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh , yeah . 
UNKNOWN This one ? 
UNKNOWN I think so , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's the one . 
UNKNOWN So , it's a very short presentation, 'cause I'm actually gonna drawyou the layouton the board so if you want to just go straight to the second slide, um , which basically shows , sort of I took the ideas that we were talking about last time um and tried to put that into the remote control so the things that y you can actually see on it are the on off switch , volume and channel control , the menu access button , ergonomic shape , which I completely agree with Christine's idea to have it sort of molded , so it's slightly more ergonomic and comfortable to hold than the r standard very straight remote controls . 
UNKNOWN And actually the other thing with the wood if we take your customising idea , is that people can actually do sort of quasi-measurements on their hand size , so if someone has larger hands , you have a wider remote control . 
UNKNOWN Right , my hand is uh different size than yours for example . 
UNKNOWN So , that's actually a really good idea for customi customisability . 
UNKNOWN Um , one thing I thought might be kind of interesting is to put a flip screen on it , just like you have on flip phones , so that you don't have this case where someone sits on the remote control or accidentally puts their hand on it , especially if you have little kids around , they're not pressing the buttons while you're trying to watch a T_V_ show and accidentally change the channel or turn it off . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN And also um you had issues with the batteries running out , so I thought maybe we could put a little battery life-light on it that kind of goes dimmer and dimmer and dimmer as your battery is starts to die . 
UNKNOWN And in terms of invisible features , audio and um tactile feedback on button presses and , like you said , speech recognition . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So , in terms of what this thing would actually look like Despite working in interface design , I'm not the greatest artist in the world , so you'll have to forgive me . 
UNKNOWN You'd have something like this with an on-off switch fairly big , sort of in the corner and by itself , so you don't accidentally turn your T_V_ off while you're trying to manoeuvre other buttons . 
UNKNOWN And then you have sort of one of those toggle displays for , oops , channels and volume , sort of for surfing channels and then volume , so the volume would be the up and down , 'cause volume goes up and down and then channels left to right . 
UNKNOWN And then here you'd have your sort of standard , telephonish number pad . 
UNKNOWN And then on one side you would have an access to the menu on your T_V_ and on the other side a way to turn off the voice control . 
UNKNOWN So that if the user doesn't want to use their voice , they can just turn it off and you don't have the remote control accidentally changing things on you . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um , so again you can have a little L_C_D_ light somewhere , the flip thing and Have I forgotten anything ? 
UNKNOWN I don't think so . 
UNKNOWN So , as you can see , it's a very very simple design , which is one of the things I really wanted to keep , is keep it simple , not have too many buttons , not have too many functionalities thrown into it . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN Think the design can pretty much carry over to everything , although with the wood the flip screen might have to do something slightly different . 
UNKNOWN A hinge . 
UNKNOWN Be like a copper hinge or you know . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But you also have to d start watching out for the weight , 'cause depending on how much the the flip screen will add to the weight of the remote control , you don't want it to start getting too heavy . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN But that's the general layoutwith the general functionalities , if we come up with something else . 
UNKNOWN As you can see , there's still lots of space on the actual remote control and if you do it customisably , you can make this thing fairly small or fairly o large , depending on personal preferences . 
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm , mm-hmm . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN So , that's pretty much all I had to say , I mean , everything else in terms of design issues . 
UNKNOWN Um the centering of the key pad and the channel is just depending on where your thumb is and you tend to use the the volume control and uh the browsing more than the actual number pad , so that would be sort of in direct line of where your thumb goes when you are holding the remote control , the number pad a little bit lower 'cause it's used less frequently . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So once we decide exactly what we want , then we can figure out the exact positioning , but more or less I think it should go along those lines . 
UNKNOWN So what's your , uh , the comments or uh s Okay Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Simple design . 
UNKNOWN It's what consumers want . 
UNKNOWN It's almost like , Houston , we have a product here . 
UNKNOWN Problem is obviously gonna be cost . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Okay , I also have a f very simple presentation, because for the marketing point you have to see what the consumers want . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I also have uh copied a different type of remote . 
UNKNOWN If you can find me , where I'm at . 
UNKNOWN There should only be one in here . 
UNKNOWN trend watch . 
CONFIRMATION Sure . 
UNKNOWN It's being modified . 
UNKNOWN They're stealing our product . 
UNKNOWN We've been giving simple questionnaires in different areas because th obviously we have to see what the com consumers are looking for today , 'cause uh trends change very very quickly . 
UNKNOWN In six months maybe this idea is already gone out the window , so it's gonna be a question how fast we can act . 
UNKNOWN Uh they already erased the rest of mine , huh . 
UNKNOWN No , f go to findings . 
UNKNOWN No , no . 
UNKNOWN No no , no no . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause I had another comment there . 
UNKNOWN Uh the market trend . 
UNKNOWN This is what we know from the last uh from the questionnaires from the the all the p surveys we've done , fancy and feel-good , that's what we've been looking for , something that feels good in the hand , that's easy to use . 
UNKNOWN Looking for next generation of innovation , because all the remotes out there now , they're all very similar , they all do the same thing , we have to have something completely different . 
UNKNOWN Okay ? 
UNKNOWN Easy to use , has always has become has become another major interest that uh , with the whiteboard we can see that it's a remote that's easy to use . 
UNKNOWN And I think this is another thing that's interesting is the consumers actually willing to pay the price for exciting tel technology . 
UNKNOWN So even if we have a product that may be more expensive , if it comes out right , if they look it looks and feels good and has technology . 
UNKNOWN The second two , you can see the last one is a very easy simple design . 
UNKNOWN The second one , there is about uh forty-five thousand different buttons on it , which makes it fairly hard to read , uh very hard to use . 
UNKNOWN The first one , I see that they put in a display . 
UNKNOWN Now there's something else uh with the little flip-up , now we're adding all kinds of things in , but with the little flip-up , if you have a little display on the flip-up that when you close it everything is locked . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Maybe the display also makes it easier to use , because sometimes when you're looking for buttons , maybe if you see a display Okay Because I've seen mostly the standard ones , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Context-sensitive instructions , depending on what the tel what mode the T_V_ or the D_V_D_ or something else is in . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Especially you might need something like that for training the speech recognition and yeah . 
UNKNOWN Now you have it now you have one with the very simple also . 
UNKNOWN The idea is simple , but with a display , so you can see what you're doing . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So maybe if we can incorporate the easiness of use , trendy , fancy , feels good , uh with a display , wood , designer wood , designer colours , we might've Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN You know , maybe what you could do is when somebody orders the device id you could send them like um a uh uh b some sort of a foam rubber um ball , and then they would squeeze it , and it would take the shape of their hand . 
UNKNOWN Oh yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , so it's really molded to to your specific But th for that you'd also have to do sort of an average across families and things like that if unless everyone has their own personal remote . 
UNKNOWN To t an and then you would know like um what the geometry of their hands would be and uh Yes you'd know what kind of wood to get . 
UNKNOWN How hard they squeeze ? 
UNKNOWN Resistance resistance , right . 
UNKNOWN That's right , that's right , you wouldn't wanna go too far down that . 
UNKNOWN Oh that that actually would uh increase the um the revenues we could expect , yeah . 
UNKNOWN The sales , yeah . 
UNKNOWN The Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I hope so . 
UNKNOWN No , but incorporating the three uh obviously it'd be something totally new on the market , totally different and from Although , what it was it uh it was uh Nokia that came out with this changeable colours . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well , already the customisability is a really good sort of new gimmick . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Right , you take it apart , and put on another face , take it off and put on another face and then they sold millions , millions . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Right , mm . 
UNKNOWN And that took off , yeah , yeah . 
UNKNOWN So . 
UNKNOWN So say with the f with the findings , with the research , easy to use something totally new . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN We have to come up with something totally new that is not on the market . 
UNKNOWN We'd also have to wor um consider that uh who we were gonna get to make these custom cases in terms of manufacturing processes , we might wanna um learn about um labour laws . 
UNKNOWN You know in different countries and stuff wher so we can do it cheap , but you don't wanna exploit uh labour in um third world countries . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So actually you could turn it y turn around and say that you're uh par the reason the cost is high for the device is because um you're paying a a working wage to the person who made the device . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but we can get a production in , uh , countries like , uh , India yes , yes , countries like India or China or Malaysia , so you can go a better features and better price and you can sell more . 
UNKNOWN Cost of living is low . 
UNKNOWN So Yeah , yeah , so Yes . 
UNKNOWN Good , well th that'd be something that manufacturing would have to um explore more and to where Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Mm yeah . 
UNKNOWN Where w Where it would be manufactured is is another step . 
UNKNOWN So Yeah , so Yes uh , but uh that that we can that we can talk about the production later , okay , depends on the the quantity , okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN We're here to design , come up with a nice product . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So we don't need to have our own uh fabric factory or something , so we can have a tie-up with who the do the fabric , okay , for the different uh electronics items , then we can have a business tie-up and to get to cut the cost , okay , to sell more . 
UNKNOWN So , but uh le let's decide first about the components concept and uh interface concept , okay , if is acceptable for both of you , what uh Ed was talking . 
UNKNOWN And your design whether you want with the display or without display or just a simple , so Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN I think it depends , I mean I think it's a good idea , but we need to really think about how useful it's gonna be because theoretically with the T_V_ you already have a big display right in front of you . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN So , if we're trying to keep costs down , then maybe sacrificing the display is a way to go . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN I mean it depends on how much putting a display costs and what it would be used for very specifically what it would be used for , 'cause if it's only used for one little thing , then putting in a big display case or a big display that's probably expensive just to do the training on the chip for the speech recognition or whatever , may not be the most cost-efficient way to go , but that's just sort of speculation , I mean . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN What do you think Ed ? 
UNKNOWN Do you he liked the display in one of the concepts that you showed , um , do you know how much it costs , um , to to add a little display like this uh ? 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN No no p spec It's 'cause we have to find out cost on it . 
UNKNOWN Do you wanna take an action item to go find out ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Sorry about that . 
UNKNOWN Um , no that's no problem . 
UNKNOWN I'm here for the pushing it after it's made . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN I will market it . 
UNKNOWN Once we get a price on it then we can market it . 
UNKNOWN So the the advanced chip on printis what um what we've we've deci we've determined and the uh engineering industrial design is the recommendation , and um I think we've kinda come to some agreement regarding um this concept of a wooden case . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN A customisable and Uh I don't think so , no , I think they could be rubber like they are now , so you have that tactile experience of So um are we done with this meeting ? 
UNKNOWN Nice beautiful mahogany red wooden case . 
UNKNOWN What about the buttons , would Would the buttons be wood too , or Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN I don't think so . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN Don't looks nice uh . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , so uh what we'll do is , uh , we will stick with the the simple design for time being until uh th Ed find outs about the how much it's cost to the extra , in case we go for the display . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So maybe what you can do is uh , both of you , you can come up with the the prototype , okay , the model . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Okay ? 
CONFIRMATION Sure . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I hope , if is it okay if uh they will come up with the prototype design , okay . 
UNKNOWN Then they can show you how it looks like , and then we can uh submit to the I will submit to the management . 
UNKNOWN Okay ? 
UNKNOWN Then meantime you can come up with the price , how much it's cost as extra for uh the display . 
UNKNOWN And a marketing strategy . 
UNKNOWN An and the marketing strategy , that's very important , okay . 
UNKNOWN And marketing strategy , thank you . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN How much you can how mu how much how much you can sell extra . 
UNKNOWN Fired . 
UNKNOWN Of course you'll make money too , so it it's not only pay-out , you make money too , your commission . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so , any questions ? 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN So , by next meeting , so , please come up with the the prototype , okay , then uh , then we can proceed from there . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN It's okay ? 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So thanks for all your uh efforts and coming for the meeting again , and see you soon then . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Okay ? 
THANKS Thank you . 
UNKNOWN I'm sorry to be late . 
UNKNOWN Welcome back . 
UNKNOWN Welcome back everybody . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Thanks . 
UNKNOWN So this meeting agendawill be the detailed design meeting . 
UNKNOWN And uh opening and uh P_M_s of the meet minutes, uh prototype presentationfrom uh Christine and uh Agnes . 
UNKNOWN Agnes , yes . 
UNKNOWN Yes and uh evaluation criteria . 
UNKNOWN The finance , it's uh from my side , from the management , and uh production evaluation . 
UNKNOWN Then uh closing . 
UNKNOWN So we have forty minutes to discuss and uh finalise and close the product and project and to move further , okay , so Okay , let's talk about uh maybe first uh for the prototype . 
UNKNOWN Mm , okay . 
UNKNOWN So I handle to So shall I go to sorry . 
UNKNOWN I've done a presentation, but it pretty much covers work that we've both done , so if I'm missing anything , Christine can just correct me . 
UNKNOWN Uh thank you , so you did a PowerPoint presentation, good for you . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN S Okay , let's go to A_M_I_ . 
UNKNOWN It's not the biggest PowerPoint presentationin the world , but Three . 
UNKNOWN So in two or three or Yeah . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN No it's think it's the last one . 
UNKNOWN Probably . 
UNKNOWN Technical pa I would think . 
UNKNOWN No , then this is the la yeah , that one , final design . 
UNKNOWN Ha . 
UNKNOWN It is named appropriately , you just couldn't see the name . 
UNKNOWN Um okay , can I have the mouse ? 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
CONFIRMATION Thanks . 
UNKNOWN Alright , so from when we were discussing specifying the case in the last meeting , we decided that we wanted an ergonomic shape , the material that we chose was wood , and uh the colour would be customisable , 'cause you can stain the wood whatever colour . 
UNKNOWN Um , so in terms of function , you have to be able to turn the T_V_ on and off , volume and channel control , menu control , voice recognition control , and we've incorporated the L_C_D_ screen on the flip panel as part of the design , if we figure out it's too expensive , well then you just take it off . 
UNKNOWN Um , so to unveil our lovely product . 
UNKNOWN This is our remote control , with the flip panel as you can see . 
UNKNOWN So if you lift up the panel , you can see the lovely yellow L_C_D_ display . 
UNKNOWN Um , this is actually hard to do . 
UNKNOWN The yellow button you have is the on off button , so it's really big , hard to miss . 
UNKNOWN You have the the red um triangles are the toggles for changing the volume . 
UNKNOWN So up volume up , down volume down . 
UNKNOWN The green are the channel changing . 
UNKNOWN S And it's one of those very light , very touchable displays . 
UNKNOWN And then you have the numeric pad in the dark blue at the bottom , and on the right-hand side you have the access to the menu on the T_V_ , and on the left-hand side you have the the the ability to turn off the voice recognition . 
UNKNOWN So this is pretty much what we had on the white board the last time . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So . 
UNKNOWN Um and uh I could Yeah the d We haven't um uh specified where the speaker or the microphone will be placed . 
UNKNOWN Oh yes . 
UNKNOWN Additional feature on the back is that you can have your own customised backing and I suppose you could do the same thing on the flip case on the front . 
UNKNOWN So that you can really make this a highly highly customisable remote control . 
UNKNOWN That depends on the uh s design of the circuit board inside and uh what room is left um Yes , okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think the microphone is on on the top , uh on the middle , the under the flip . 
UNKNOWN Uh-huh . 
UNKNOWN So that will be the safe , so p any the chip it's not on the chip because you need to have microphone to Yes . 
UNKNOWN No , I mean it depends on the design of the circuit board . 
UNKNOWN But it shouldn't be under the flip either , because you can have the remote control closed , but you still might want to activate it by voice . 
UNKNOWN Uh it's it's Yeah , but uh uh my opinion I think it's better under the flip because whenever you want to uh the talk , okay , so then you can speak then you can close it . 
UNKNOWN But if you put it on the on the flip , okay , then uh technical I don't think it's uh feasible , 'cause most of the time you speak then it will be recognised . 
UNKNOWN But if you've already got the remote control in your hand you need to open the flip to use the voice , why use the voice , why not just use your hand ? 
UNKNOWN I mean the whole point of the voice is that if the remote control is sitting there and I'm too lazy to reach over and pick it up , I can just use my voice . 
UNKNOWN Maybe I've got my hand in the popcorn bowl and I'm holding my cup of Coca-Cola in the other hand . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And you don't wanna let go of either one . 
UNKNOWN I don't wanna say . 
UNKNOWN Louder . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I mean it doesn't have to be on the flip , it can be on the side somewhere . 
UNKNOWN Can also be on the side . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , the sides maybe is good . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So That's good idea . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So , I mean I can pass this around if anyone wants to Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN So it's maybe good idea . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , y better you pass it around with a napkin . 
UNKNOWN No , because y you can easily put a microphone on the side that would have no problem would haven't been not be damaged or anything , and it'd be accessible all the time to voice . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , exactly . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So it's maybe good idea . 
UNKNOWN S s Okay . 
UNKNOWN It's um It's um You need to work on the weight a little bit . 
UNKNOWN Compliments to the artist . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
CONFUSION Uh . 
UNKNOWN S I'm fine , I'm satisfi I'm satisfied . 
UNKNOWN And maybe the shape of the buttons , the little egg shapes aren't the most economical , but Yeah . 
UNKNOWN We're glad you're satisfied . 
UNKNOWN Of course it's it's it's looks more heo heavy , but I think when it's completely maybe it's a less weight . 
UNKNOWN I mean this is plasticene . 
UNKNOWN There's only so much you can do . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN We could have possibly made it a lot thinner as well . 
UNKNOWN But And part of the thing is m a lot of people say that they don't like something that's too light , because they don't feel like they have enough control over it . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So I mean maybe this is excessively heavy , but I think it needs to have some weight , it needs to feel like you're still holding something . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN So that's pretty much it for our presentationactually . 
UNKNOWN That's your uh prototype model ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay , that's good , thank you very much . 
UNKNOWN So any comments or uh Okay . 
UNKNOWN Well , the prototype is is very well within the design and ideas that we've we've talked about on the previous meetings . 
UNKNOWN Now it goes into this next phase as the financial uh marketing uh Well we haven't come to mine yet , so we're gonna have a bit of difference of opinion , yes . 
UNKNOWN Yes , that uh So I'll come back to the So evaluation criteria , I think uh that will be good , so then let's come to the finance uh , I have some uh calculations which I made uh as for uh the budget . 
UNKNOWN So here you can uh look like uh the energy and uh dynamo and uh kinetic and solar cells . 
UNKNOWN Uh it's optional , somewhat optional and Ed wants the chip on print, that's what uh we were talking about that . 
UNKNOWN So then we have sample sensor and sample speaker , then uh we have the wood material , then special colour and push button . 
UNKNOWN So it's uh actually , our budget was uh twelve point five Euro , but uh it's coming to nine point nine five Euro , so we are under uh below the budget , okay , so still we are saving some money . 
UNKNOWN I think it's a good figure . 
UNKNOWN Yes , great I I'm surprised . 
UNKNOWN Congratulations . 
UNKNOWN Than thank you . 
CONFIRMATION Oh , okay . 
UNKNOWN It's gonna cost a long way to c you know , cost a lot of money to market it , is it ? 
UNKNOWN So maybe it's for some money we can utilise for our uh marketing , for the sales , okay , and uh It's not . 
UNKNOWN Well , it just depends on if we're gonna add a o on this pr provisionary cost analysis , we do not have a L_C_ display . 
UNKNOWN L_C_ display is gonna be very expensive , it's gonna be It's not it doesn't say . 
UNKNOWN No we do , but it's not filled in . 
UNKNOWN It's number thirty . 
UNKNOWN Thirty . 
UNKNOWN We don't have the price up there , okay , so if we add approximately two to three Euro per remote , now we're up around about twelve , twelve and a half as to what uh the company had initially uh requested . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Oh , yeah , yeah , you're right , sorry , yes . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So that means we can put the uh the L_C_D_ in , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um Display in . 
UNKNOWN But as far as production um I'm putting up a question because we're talking about profit also , and in mine you'll see uh the problem with uh our survey , the p the possibility that how many units can be sold , what percentage of the market , etcetera etcetera because that has to be taken in into consideration . 
UNKNOWN Uh this is just production cost , it is not uh advertising cost , it's not transportation cost uh And that will inflate quite a bit the cost of the uh the cost of the unit for the company . 
UNKNOWN Yes , so still uh we have twelve point five Euro . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but Yes . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN Um-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So to come up with what the company wants is a fifty million Pound profit , we're gonna have to go a long ways . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN This we are talking about one unit , okay , so when it go into the quantity , okay , and the cost will come down . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN Slightly . 
UNKNOWN Although customisation , because this is being done , you know , the on on-order basis , it might be uh the the quantity won't m won't uh the circuit board will b you're right , would be in producing quantity , but the cost of the case would uh be fixed at the Uh you got some pretty cheap labour that can do this case for one Euro . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It's gonna be very hard to reduce . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN That's not bad . 
UNKNOWN That's really that's the cost of the material and lab wow , that's really outstanding . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But anyhow , still we are under control , okay , so what uh I will do is I will try to negotiate with the vendors , okay , to get uh the production cost less , okay , so then we can save some money , okay , to put into th our marketing or uh you know the promotions , whatever , okay , so that uh I will look after . 
UNKNOWN I will speak to the management and how to get uh you know some more uh cost down . 
UNKNOWN If we can go to to my display . 
UNKNOWN And we'll come back to yours just to give everybody an idea of the market . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN So now I'm gonna scare everybody out of this project . 
UNKNOWN If I'm still here . 
UNKNOWN You're in four ? 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN The four gives me it's gotta be uh TrendWatch . 
UNKNOWN TrendWatch . 
UNKNOWN Is this the same one you did before ? 
NEGATION No . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN It shouldn't be if it's not it's not the right one . 
UNKNOWN That's no , I think it's the same one . 
UNKNOWN No , no we g no , that's the same one . 
UNKNOWN You have to go back and find another one . 
UNKNOWN Whatever name it popped up under . 
UNKNOWN Uh functional , try functional , it might not be it either , but we'll see . 
UNKNOWN Functional . 
UNKNOWN It looks like it , there's S Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yep , that's it . 
UNKNOWN So we'll go screen by screen . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Although since uh we need to have some type of idea on a market uh we had independent study that says it this this market has an availability to absorb eight mi eight million units per year . 
UNKNOWN Okay ? 
UNKNOWN Our internal company evaluation puts it between eight to nine million which is approximately the same as the independent study . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN So if we continue , we'll look at the findings . 
UNKNOWN Next screen . 
UNKNOWN Which means that uh if we have a target of two million would the company has to take twenty five percent of the market in the first year , which is actually a tremendous amount . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , no kidding . 
UNKNOWN No kidding , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Mayb maybe they already expected something . 
UNKNOWN So , if we put an inflated price of fifty Euro at a production cost that cannot exceed twenty-five Euro , okay , we're already in that that price , okay , with transport , promotion , labour , because we hav gi included the promotion in the cost , transport for the material to the stores or whatever how however we're gonna break this down between our our retailers . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN Um-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Twenty-five percent of the market to get to two million units . 
UNKNOWN At two million units , we have to have a profit of twenty-five Euro per unit to get to the fifty million unit Eu Euro profit . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN Okay ? 
UNKNOWN So , obviously we w w I just did a run down the evaluation of the form , the fan uh the fancy stylishness of the of the unit , the ease of use , speech recognition , cost , we've gone through these . 
UNKNOWN Now , the company must evaluate the feasibility of being able to take enough of the market to justify in production . 
UNKNOWN Or we project this over two years , but being that the market changes very very quickly , maybe there's no more interest in buying this thing in eighteen months from now . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN So , now we have to come up with a decision . 
UNKNOWN Of course . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Can the company sell two million units ? 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN Can it sell it for fifty Euros ? 
UNKNOWN Could could I go to findings ? 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN Uh uh um I would uh like to explore the possibility of using um alternative um delivery and sales channel which would be um to use the internet for promotion and ordering and then to drop-ship the p product to the customer's residence . 
UNKNOWN I was thinking the same thing , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN Directly . 
UNKNOWN That way you have no storage , you have no um you do have transportation , still have the labour cost , but you don't have the transport to the uh point of sale . 
UNKNOWN Um-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN The point of sale is online . 
UNKNOWN To the agents . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN You can do a shipping centre somewhere , or strategically place shipping centres to minimise distance costs . 
UNKNOWN Right , like Amazon . 
UNKNOWN In fact , we should sell through Amazon , don't you think ? 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN Or eBay , or Yes . 
UNKNOWN Or eBay , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN There's an idea . 
UNKNOWN Going with um Ah , we we're do you know , selling a unique product uh . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's a good idea . 
UNKNOWN To impro more profit and uh Yeah , yes . 
UNKNOWN S Upscale technology . 
UNKNOWN Well . 
UNKNOWN That actually makes more sense if we're gonna make it so highly customisable , 'cause on the web people can look at the different options they have , see maybe what other people have done , what the range of possibility as , whereas if you're in a store , you can't unless you're a highly imaginative person , you may not really know what it is you want , whereas on the web , if you have a bunch of pictures , it can sort of trigger ideas and Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN There are several companies that have gone that way . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN And you can even have an a movie that you can rotate the object and look at the di the only thing that you're missing really is the weight . 
UNKNOWN The weight and feel . 
UNKNOWN Weight , the feel of the product , but There are several that have gone through with the watches , too . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN We're getting used to that . 
UNKNOWN It's not quite like trying on a shoe , but people are getting used to buying things online that they can't touch before buying . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN You can customise a watch , you can see how it is at the f at the end of the production , you can change it uh There's a lot of online that's that is doing this now . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Uh-huh . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN And when you're rotating , you'll look behind and look this way uh it's possible to do with this , maybe there's a possibility of selling more than two million units in one year , which could you know , feasibili feasibility uh lower the price of the unit . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN We can . 
CONFIRMATION Great . 
UNKNOWN I don't think that's uh not possible , it's uh okay then , l uh let's wait for the production , okay , then uh you can evaluate the product , so how it looks like technically and uh how it look like uh the real . 
UNKNOWN What turnaround time do we have ? 
UNKNOWN T Oh but Yes it's it's very quick , of course . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause I mean production evaluation can be very very quick or very very long . 
UNKNOWN It will uh come back in two weeks , okay , it will be ready in two weeks . 
UNKNOWN Works for me . 
UNKNOWN For evaluation , okay . 
UNKNOWN Prototypes , you mean . 
UNKNOWN Yes , the prototype uh prototype product evaluation . 
UNKNOWN In um We probably should do some market tests uh once we have the prototypes and do some orders and things like that and test-market it . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN Well , obviously . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN Mm that'd have to be thrown out on the market for people to get an idea , to see get get their I think we pretty much covered everything . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So you can take a minimum two weeks to a maximum four weeks . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Think minimum two weeks if we're gonna develop prototypes and then try to take them to different places and see how people use it's not a trivial task . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , because we we are not going to do it in uh our factory , okay , so we can give it a product evalua Yes , yes . 
UNKNOWN No no . 
UNKNOWN We definitely shouldn't do it in our factory . 
UNKNOWN So we'll do it in the other place , and I don't think it's take more than four weeks time . 
UNKNOWN Or uh Okay , so then the real production we will start once we product evaluation , okay , then uh it's approve from uh the technical team and uh your team , okay , uh from the management , then we can launch in the market . 
UNKNOWN Hm ? 
UNKNOWN Any outstanding ? 
UNKNOWN S Any any other uh questions or uh comments to be discuss ? 
UNKNOWN No , I'm go ahead . 
UNKNOWN What ab Well I was just wondering about if we're gonna do a product evaluation then what about time for redesign if the users come back and tell us no this is bad , this is bad , we want this done differently . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so then uh Okay uh , let's take like this . 
UNKNOWN Did you have something ? 
UNKNOWN Let's proceed with this model , okay , for the for the marketing direction , okay . 
UNKNOWN So no more changes will be made , okay , in this the basic design . 
UNKNOWN Okay ? 
UNKNOWN So we will introduce m this model and uh let's introduce in the market and let's take the feedback from the customers , then we can uh go for the second generation . 
UNKNOWN Second generation . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN There's no end , there's not limit . 
UNKNOWN The problem is there might not be a second generation if the first generation flops for some silly reason that we haven't thought of . 
UNKNOWN Every every custom Okay . 
UNKNOWN Well , then it may not be . 
UNKNOWN Well , every customer , okay , they have their own ideas , they have their own test , okay , so there's no end , there's no limit . 
UNKNOWN Like people don't like wood . 
UNKNOWN No , but there's a difference between releasing a product that has been minimally tested and fine-tuned to suit a general range of requirements versus releasing a product that we think will work but we don't really have anything to back it up . 
UNKNOWN very specific . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , so that's the reason you are here for uh the design , okay , I hope you made a good design . 
UNKNOWN Yes , but I'm not everybody . 
UNKNOWN I mean the whole point of user evaluation is to see what real people need . 
UNKNOWN We have our own motivations in mind , we have our own ideas in mind , but that doesn't mean that that's what's gonna sell . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but uh see , we ought to take a few considerations , okay , one is the price consideration , one is future consideration , okay , like uh you can eat uh you can all eat more chi I can eat more chilli , okay , so i it's a depends on the individual taste , you know , so we have we have to balance somewhere . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , of course . 
UNKNOWN I'm just trying to point out that I think that your evaluation and redesign turnaround time is too short well you have no redesign not you personally , but in the project we have no redesign time and Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN Our project doesn't um Ed , d do you know what season of the year or time of the year is the most important for T_V_ remote control sales ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Would it be the Christmas season by any chance ? 
UNKNOWN The sports time . 
UNKNOWN Sports season . 
UNKNOWN Right before the Eur the World Cup . 
UNKNOWN Which sport season ? 
UNKNOWN Football . 
UNKNOWN World soccer . 
UNKNOWN So so maybe what So I think what we need to do is perhaps to synchronise the final the the launch of a user-tested device with some special event . 
UNKNOWN World Cup soccer , they need those things that they have their hands g occupied and they need to be able to talk to the con remote control . 
UNKNOWN Football . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's a good idea . 
UNKNOWN And and then um so that gives us a little more time perhaps then we anticipated , because I don't know when the World Cup is , but I'm sure there's gonna be one . 
UNKNOWN Or any major sports . 
UNKNOWN Or another m major sports event . 
UNKNOWN Probably not the um the football games coming up the end of January . 
UNKNOWN I think that might be a little too aggressive um , but , so , I'm just ig uh pointing out a uh a strategy to uh do some additional user testing pri and then to launch um at a a major sports event or uh perhaps to uh also And to work with motion pictures . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Research . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN That's actually good place to advertise it too . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN There might be some motion pictures that are coming out um that are coming out on D_V_D_ that uh they need to have a m special remote control to work with it , so we could maybe work out a campaign with uh with Sony Pictures for example . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN Maybe some management has got uh relationships there we can leverage . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Yes , the that of course uh I will convince the management to do that , okay . 
UNKNOWN That's great . 
UNKNOWN It's just something to to keep in mind , 'cause it's really really important . 
UNKNOWN Sure , sure , yes . 
UNKNOWN A lot of products have gone out there without being properly user-tested and completely flopped , when in fact it gets re-released a few years down the line with proper testing and it takes off like crazy . 
UNKNOWN Disposable diapers is an example of that in fact . 
UNKNOWN Really ? 
UNKNOWN Yes , it is one of the first consumer products that was launched about thirty years that was a disposable consumer product , and uh people the market hadn't really gotten on to the concept that you could use something and then throw it away , 'cause it wasn't uh but then when they re-launched them thirty years later , they were virtually the same design , but people had gotten the throw-away , you know , papercups and napki y all kinds of things that they hadn't um so , you're right , timing is very important , but I think we've got a good product . 
UNKNOWN That I didn't know . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN That's the reason Ed is here . 
UNKNOWN I think he can promote the the brand value and the product value . 
UNKNOWN That's right . 
UNKNOWN It's gonna be very important to the company . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN We are behind the scene and he is the front screen , so . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I'm the one who takes the heat . 
UNKNOWN He's on the big screen . 
UNKNOWN Exactly . 
UNKNOWN Good luck , Ed . 
UNKNOWN If it's a flop , it's the marketer . 
UNKNOWN You look very relaxed , considering h you know , the uh the weight on your shoulders , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN Stress . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so then uh let's come to the closing and uh are the costs within the budget and uh is the product evaluated , okay , so that will uh come soon . 
UNKNOWN Celebration . 
UNKNOWN Okay for uh but our time being , so thanks for all your efforts and great work and uh great design and uh let's leave it to the Ed for later for once production is over and the meantime let's celebrate . 
UNKNOWN So let's meet up uh this evening to hang up for some party . 
UNKNOWN Sounds good . 
UNKNOWN 'S good . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
THANKS Thank you . 
CONFIRMATION Very good . 
UNKNOWN Nice working with you . 
THANKS Thank you very much . 
THANKS Thank you . 
CONFIRMATION Thanks . 
THANKS Thank you again for all . 
UNKNOWN And see you in the evening for drinks . 
UNKNOWN Bye-bye . 
UNKNOWN Yep , okay , see you later on . 
FAREWELL Bye . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Everybody ready ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think so . 
UNKNOWN Uh I think the first thing we do is introduce ourselves and everybody's name and what your function is ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's a good plan . 
UNKNOWN So maybe we start with you ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , my name is Francina . 
UNKNOWN And I'm uh an user interface my role is uh the main responsibility is user interface . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN And my role is to design uh a television remote control . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN And I'm a marketing person . 
UNKNOWN I wanna figure out how to sell them . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN And your name is ? 
UNKNOWN My name is Eileen . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh I'm Jeanne-Oui . 
UNKNOWN Um uh my role is industrial designer and my responsibilities are uh uh um deal with the technical-functional designsand specifications of user interface and dealing with user interface design . 
CONFIRMATION Very good . 
UNKNOWN And as you already know I am Betty . 
UNKNOWN I am the project manager for today . 
UNKNOWN So why don't we look at the presentationto see what we really are supposed to do . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Yes y opening , acquaintance , tool training well , the tools are , I think , we already I guess the tool is really our the computer , as far as I can see . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Uh we get ins each of us will get instructions and we'll take it from there . 
UNKNOWN Project plan , that falls under the same heading pretty much . 
UNKNOWN Um , I don't think we have any great discussion at this point . 
NEGATION No . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Here is what this thing should be . 
UNKNOWN This thing we are gonna um uh design is a new remote control . 
UNKNOWN Uh should be original , trendy , and , of course , user friendly . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So maybe you wanna make some notesof that . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Okay ? 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN All right . 
UNKNOWN Here is what the functional design is supposed to achieve . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN That is it's gonna be individual work and then at the meeting we'll discuss what uh we have come up with . 
UNKNOWN The same goes for the conceptual design , there will be individual work whic and then discussion afterwards . 
UNKNOWN Detailed design , same thing basically . 
UNKNOWN Mm 'kay so Three different types of design that we're gonna be concerned with okay . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Functional , conception and detailed . 
UNKNOWN I can't write with this thing . 
UNKNOWN Maybe we should redesign it . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN After we've finished the remote control we'll get to that . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , okay . 
UNKNOWN All right ? 
UNKNOWN Then , tool training try out the white board , participant can drawtheir favourite animal . 
UNKNOWN Does anybody want to go and see how the white board works ? 
UNKNOWN So that in case we have to , in the next meeting , present something on the white board . 
UNKNOWN You wanna go Eileen and Whether you without hanging yourself . 
UNKNOWN Okay , I'll see what I can do . 
UNKNOWN See if I r See if I remember how to drawa kitty cat or a rabbit or something . 
UNKNOWN And remember you have to press so it works . 
UNKNOWN So that it will record okay . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um uh um traditional kitty cat . 
UNKNOWN Fat , a fat cat . 
UNKNOWN I've a very fat cat . 
UNKNOWN And it likes to sit like that . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN And you're Francine , right ? 
UNKNOWN Yes , I'm Francina . 
UNKNOWN Would you like s like just to see um how it feels , so that you have a little idea ? 
UNKNOWN Yes , sure . 
UNKNOWN Am I supposed to wipe off that or okay . 
UNKNOWN In No , no . 
UNKNOWN No , that's okay . 
UNKNOWN No , Okay . 
UNKNOWN I don't know , we'll get to that later . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN What should I draw? 
UNKNOWN Snake . 
UNKNOWN I'm going to drawa snake . 
UNKNOWN How does it look like ? 
UNKNOWN Uh , okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN I hope the kitty cat is hungry 'cause I don't like snakes . 
UNKNOWN Here's the project finance uh which , of course , we all have to think about when we design this thing . 
UNKNOWN Um selling price is supposed to be twenty five Euro . 
UNKNOWN Uh profit aim for the company is fifty million Euro , the market range unlimited meaning international and the production cost should not exceed hopefully should be less than twelve fifty Euro . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Mm 'kay that should keep everybody on their toes and challenged . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Profit . 
UNKNOWN Um is fifty mm . 
UNKNOWN So these are all things , of course , to remember with the budget and when you design to materials , cost , etcetera . 
UNKNOWN Now , uh the discussion I guess is um does anyone of you have experience with remote control ? 
UNKNOWN Oops . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , of course , using remote control . 
UNKNOWN I exp I s 'cause we we use 'em we use 'em , right , everyday . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And um now having used a remote control for years does anybody already have like an idea like things you didn't like with it , things you would like to change , things you would like to improve with this thing ye any first ideas ? 
UNKNOWN Would you like it to be smaller , bigger , have more have more buttons on it or maybe clearly better marked buttons , you know , things like that ? 
CONFUSION Uh . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I Yes , I I feel that all the remote should be very compact . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Small , right . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , those which we get here nowadays it's very long . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN And um and it should have multi-purpose . 
UNKNOWN Like uh the remote control which we use for T_V_ , it shou uh it should be used f uh for some other purpose also , like controlling the uh temperature inside the house or for air-conditioners , or for heating system . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Audio player . 
SURPRISE Oh .
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So it should be a multi-functional uh gadget that would um control all your household uh uh machines basically . 
UNKNOWN Yes , exactly Yes . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN Divides us Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Exactly . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN At um twelve fifty Euros per Well who knows if we get a really good designer maybe we can do that . 
UNKNOWN Well . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN We certainly can try to I agree with her that to market something successfully it should do some more things . 
UNKNOWN It should be something new it should be s it it should do something different than than just what we have . 
UNKNOWN That's right . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , of course . 
UNKNOWN Now , of course , the other thing to think there is maybe the design . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , design should be , yeah it should be different . 
UNKNOWN All the almost all the remotes Yes , exactly . 
UNKNOWN Like trendy no like f for earlier we saw maybe it should be something trendy you know . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , maybe ten I do yeah , colours and al shapes also . 
UNKNOWN Maybe it should different colours or materials or you know . 
UNKNOWN Are different shapes . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um so yeah shapes right , you know , like kidney shape feels better in your hand or something , you know . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN Yeah of course yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah okay , friendly shape , that would help . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think another thing that would help is um if it beeps when you clap , because I think one of the big things that happens is people lose them . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN They can't find it . 
UNKNOWN That is true , because they put a newspaper or they put it behind a plant or , we you know , whatever . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN And and they suddenly the phone rings and they want to turn the T_V_ off and they say , where the hell is my my remote control yeah ? 
UNKNOWN So some Uh so , so it's really the beep or , or a light should blink . 
UNKNOWN Well or yeah or if it's really , if it's really in a dark spot that it gives out a a sound or a signal . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , some beep or something like that , so that we can go Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Or a b Should ha A fluorescent signal , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So if lost If lost uh signal with b throw signal , you know . 
UNKNOWN Mm 'kay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , maybe it should have a light so that we can , we can just recognise where it is . 
UNKNOWN Exactly , I mean just that's what I'm saying . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah . 
UNKNOWN May not be beep . 
UNKNOWN I'm just saying throw signal meaning just whether it's a beep or whether a light or Okay , my my idea is maybe that the minuteit's really hidden , in in other words if it's like in a dark spot , uh meaning you know like a newspaper is on top , a sweater is on top or it it's behind a plant , at that moment it's it's like , it's like um , what you call it a light s sensors , you know ? 
UNKNOWN Beep or uh it's a light , maybe it's a light . 
UNKNOWN And do you think a good c c um clue for that is that it would respond to a clap or it would respond to your voice or it would respond what what should you have to do to make it beep or blink ? 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Okay so Okay . 
UNKNOWN In in that moment it has a sensor , i it it gets a certain darkness , it ge has a sensor and it gives out a signal whether that be a light signal or a beep , I mean , that we can discuss that later , you know . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , probably yeah , probably it's a yeah , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And uh Yes . 
UNKNOWN So the light sensor would activate the signal . 
UNKNOWN That's right . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN You know there would be right you have to have some kind of sensor and I I think uh voice or clapping it's not specific enough . 
UNKNOWN Uh I know there are the lamps and stuff , you know , you can clap on and off , but I think they only work to certain degree and What with Oh yeah well , but then those people we can't help everybody . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN But it could be someplace really obvious and you still wouldn't be able to find it . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , of course , that didn't I i we can't do it . 
UNKNOWN Well , because you're s because you're silly . 
UNKNOWN Then , in that case Yes . 
UNKNOWN Because people are silly . 
UNKNOWN I mean it could be on well , i if it were like on top of your bookcase and you usually kept it on the coffee table um , you know , well maybe we have to move along , okay . 
UNKNOWN Okay we have uh yeah , we have to move along , but I think we have some good good points to start with here . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , good point . 
UNKNOWN Okay , the next meeting will be in thirty minutes . 
UNKNOWN I think you all did you get uh notices on your computer for this ? 
UNKNOWN Me yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay so well , you got the notice um uh . 
UNKNOWN The working design , I guess that's the function I_D_ uh who is this ? 
UNKNOWN The industrial designer That's you . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , it's functional de yeah , exactly , technical . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So , we looking for a working design when we come back . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh working design , yeah , it's it's uh mainly technical-functional design . 
UNKNOWN Then And then the technical funct you are the technical function , so so you are the working design . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , functional design , and you Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So you have a working design and then a functional design . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN And the marketing manager is coming up with some user requirement specification , like friendliness , and what we just discussed in general . 
UNKNOWN That would be your idea . 
UNKNOWN And , of course , price . 
UNKNOWN That it , that it , that the price is a good price . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN I mean , the price is given , but , that was That's right . 
UNKNOWN We have to justify that price by having sufficient features to make it sell at that price . 
UNKNOWN That's right . 
UNKNOWN And , you know , specifi you you will get specific um instructions for that . 
UNKNOWN I think that's the end of the show . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So um we have well , we have a twen two two two three minutes . 
UNKNOWN Um any questions at this point ? 
UNKNOWN Or uh suggestions ? 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN I think basically basically you will get instructions to work with and if you have any questions uh , uh I guess , you can uh Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Okay , I think I have enough to think about 'til our next meeting . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , even I have . 
UNKNOWN How about you people ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , even I have , I think , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN Really ? 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Alright , well uh Okay , very good . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , so let's see . 
UNKNOWN Then uh we see you in about thirty minutes . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN And see what we can come up with . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Okay ? 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay , is everybody ready ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah I'd to just put on my microphone here and I'll be right with you . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Okay ? 
UNKNOWN Um I take it you all have received instructions as to what you were supposed to do and um I think the Marketing Manager probably should go first , addressing the needs and desires . 
UNKNOWN Mm ? 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN Okay you want me to start right now ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Well , could you um put my slidesup 'cause I think it might be helpful if uh we looked at the slidesat the same time . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN You're participant four . 
UNKNOWN I'm participant four I believe . 
UNKNOWN Yes uh-huh . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN Okay , and now I can uh full screen . 
UNKNOWN Open . 
UNKNOWN Uh , okay , okay . 
UNKNOWN There we go . 
UNKNOWN Okay well I think we have introduced ourselves , so the functional requirements are is is part of my goal but why don't we pass right to the second slide. 
UNKNOWN And then full screen . 
UNKNOWN Cause that's where m my discussion starts . 
UNKNOWN Right well um since I'm in charge of trying to figure out what we should put on this thing since I have to try to sell it . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um I thought that the method I should follow would be gather suggestions from everybody , and th the reason I just put that there like that is that uh in the init in the initial stage I think I should just be open to lots of suggestions . 
UNKNOWN You know you can say anything you want no matter how silly it sounds you know it should run your car , it should heat up your motor if should um turn on your C_D_ whatever you want it to do um and then as we go on what we'll have to do is accept and eliminate these suggestions according to um design and budget feasibility . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN So I'll be coming to you um frequently as the Industrial Expert to tell me how hard it's gonna be to add a feature or how expensive it's gonna be or if your time , if it takes five years to develop this it's just something we can't do . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Hmm hmm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN So in the beginning just have a big puddle of things that we anybody can th throw anything in and then just weed things out that can't be done for one reason or another , and then the things that seem the most attractive that to uh to a customer we'll try to then prioritise those . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So that was um what I meant there , and as I said on the slidethere consulting the Industrial Engineer about that and the other thing is timing is really gonna be as important as money , because if we're gonna sell this thing , I think the best time to sell it is as a Christmas present . 
UNKNOWN Twenty five Euros makes a nice little present , and we want it to be an impulse purchase , we want somebody to see it and think it's , gee I just gotta have that . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN And take out their wallet and buy it . 
UNKNOWN So it's gotta be really attractive and it but it's gotta go to market by September , 'cause anything that you don't already have out there in September showing it around , isn't gonna sell for Christmas . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um and then I'll be coming to you as the User Interface person to try to tell me from your point of view what are the most friendly features that we could put on it and try to prior help me with that prioritising of uh of the features and of the the look and the colour and I'll be coming back to you to help weed out those suggestions from that point of view . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So I'll be coming to you for how much is it gonna cost us and how long is it gonna take you , and I'll be coming to you to tell me what's gonna make somebody take out their wallet you know , what what's what's gonna really be what they call a sizzle , 'cause we gotta sell this sizzle . 
UNKNOWN Mm mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN What features . 
UNKNOWN S sellable . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN A lot of times the thing that works the best from an engineering point of view isn't the thing that somebody's really just gonna take out their wallet and buy for Christmas for for their child or for their husband or whatever . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN Okay can we go to the next slideplease ? 
UNKNOWN Alright I I already did a little bit of research after our first meeting where we threw out some ideas and it looks to me that within the budget that we're looking at the uh the whole house idea really isn't gonna be possible . 
UNKNOWN So I'd like your suggestions to come back to the other slidewhere I was saying we we could suggest anything . 
UNKNOWN I'd like the suggestions to be really specific , so that we'll have a list of things we can cross off , not something like you know whole house control what'll be And then I found on the internet from from my research that some extended electronic entertainment control should be possible . 
UNKNOWN At the budget that we're looking at and at the price point we're looking at , we should be able to make it work the T_V_ , the V_C_R_ , the stereo set um maybe something else cute like a coffee pot or one other appliance or maybe a lamp . 
UNKNOWN Uh okay , can can I at this point interject um something ? 
UNKNOWN I have to wind up ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , sure . 
UNKNOWN Um we have received instruction from higher up that certain things should not be uh considered . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um the one thing for example something to eliminate maybe that's the teletext , because that's sort of outdated with the internet , and according to to higher management the it should only control the T_V_ , mostly because they feel that it's too comp complex a task to um to to include other things , and they are concerned with the time to market . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Complicated , yeah , of course . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Of course , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um and the and the third thing that they wanna make sure um that their that the corporate image is being maintained , and that the corporate colour and design are being used on the product , so that it's easy that that that they can be easily identified as a product of of of the company , and that there's no mistake that it could be somebody else who is bringing this out . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so that's something Okay so Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So I just wanted to interject this here so we're not getting too much off track here with uh with the things we wanna look at . 
UNKNOWN These were instructions from higher up so we have to eliminate uh these things , so it's only gonna be T_V_ , but the one thing maybe that could be um eliminated is the teletext uh idea . 
UNKNOWN Mm 'kay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Alright , thanks for that . 
UNKNOWN Um alright now other things that I found out on in my research is that the complaints that people have about the remote controls that are out there now . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause a lot of them take too much time to learn how to use , and that was thirty four percent but even more important the thing that we did address in our last meeting that frequently it's lost somewhere in the room . 
UNKNOWN Um so those are two things that we definitely do wanna address , uh we wanna s make it as simple as possible , we wanna make it um obvious and intuitive to use , and then the things about finding it we talked about the a light emitting thing as well as uh maybe a beep , and I think that those are things after my research that we definitely wanna try to incorporate . 
UNKNOWN 'Kay can we go to the next slideplease ? 
UNKNOWN Okay , so , my personal preferences in this um project are really have to concentrate on the sizzle . 
UNKNOWN That is the selling point , the thing that's gonna make it an impulse purchase . 
UNKNOWN Uh because once there's no be-back , well in sales they always say you know , be-backs don't come back . 
UNKNOWN If somebody says , oh I'll come back and get it next week you're dead . 
UNKNOWN They're never gonna come back and buy it . 
UNKNOWN You've gotta make it attractive enough so they buy it now now now w now is a big word in in my bookfor selling this thing . 
UNKNOWN And , in order to make it really sellable we've gotta shorten the learning curve , make sure it's really intuitive and easy to use . 
UNKNOWN We have to have as few buttons as possible , because more buttons is more confusion , so that's why I'm saying , simplicity is good . 
UNKNOWN Finding it's important , obviously you can't use it if you can't find it . 
UNKNOWN So we've gotta concentrate on the features that help you find it , and I've already said this several times but I put it down in writing here , it should be an attractive impulse purchase at twenty five Euros . 
UNKNOWN So it has to have enough value that when somebody looks at it they say , uh twenty five Euros I'm not gonna take that . 
UNKNOWN Has to be so great that they're gonna say , uh twenty five Euros isn't much . 
UNKNOWN Um and then maybe a motto , like we put fashion in electronics might be something we can use in our marketing campaign . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay that's uh about it for me right now . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN And uh who would be next , uh , I guess that would be you . 
UNKNOWN Yeah 'kay . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN You want me to get your slideshow up ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah yeah sure . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
THANKS Thank you . 
UNKNOWN And you are number three ? 
UNKNOWN Number two , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Number two . 
UNKNOWN Yeah exactly . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Uh can you make it uh full screen please ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN No , it's like a well you you have to press here . 
UNKNOWN The cup cup shape here ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah yeah , uh-huh . 
UNKNOWN The thir third . 
UNKNOWN Yeah exactly . 
UNKNOWN There , mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Uh so today I'm going to talk about the working design of the remote controller . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um can you go to the next sli slideplease ? 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN The metal is like uh in a remote controller you have a chip integrated circuit which is like a brain of the remote controller . 
UNKNOWN It takes the power from a battery say a battery it it can be a elec an electric supply like you have to uh like uh switch connec connect connect your remote controller to uh power supply from the you know electricity or something like that . 
UNKNOWN It should be a battery because uh uh remote controller should be like you you you should take it t to wherever you want and then um uh th this integrated circuitry takes energy from the power source and whatever like if you press a button it's like a input for the remote controller and it takes the input and it it transforms into a infro infrared bits and it sends it into the device , like a T_V_ or a air conditioner , something like that so . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Uh a remote controller is specifically designed to a single device . 
UNKNOWN If you want to design it for multiple devices then you should make all the devices compatible with the frequency like uh th the remote controller it sends some bits some uh waves like with a particular frequency the device should know what the frequency is . 
UNKNOWN It should re re recognise the uh waves which are coming from the remote controller and it should take the action like if you press a button channel or something like that then uh the remote uh remote controller will send a send a se send a signal , and the T_V_ it should translate that into like change the channel or something like that , change the volume control and uh so uh I think it's hard to design a remote controller for multiple uh devices . 
UNKNOWN Signal . 
UNKNOWN Receive . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Multi-purpose . 
UNKNOWN Yeah well that's already been eliminated by management , so we're off the hook . 
UNKNOWN Yo and it's yeah but it's so . 
UNKNOWN Uh yeah . 
CONFUSION Um . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN So uh user interface controls the chip and accordingly the messages like there should be a user user in interface like you know switch pad or something like that buttons should be there . 
UNKNOWN So uh you can control whatever you want , you want to change the channel you want to control the volume you you want to uh mute uh mute the uh T_V_ or you want to have a child lock or you want to do some operations there's a there should be some device to tell what to do to the uh in uh integrated circuit so that the integrated circuit can s send the signals and T_V_ can perform the actions . 
UNKNOWN Mm okay . 
UNKNOWN So can you go to the next slideplease ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So I I just would like to uh add some extra features to the remote controller um I think these are the very simple features and uh they don't take much uh uh much of the um um investment also , it's like el the text or buttons which uh which are there on the uh remote controller they those we can make uh um like fluorescent uh they'll be like light emitting if it is dark so that you can find your remote controller if it is dark . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN And ther there should be a beep if many buttons are pressed if suppose a child is playing with the remote controller and a and she she or he is pressing the buttons all at the time then there should be a beep saying that it's this this is not a a you know a a action , there can be no action taking to that so . 
UNKNOWN And there should be a child lock , like uh uh you should be able to lock your remote controller so that uh um whatever buttons are pressed by a child they can't be like y you i you if you have ki kids and all then they'll be pl playing with the remote controllers so can lock the remote controller . 
UNKNOWN If make it useable for more than one device it's a it's hard but I think it's possible but it uh yeah yeah yeah so it's it's okay , yeah , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah well yeah well that has been e that has been eliminated , so that's that's unfortunately a moot point now . 
UNKNOWN Well we already eliminated that . 
UNKNOWN Eliminated . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN And uh different shapes that we can do like uh we can have you know a all animals shapes or you know comfortable uh whi which can fit into your hands and um so that uh Yeah , yeah , yeah and colours also , different colours , and No no no , it won't uh I don't think it will be like , you can have you know for uh if you want ther there to be more Yeah yeah . 
UNKNOWN Now that's good from a marketing point of view , the fun the fun shape . 
UNKNOWN And that you you say that won't add too much to the budget ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah I It just build a mould basically and uh you know . 
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm colours . 
UNKNOWN To d the shape is uh Do you think there's any chance of um having ser in having basically the same machine with the same buttons but maybe several different shapes ? 
UNKNOWN It's it's just a s shape so it doesn't matter . 
UNKNOWN Yes exactly . 
UNKNOWN As the budget we're looking at if you build one mould I don't think that's going to make a big difference whether it's gonna be square or Oh yes . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah that is also possible I uh yeah I I yeah . 
UNKNOWN Is that gonna be a possible ? 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause that might help with the marketing . 
UNKNOWN I think I think we will have to look at the budget on that but I think in principle that that would be that would be kind of fun , you know . 
UNKNOWN Yeah that will be Yeah yeah . 
UNKNOWN Because we had something sort of sexy for adults and we could have something sort of silly for children or a little animal shape or in a or a little elephant so they can remember where it is . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Silly for children . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , for children , yeah exactly . 
UNKNOWN Like an animal or Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Like a doll , or Yes . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's what , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , exactly . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And and the butto buttons also I think if you want to have more features in your remote controller then there should be more buttons . 
UNKNOWN If there are more buttons then it will be more complicated . 
UNKNOWN If you have less features then your remote controller won't be attractive , so I think uh we need to make some buttons which are which are like um uh f in uh in intended for two or three operations , like if you press one button in one mode then it will change the channel , if you press the other button in another mode it will change the colour . 
UNKNOWN So if you want to have less buttons we can have that option but I think it will complicate the matter more I think so . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Well , I think I think that that's something that we'll have to discuss um with the User Interface person because I think there's a lot of argument to be made for one button for one feature . 
UNKNOWN Yep , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN Because I think one of the things were complaining about in my what I found out in my research is when they complained about how hard it is to learn a new one . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN The changing modes was something I mean you and I , all f all four of us we work with computers all the time , changing modes is nothing for us , but people who N and And that's and that's the kind of thing people learn by feel , and um you don't feel the mode change . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , it's like you know yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , a little elderly , a little arthritic hand you know , and and it's a small button and and it they don't press it exactly you know something else happens n not their favourite channel comes up but something else and they're very frustrated you know . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , yes . 
UNKNOWN Something else . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah you don't us yeah yeah , usually . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So um maybe having buttons be various shapes might be a help too . 
UNKNOWN Yeah shapes also , different shapes . 
UNKNOWN You know , like the a triangle is for the volume and a square is for changing channels , so that people can uh develop a tactile sense of it . 
UNKNOWN Yeah that will Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Channels . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But we'll get to that with you . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah , and also text should be very clear so that there there won't be any ambiguities and uh So yeah . 
UNKNOWN Mm , mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN That's right , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Now that's a good point . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And uh display clock i if you want more features then we can display a clock it I I don't think it will take any money extra money because anyway we have an integrated circuit I think we can just definitely fit that feature into the circuit so it's Yeah , and we display a clock . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's that's a good that's a good one , because the clock would be really friendly , and and when is your favourite show coming on and Yeah , and a lot of time there's not a clock on the screen , and you have to go somewhere but you just wanna look at the news for a minute. 
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm , mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Mm yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , and then you can just see your remote controller yeah yeah yeah so Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN Yeah you're sitting there already or maybe you have no other uh Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah that's that's good , the clock is good . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Uh can you go to the next slideplease ? 
UNKNOWN Uh components uh the main components we need for uh it ha like buttons and uh underneath that there should be switch . 
UNKNOWN And uh bulbs . 
UNKNOWN Like uh we can have a bulb like whenever we are operating a remote controller or uh whenever the T_V_ is on suppose , then the remote controller should automatically have a b s light . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Then it will be like if you switch on your T_V_ through anoth another source , not from through a remote remote controller and you you lost your remote controller maybe you can find with the light . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Maybe we can have that . 
UNKNOWN Whenever the T_V_ is on , remote controller will have a light . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN And then uh infrared bulbs . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um this is like uh when it is dark . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN And battery , there should be a battery for power supply , and a chip , chip which is like a brain to the remote controller which does all the operations , and wires connecting all chips , which is uh lights , everything , so there should be wires . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN And uh uh of course there should be a case where we can keep all the things and , you know different shapes or whatever it is there should be a case to put to give a shape . 
UNKNOWN To keep the remote ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Case . 
UNKNOWN A case holder . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , holder . 
UNKNOWN A holder remote holder . 
UNKNOWN Holder , yeah , mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um uh can you move onto the next slide. 
UNKNOWN Um next sli slideplease . 
UNKNOWN Um I have referred the site uh the homepage of the um our website , uh from where I have uh uh I got s few points . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN That's it , that's it from me now . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So it um we should visit this site and have a look at uh what's up there ? 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Or Okay . 
UNKNOWN Well , you don't have to . 
UNKNOWN Uh it's not like that , I have referred the pageto get new ideas or like what can be the working design to how it works and all and so and so . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So it might be helpful if we had a look at that . 
UNKNOWN Yeah if you want . 
CONFIRMATION Okay , thank you . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , it's okay . 
UNKNOWN Could you go back to that slidewhere she had that uh s slideup Betsy ? 
UNKNOWN Uh , it's actually there now , there on the screen . 
UNKNOWN This one ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , okay , thank you . 
UNKNOWN And Francine ? 
UNKNOWN Participant two . 
UNKNOWN You are number two ? 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN No no , I'm three . 
UNKNOWN You're three . 
UNKNOWN I can make it full ? 
UNKNOWN Would you want it full full screen ? 
UNKNOWN Yes yes yes . 
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN As uh User Interface Designer I did a little research to find out what are the features which a user would like to have on their remote . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah can you please go onto the next slide? 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So I found out that uh but uh the main purpose of a remote is to uh f control the function of a television at a far off distance at remote distance . 
UNKNOWN Now for that , uh a remote controller should have a switch on off button by which a user can sit anywhere in the room in front of the T_V_ and he can control the functionalities different functionalities of the T_V_ . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN There should be a signal uh something like a radio wave or a infrared light or a LED which can be used to change the different functionalities in the television if the user wants to uh change the channels or increase the volume he can change it . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Now there should be some timer to set for viewing a particular a particular programme or switching on and off a uh a particular programme according to the user choice . 
UNKNOWN On the on on the remote . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN So if if he want to view a particular programme at say nine o'clock he can set the time , and the T_V_ will automatically it will switch on at that particular time . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So he can use that kind of uh uh properties of features and then there should be a child lock system if a particular channel is not to be viewed by a particular uh for a certain age , then the parents can lock that particular channel so that the ch children cannot view that channel . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN By your child , mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN And uh the uh the uh and the one of the feature a user would like to have is the compactness of the co remote . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Uh t the remote should be compact and it should ha it should have as many buttons as possible for controlling different functionalities of the T_V_ television . 
UNKNOWN And um uh as uh uh this is my personal preference that it should be in the shape of a T_ in alphabet for more compactability . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN And uh and uh and it is one more point which I noted it down , like uh the material which which which is used for remotes should be human friendly it should not cause any skin disease or something some al allergy to either children or to um ad adult person . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Mm , 'kay . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN And it should have an uh it can have an alarm clock a a person if some if somebody wants to get up at around eight eight P_M_ then he can set the time and it can be used as an alarm clock , and I don't think it will cost much to set an alarm clock inside a remote . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , sure . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN If there is a clock then there can be a alarm clock . 
UNKNOWN And an alarm clock , yeah that should that should be okay . 
UNKNOWN Yes , and as John Reece said the buttons can be , uh can me we can use the fluorescence to light up the buttons so different uh buttons will glow differently . 
UNKNOWN So in even in the dark the user can know what buttons to use to switch on a particular channel . 
UNKNOWN And uh uh the design of the uh um remote should be in such a way that there should not be any sharp projections so that if a child plays with a remote , he uh he should not be harmed in any way . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN And findings , uh I found out uh y um on different sites that uh there are different remotes which can be used , there are remotes which use the infrared for controlling the different functionalities , there are remotes which use the radio waves to control the functions and there are uh So uh there you have different uh types of remotes for different light source which are used which can be used for controlling the different functionalities of a television . 
UNKNOWN Next slide. 
UNKNOWN And these are my few personal preferences like it can be used for a multipurpose use . 
UNKNOWN Not , uh no uh like it can it can be used as a T_V_ control as plus an alarm clock to set an alarm a timing and it should have a child lock , and then to save electricity uh there should not be uh much s move uh lots of circuits and all that . 
UNKNOWN And if a person if if if parents wants the television to be switched off by ten o'clock then it should be switched off ten o at ten o'clock automatically , so that nobody else comes later and use it . 
UNKNOWN It's like a t okay , it's like a timer it's like a lock to the television . 
UNKNOWN Timer , yeah , mm-hmm , mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Timer . 
UNKNOWN Yeah and then you can use a timer as well . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN Yeah that's it . 
UNKNOWN Uh okay , now I have On my slideshow basically we already we have already done the agenda, and uh on the closing uh basically there will be lunch break and all that . 
UNKNOWN However uh the decision we have to take in this meeting is who is our target group . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN And uh what function , working design , how how does it work . 
UNKNOWN So these are the two things we should come up wit with . 
UNKNOWN So uh the first thing is pro maybe a little easier on uh who is our target group . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN I guess in many ways everybody . 
UNKNOWN Everybody who has a T_V_ . 
UNKNOWN Mm , T_V_ , yeah . 
UNKNOWN T_V_ television we was . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , and I think today there are probably not many people who don't have a T_V_ . 
UNKNOWN Don't T_V_ , yeah . 
UNKNOWN There are a few but in general not . 
UNKNOWN Now , talking about the target group which is in a sense everybody , but I think within the target group we have subgroups . 
UNKNOWN We have we have earlier it was mentioned about um for example elderly people who have limited function with their fingers and hands , so I think that's uh one group that's certainly important . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um then we have just the nervous people who can never press a little button on anything um unless it's really very clear . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And uh I don't know how much we want to cater to children's use . 
UNKNOWN I mean that's a question um whether that's important that children can really use it or not . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN So this these are just some thoughts I have on it , and um I dunno what you feel about whether we can just say we have one target group and for this one target group we're gonna design this one thing or whether we're looking at what we like we we talking about different shapes , whether that different shape also includes maybe different uh buttons uh for different groups . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Well you know there's the old motto , children under six never shop alone . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So if you've designed something that's very attractive to children um the mummy please mummy please um you know we want it now we wanna go to the store and see it um that has uh a lot of marketing pull . 
UNKNOWN That has a lot of that has a lot of appeal but I think uh I'm I'm talking about the functionality now on it whether we're looking at different groups . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN I think the children issue can be addressed with the shape and with colours . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN That's right . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Different colours . 
UNKNOWN You know , like you make it nice and pink , fluorescent , banana colour or whatever you know yeah , for example you know . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN You can make a banana shaped one . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN But the question is really , who is our target group . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Do we look at one target group ? 
UNKNOWN And with the twenty five Euros you know can we can we afford to have uh I'm asking the technical people here whether um to look at sort of subgroups with maybe different buttons for each group how much would that throw us out of the cost we are supposed to respect ? 
UNKNOWN Respect . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN No uh generally we can we can design a remote which is mainly for people with uh f age from ten to um forty and and then we can add on uh specific functional buttons for children as well as the elderly people or the people wit with who have nervous problems , yes . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN With with Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN We can design different remotes for different people , like for aged people there will be big buttons and you know . 
UNKNOWN Well that's that's Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But in a family in a family there will be a aged person , children and a middle aged but they cannot buy three different remotes . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Children and everybody , yeah . 
UNKNOWN They would like to buy just one and um just one which can be used all the three uh Cost effective . 
UNKNOWN Yeah of course that we can do , but specifically if y if like elderly people want big buttons then you can't really make a bi big remote controller so maybe specifically you can design a big con remote controller for elderly and for children , like in a different you know . 
UNKNOWN What about the electronics ? 
UNKNOWN That's not really gonna change much , is it ? 
UNKNOWN No , it it doesn't cost , yeah . 
UNKNOWN That that w that won't change much , will it uh ? 
UNKNOWN No The the quest the question to be addressed here is only who is the target group and how will it function , and I think the how will it function is probably the question of the buttons you know , within the target group or subgroups . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Doesn't doesn't doesn't matter . 
UNKNOWN I d I wouldn't think so . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN The question is only whether our budget will allow to have more than one design in a sense . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I mean the basic design I understand will be the same , but the question is how much will that set us back if let's say uh forty percent we make large buttons and the rest we make regular buttons for example . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So that remains to s to be seen but uh the target group as a whole is is basically everybody with a T_V_ . 
UNKNOWN That's right , and can we can we is it even feasible to make one one remote control with something for everyone , or would we have to use the same electronics and make three different shapes ? 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , well that's that's the question . 
UNKNOWN Um the same electronics and basically all that's gonna be different is the plastic case . 
UNKNOWN Hmm hmm . 
UNKNOWN And in that case we could probabl moulded plastic isn't all that expensive is it ? 
UNKNOWN Um you as an industrial person ? 
UNKNOWN Uh no . 
UNKNOWN Mm , I I I don't think no . 
UNKNOWN Well maybe there's there's an idea you know t the new for example new portable phones ? 
UNKNOWN It's not . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN They have like removable plastic cases , so you can have a striped one or you can have a fluorescent blue one , or whatever , and maybe something like that , that in each package you know you have you you have you have for example uh you have let's say a fluorescent blue on it but then you have uh another colour or stripe whatever that already comes in a package . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Well there's a real idea yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN And then if people really want more colours they can buy it separately . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Yeah , like for mobile phones we have uh different you know covers , like designsand all so that w we can have that . 
UNKNOWN You know , yes . 
UNKNOWN Um Yes . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN That's right , and but like if if then everybody is is is tired of the fluorescent blue and of the striped or whatever they have as another one in the package , then they can go to the store and for a few uh Francs or Euros whatever they can buy an alternate package with another two colours in it you know for example you know . 
UNKNOWN Uh yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN An alternate package . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN But uh yeah I I have a doubt like will it be cost wise effective if we if we design a remote having all the uh different features for different people or designing three different um remotes for three different categories of people . 
UNKNOWN Well I think I think the idea here is to uh to to d design one remote and what the only change is gonna be um the funct d t yeah uh the functional functional cosmetics if you want to put it that way , um having maybe larger buttons or buttons that light up or buttons that are slightly differently shaped for people uh either for children um Five minutes that was I guess tha that's the old message . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but uh Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well I think we can only aff , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Cosmetic . 
UNKNOWN Of th okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Warning , finish meeting now . 
UNKNOWN Finish meeting now . 
UNKNOWN Um um . 
UNKNOWN Well we may have to come back to one or two of these points at our next meeting but um Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , maybe , yeah , yeah . 
UNKNOWN But I think I I think to sum it up the target group is basically everybody . 
UNKNOWN If we do some more research , maybe we . 
UNKNOWN If money permits we can address some features for some subgroups within that . 
UNKNOWN Okay , mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Hmm yeah , I think maybe seventy percent is a unique uh uh remote controller and thirty percent is yeah it's sort of like yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay but we have to l Okay , fair enough . 
UNKNOWN Do we agree , do we ? 
UNKNOWN Do we agree on on that in principle , like money will tell whether we will be able to do that or not . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah , of course , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN Okay ? 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So now I understand it's lunch break . 
UNKNOWN And um . 
UNKNOWN So that's what we will do . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So hank you very much . 
THANKS Thank you . 
UNKNOWN And we'll see you after lunch . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Hello everyone . 
GREETING Hi . 
GREETING Hi . 
GREETING Hi . 
UNKNOWN Um how uh how we doing ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , good . 
UNKNOWN Uh first we going uh over the minutesof the last meeting , more or less . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um in the last meeting uh the marketing manager had presented uh her method of working , meaning gathering i suggestions from everyone to see how she best could market uh this this product at the within the budget uh that was given . 
UNKNOWN Uh in general the idea is that it should be something that is not difficult to use . 
UNKNOWN Um it's also an item that people lose a lot . 
UNKNOWN So we should address that . 
UNKNOWN And , of course , it should be something s s that is very simple to use . 
UNKNOWN In addition to that to make it sell , of course , uh the marketing manager w wishes that it be very attractive , or like she says put some sizzle into it in one way or another so that the people are buying it now because , in particular with smaller items , that's a very important fact , 'cause um if they say , well , I go home and think about it , that won't work . 
UNKNOWN Um also mentioned was it should be uh it should have a very short learning curve . 
UNKNOWN And maybe it could be sold by using a slogan . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Our technical manager has then said that she feels it should have a chip that has infra-red bits and it has an interface controls w interface that controls the chip . 
UNKNOWN Therefore , messages uh will be controlled in the same manner . 
UNKNOWN There should be extra features like lid buttons , maybe a beep . 
UNKNOWN If too many buttons are pressed , mm uh uh child lock um and uh maybe a display clock so that people could um you could see the time , you know , what show they want to watch . 
UNKNOWN Also mentioned was uh maybe different shapes . 
UNKNOWN So the components of the thing should be button , bulbs , infra infra-red bulbs , battery , chips , wires , and maybe some kind of a holder uh for the for the uh item . 
UNKNOWN Francino who is our um interface designer um uh has mentioned that the that it , of course , should have an on-off button , and also has mentioned an interesting feature that it should have maybe a channel lock . 
UNKNOWN Interface designer . 
UNKNOWN Particularly with maybe small children that they couldn't uh watch a channel that is undesirable . 
UNKNOWN It should be compact . 
UNKNOWN Her personal favourite was it should be T-shaped . 
UNKNOWN And maybe have an anar alarm-clock . 
UNKNOWN And the material should possibly be not of non-allergic nature . 
UNKNOWN Uh the different systems uh that exist are infra-red or radio-waves . 
UNKNOWN Uh maybe it should have uh electri electrici electricity saving feature . 
UNKNOWN And even possibly a timer to so that people can program their favourite uh uh program on th right from the remote . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN Uh are we all in agreement that that's about what we discussed last time ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I think that pretty much is it . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Okay , then we I'm looking for three presentations. 
UNKNOWN And uh I don't know whether the order matters much uh , I don't I don't think so , so whoever w wants Yeah , okay . 
UNKNOWN Okay , I can start first . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Now my slide, please . 
UNKNOWN Okay , your slides. 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Oh , come on , close already . 
UNKNOWN And that's number two , right ? 
UNKNOWN Three . 
UNKNOWN Three . 
UNKNOWN Participant three . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Now as an interface designer , I would give more emphasis on the interface , how the remote looks like so that it is sellable , it is attractive to customers . 
UNKNOWN Next , please . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Now the function of a remote is to send messages to the television . 
UNKNOWN This messages could be uh switch on-off message or switch to next channel message or swapping the channels or switching onto a particular channel , like you can have the numbers one , two , three , four , up to nine . 
UNKNOWN Nine what ? 
UNKNOWN Nine channel uh switches ? 
UNKNOWN Pardon me ? 
UNKNOWN Nine channel switches ? 
UNKNOWN Is Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yes , nine numbers . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN And then you have swapping of uh button by which using which you can swap the channels if you don't want to see the third channel you can swap it to the fourth channel or vice versa . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Then it should have a next button , and next button channel by which you can keep on uh v uh mm eh scrolling the channels one by one . 
UNKNOWN Going to the nex next . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Next slide, please . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Then you should have a button which should which ca which can be used for increasing or decreasing the volume . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Then , there should be a button which can give subtitles for a particular program which is going on a television . 
UNKNOWN For example , if you are watching a French program and you would like to have a subtitles in English , then there should be a channel which can trigger this mechanism in the television so that the user can see uh the the subtitles on the screen . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Then there should d uh there should be some buttons which can control features like the colour , colour of the picture , the contrast , sharpness , brightness of the picture . 
UNKNOWN Now there should be a memory switch . 
UNKNOWN There should be a mute button . 
UNKNOWN Suddenly if if if uh uh viewer he gets a telephone call , and if he want he doesn't want to switch off the uh T_V_ , but he he can reduce the sound , he can bring the volume down and he can watch he can uh while talking he can watch the T_V_ . 
UNKNOWN Now the most important feature I would like to have in my remote would be the speech recognition feature . 
UNKNOWN It's an integrated progra programmable sample sensor speaker unit . 
UNKNOWN So a remote can be th can be uh designed which can have the voice recognisers , you can record your own voice which can be recognised by as voice recogniser in the television , for example , if you want to see we if you want to see the ninth channel if you say just say ninth channel , uh th now the the uh yeah , the remote will automatically it will switch to the ninth channel . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So the T_V_ will have some recogniser which will recognise the user's voice and accordingly it will change its functionalities . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So this is one of the very important feature a remote control can have . 
UNKNOWN So this is one one of the interface which can be created . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN A very simple interface which has all the t uh uh important features . 
UNKNOWN Then , please , next slide. 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Then , these are some of the remotes which are different in shape and colour , but they have many buttons . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So uh sometimes the user finds it very difficult to recognise which button is for what function and all that . 
UNKNOWN So you can you can design an interface which is very simple , and which is user-friendly . 
UNKNOWN Even a kid can use that . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So can you go on t t uh to the next slide. 
UNKNOWN Yeah , so this is one of the interface or one of the remote which has this vi voice recogniser . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN And this has multi-purpose use , it can be used for T_V_ , it can be used for cable-satellite , it can be used for V_C_R_ , D_V_D_s and audio . 
UNKNOWN And this has in-built voice recogniser . 
UNKNOWN Can you go on to the next slide? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , now this is an interface for a chil uh for a remote uh uh which a child can use . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Uh this is user-friendly , it's very attractive and uh children can use it as well as they can play with it . 
UNKNOWN And this comes with different colours , different shapes . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN And this this uh child uh interface has minimum buttons and all the important uh buttons are there in this small , compact , attractive child interface . 
UNKNOWN Next slide, please . 
UNKNOWN Now this is a big over-sized remote which cannot be misplaced or it's impossible to misplace . 
UNKNOWN You don't know me . 
UNKNOWN this . 
UNKNOWN I could lose that in a minute. 
UNKNOWN So this is No this is a very big , you cannot misplace it anywhere . 
UNKNOWN So this is a jumbo universal remote control and it's impossible to im misplace or lose . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN This i this is one such interface which can be created . 
UNKNOWN And the personal preference uh would be a spe uh uh to incorporate speech recognisers uh which will respond to user's voice for a particular uh function . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
THANKS Thank you , that's Mm yes . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Okay , thank you very much . 
UNKNOWN Uh any comments on uh her presentation? 
UNKNOWN Well , um looks like we still have quite a choice of things out there . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um what uh I'm No suggestion's bad . 
UNKNOWN But uh we're gonna have to narrow it down a little more . 
UNKNOWN I don't think that we can get uh The T-shape is good , the child one is good , the too big to misplace , I think it's just funny . 
UNKNOWN Um I don't think that's gonna be our impulse purchase at the checkout counter . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I I th I think No , I think the these are her presentations, but uh as far as the decision making we getting to that after after but if I just wanted to know whether anybody had any any anything to add to her presentation. 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN It's it's gonna be a little bit too unwieldy . 
UNKNOWN Yeah mm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Have to come back to that later . 
UNKNOWN We can . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN No , I think her presentationwas good , and she really explored all the options . 
UNKNOWN Mm right . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Ho who wants to go next um ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , maybe . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Okay , and you Uh okay . 
UNKNOWN Participant two . 
UNKNOWN Uh the next one , sorry . 
UNKNOWN Oops . 
UNKNOWN It's it was the old one . 
UNKNOWN Components . 
UNKNOWN The components design . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um this time I'm I'm going to um concentrate more on the components and the technical side of the remote controller design . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Uh , can you go on to the next slide, please . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN I have just brief uh down few uh components which we require for the remote control uh construction . 
UNKNOWN Uh the first one is case to keep all the components like integrated circuit , battery , etcetera , etcetera , it's like Uh it can be a plastic one , hard plastic , so that it can be strong , even if you just uh uh , you know , if you if it falls down , then it doesn't break . 
UNKNOWN So it should be strong . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN And uh uh there are no harmful materials used in that . 
UNKNOWN And it should be recyclable . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Uh and uh , yeah , and also uh using of colouring compon components like uh if we want to have different colours , blue , red , green , so uh uh we have to use uh some colouring compone compone components . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Good point . 
UNKNOWN And uh the second important thing is uh uh uh integrated circuit . 
UNKNOWN Uh which uh we can use a highly sophisticated one because it's like the it's like the heart of the remote controller . 
UNKNOWN If it is not efficient then everything wi is going to be uh like um the lef ess less efficient so it you should we should have a highly sophisticated one . 
UNKNOWN And it should be resistant to high as well as uh low temperatures . 
UNKNOWN Suppose if it is thirty-eight degrees outside forty degrees outside , it should it should uh be able to re uh resist the uh temperature uh uh highs and uh high temperatures and low temperatures . 
UNKNOWN And uh it should be with uh um equipped with timer and alarm facility . 
UNKNOWN And the uh other component we should uh we have in the remote controller is a resistor uh which is like uh uh i it is very very much important for the electricity uh flow through through through the uh remote controller and uh also a capacitor which is a b which is a m I think it's it's like a battery , capacitor . 
UNKNOWN Can you go on to the next slide, please ? 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Uh a diode , a transistor , a resonator , these are all this uh technical uh electri electronic compons uh components which are which we have to use in a remote controller . 
UNKNOWN A battery uh , I would like to suggest one thing uh if we uh if we will be able to make a res rechargeable battery then we sh we need not go for a high performance battery , even if it is a low performance battery it ca it can't l it can't charge much . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN It it it's not a high voltage battery . 
UNKNOWN Then also we can If it is a rechargeable one , then uh people can use it for a long time , so in that way we can cut cut the cost , but w uh uh that we have to make the battery as rechargeable one . 
UNKNOWN And we we have a circuit board uh in a remote controller . 
UNKNOWN Can you go to the next slide, please . 
UNKNOWN And how it works , how the remote controller works . 
UNKNOWN When you press a button Thank you . 
UNKNOWN Go away . 
UNKNOWN Uh when you press a button , when you do that , you complete a specific connection that means when you when you press a button there will be a s a small circuit underneath the button , and it will send some signals through the wires , and then uh the chip will send start connection and knows that which button is pressed . 
UNKNOWN Suppose you have pressed channel one button , number one you have pressed , then the uh chip will know that the number one button was pressed . 
UNKNOWN It pros produces a mors morse code line signal specific to that button . 
UNKNOWN Every button , every individual button , has its own morse code . 
UNKNOWN Suppose uh the uh user has pressed butto button one , then it will have a spe the circuit will generate a specific morse code to b that that button , and the transistor will amplify the signal and send then to the L_E_D_ which translates the signal into infrared light . 
UNKNOWN Like you have got a signal by pressing a button . 
UNKNOWN That's a d a morse code has been generated by the integrated circuit . 
UNKNOWN Now , that signal , that morse code , has to be amplified by the transistor . 
UNKNOWN That is the use of transist transistor we which we use in the remote controller . 
UNKNOWN It will amplify the signal and it will send it to the L_E_D_ and which translates the signal into an infra infrared bits . 
UNKNOWN The sensor on the T_V_ can see the infrared light , and seeing the signal seeing the signal re it reacts appropriately , that when it sees the amplified mo morse code signal , then it will uh it will uh know which uh what what action it has to uh do . 
UNKNOWN Then it will do the appropriate action . 
UNKNOWN So uh this is how the remote controller works . 
UNKNOWN It works . 
UNKNOWN Can you go to the next slide, please . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I have few pictures . 
UNKNOWN When you look at the uh um remote controller uh it's it's it this is a normal remote controller . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN And to the next slide, please . 
UNKNOWN And where we had a a few buttons and all . 
UNKNOWN And uh if you open the remote controller you have this circui circuit board and few electronic components , like you can see a chip there which is having eighteen pins , and also a capac uh a capacitor , three resistors and also a resonator uh um mm yeah , and di and a diode transistor . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN The electronic components uh all of the electronic components have all those uh things like a chip and d diode transistors an Yeah , di um can y uh you can see the T_A_ double one eight three five labelled uh chip um . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Mm yes . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN Uh you can also see the uh uh the green two green things are uh these are they are they are resistors , and uh just beside that you can see a transistor , and a uh uh cylinder shape , uh that one is a capacitor . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Uh and also there are uh um resistors uh sorry , ther there is a diode . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Can you go go on to the next slide. 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So uh this is the circuit board . 
UNKNOWN The green one is a circuit board . 
UNKNOWN Actually , uh building a circuit bo board is pretty pretty uh easy and also it's a it's a l l inexpensive . 
UNKNOWN Uh it's it costs less than what you printon a paper, because uh uh when you when you are building uh some circuits some um uh circuits and also wires , it's it's better to go for printing , because uh you can build these kind of k circuit boards on a on a bulk and it's just printing , nothing like uh , you know , you don't need to use wires and all . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN It's not exactly wires we are using . 
UNKNOWN It's just printing something on a board . 
UNKNOWN Tha tho those prints will acti act as wires and ci uh circuits . 
UNKNOWN So th that green uh thing is a circuit board , and also you can see uh there are b s like uh um access for buttons , like when you press a button , the circuit under the button will be activated uh th it will it will he get some signals from it and it will uh it will ch its ch se send a signal signals to the , yeah , um integrated circuit . 
UNKNOWN Transmit . 
UNKNOWN Can you go to the next slide, please . 
UNKNOWN Uh so this is these are the circuits un underneath the buttons . 
UNKNOWN Uh can you see the black uh , round marks ? 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN They they are the circuits . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN Next , please . 
UNKNOWN And um like uh we have uh designed uh before we have seen some uh few things like instead off buttons we have some scrolls . 
UNKNOWN Uh b but a b a push-button requires a simple chip underneath it , but whereas a scroll wheel requires normally a regular chip which is a higher price range . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Like for s scrolls we have to go for a sophisticated and and k uh uh uh full a complete chip . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Uh and a as energy source we offer a basic battery , a more ingenious uh hard dynamo , um a kinetic provision of energy , more than what is that you shake casually to provide energy . 
UNKNOWN So that also we can have in a battery , uh or we can use solar sells . 
UNKNOWN Hmm , that's interesting . 
CONFUSION Uh . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh yeah uh the product can be de delivered into different cases . 
UNKNOWN Uh usually , the cases and card flat that w we see usually uh d uh a normal remote controller . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFUSION Um . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And you have more pictures . 
UNKNOWN Uh we have five minutes to the end of the meeting . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , maybe d uh I have just one more slide, I think . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Like we can have a ma material such as plastic , rubber , wood , titanium , but titanium we can't use . 
UNKNOWN Um and also for electronics we can use a simple and regular um re or an advanced chip on the print, um also infra it includes the infrared se sender . 
UNKNOWN Um yeah the uh for the movie just to j develop uh samples and so spe sample speaker . 
CONFIRMATION An Yeah , that's it . 
UNKNOWN It's all for me now , thank you . 
UNKNOWN Okay , well thank you . 
UNKNOWN Any particular comments by anybody ? 
UNKNOWN Uh yeah , on the scroll and the push-button , um ca you can achieve scrolling by repeatedly pushing a button ? 
UNKNOWN No , no , no , th the the the scrolling wheels are different , like you can go for a sw switches like buttons or scrolls , uh which which we used to do before ten ten years before , I think . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Now , nobody uses that because you need you need a a k sophisticated chip and all . 
UNKNOWN So I think it's better we go for uh um ordinary buttons . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN We'll just go for push buttons for in the interest of cost . 
UNKNOWN Yeah uh yeah , push-buttons . 
UNKNOWN Push-buttons . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN We don't have a lot of time left and we will still have to make a decision , and the marketing expert has to present her her thing . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Go right to my first my next slide. 
UNKNOWN Uh okay . 
UNKNOWN Um alright , my method is uh I'm interested in what the competition is doing , and wanna see how we can make ourselves different from the competition , so I've really been looking at the press and the ads that are out there for other remote controllers . 
UNKNOWN I s I spend a lot of time on the internet um surfing around doing the same thing . 
UNKNOWN And then when I'm out um in people's houses or at meetings or anything like that , I try to notice what kind of remote controls people have , and if it's convenient in the conversation I ask about it . 
UNKNOWN And I would encourage you all to do the same . 
UNKNOWN Um and my findings from this is that , you know , small is beautiful . 
UNKNOWN Um people like something that really fits in their hand . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN Simple is beautiful . 
UNKNOWN They don't want to have to squint at small printum , they want buttons whose functions are obvious , and they want um as few buttons as possible , and they don't care for the mode thing . 
UNKNOWN They want each button to do something . 
UNKNOWN And eye-catching is important . 
UNKNOWN It's gotta look cute , it's gotta look appealing . 
UNKNOWN Go ahead , I'm trying to finish fast for you . 
UNKNOWN Um and our preference is , as far as I'm concerned , are we got to get to the market before the competition . 
UNKNOWN Ours has to be look really great and it has to come out before the others , so that we have a leg up on time to sell it and push it before other people get out their Christmas item . 
UNKNOWN And we should develop one or two features we can really dwell on in our ad campaign . 
UNKNOWN If we try to tell people it has too many great features , um the consumer just gets confused and we don't get anywhere . 
UNKNOWN So we've gotta narrow our selection down to li two things , I think , that we gonna say are really great about our our our new product . 
UNKNOWN And I've been looking around um at what designsevery year different things are popular . 
UNKNOWN And in my research this year I found out that fruit and vegetable shapes are really popular . 
UNKNOWN And people are tired of hard plastic and hard metal . 
UNKNOWN They are more back into soft feel , spongy feeling things , things with maybe a little cloth on them . 
UNKNOWN So those are things maybe we wanna look at as far as saleability of the item . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Uh that concludes the presentationof everyone . 
UNKNOWN And what we really have to decide in this meeting is um the concept of the remote . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN And uh so what do we think on the concept of the remote ? 
UNKNOWN You wanna try to come back to yours , and limit yours a bit ? 
UNKNOWN Uh yes , I would like to include this feature which is called as voice recogniser . 
UNKNOWN Y Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So speech recognition is most important as far as you're concerned ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but w Yeah . 
UNKNOWN This could be uh one feature which could be sellable . 
UNKNOWN Yeah h that could that could that could be our star feature . 
UNKNOWN I think that's Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN That that be really good , yeah , I agree with that . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but but I what I'm uh very very much doubtful how how uh far it will work , because a speech recogniser like i it it has its own uh uh problems , issues . 
UNKNOWN Distance problem ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , it's not distance problem it it's recognising a person's voice , like maybe different people will be having different voices , so it like it's uh everything so i So to get a good recogni recognising system , it's a costly thing , I think . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFUSION Uh . 
UNKNOWN Well , you you teach You have to teach uh Okay , before we get too far off here um , the components of the concept is the energy . 
UNKNOWN No , it's it's , uh yeah , it it's like your recording of uh all uh um a question already , and then you're expecting an answer from th For example , you have a T_V_ system , I'm the user and my family members are the user , I will already record uh a question like , uh good morning , like around eight o'clock I want to see the news in the television . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So I'll say just good morning and the T_V_ will switch on . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN It will recognise my voice and will switch on . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN What kind of energy do we foresee ? 
UNKNOWN I think I think battery , and I think we all agreed on that . 
UNKNOWN Battery . 
UNKNOWN Battery . 
UNKNOWN Battery . 
UNKNOWN That that's that's gonna be most cost-effective and the best thing . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay then chip on print. 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN And the case . 
UNKNOWN And I think we all agree on the case , we wanna have something uh maybe bright , colourful . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Bright , colourful , trendy trendy design , and strong . 
UNKNOWN And compact . 
UNKNOWN And also strong . 
UNKNOWN Trendy , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Trendy design and compact . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Trendy design , compact and strong . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN User interface concept , uh interface type , supplements . 
UNKNOWN That will be your area I think , right , Jana . 
CONFUSION Uh . 
UNKNOWN Um like the switches , like we use buttons for user interface . 
UNKNOWN Push-buttons . 
UNKNOWN Put uh k I guess uh for yeah . 
UNKNOWN Push-buttons . 
UNKNOWN And Not sure what they mean by supplements . 
UNKNOWN And Supplements like different types of features buttons , like can have a f mute button or a swapping button . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well , I think that Yeah , or or like her speech recognition would also be a supplement . 
UNKNOWN Oh , like Oh . 
UNKNOWN Her speech recognition feature would be a supplement . 
UNKNOWN A what ? 
UNKNOWN Right , right , right , mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Recogniser . 
UNKNOWN Mm yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so why don't we put down speech recognition if possible pending some more research from our industrial engineer on how expensive that is . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Uh our next meeting will be in thirty minutes , and the uh I_D_ is to this is the individual actions to be taken until then , to have the look and feel design , and uh the U_I_D_ is supposed to uh come up with the user interface design , and the marketing expert with the product evaluation . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN In this phase , the two of you , Jana and Francine , have to work together on a prototype using modelling clay , it says here . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN You will receive specific instructions will be sent to you by your coaches . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um if you have any questions , you know , you you can always uh contact me um or uh or your coach , I suppose . 
UNKNOWN Wherever they're hiding ? 
UNKNOWN Um so um I think we conclude the meeting here and we come back in uh uh thirty minutes , according to our timetable here . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
THANKS Thank you very much . 
THANKS Thank you . 
THANKS Thank you . 
UNKNOWN Well hi everyone again . 
GREETING Hello . 
UNKNOWN Hello Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um like before we uh I have to redo the meetings from n th the minutesfrom the last meeting and so here we go . 
UNKNOWN Uh it was discussed in the last meeting uh which was opened by the presentationfrom the interface um designer that uh looks would be very important on this new remote and um it is to send messages of course to the T_V_ . 
UNKNOWN Designer . 
UNKNOWN It should have nine channel buttons , a next button , volume buttons , subtitle buttons , switch to control features , colour contrast , sharpness etcetera . 
UNKNOWN It should have a memory switch , a mute button in case the telephone rings or something . 
UNKNOWN Uh speech recognition is one of her very f favourite personal uh features she would like see d d to be integrated in this um in this new remote . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Should be child friendly design with few buttons , colourful maybe with s star shaped or other shaped buttons . 
UNKNOWN Um she uh presented also an oversized remote which she guarantees nobody will ever be able to lose . 
UNKNOWN Um that's right . 
UNKNOWN And she was challenged on that point Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN But uh her very f personal favourite really she , she would very much like to see a speech recogniser integrated in this remote . 
UNKNOWN The industrial designer um presented her uh thoughts on the issue . 
UNKNOWN She would like a special case made out of plastic that is very strong , not using any harmful materials , should be recyclable and should be colourful . 
UNKNOWN Should have an integrated circuit board that's highly sophisticated and temperature resistant . 
UNKNOWN She would like to see a timer and or alarm facility integrated . 
UNKNOWN Uh technically this thing would also have a resistor and a capacitor , diode transistor , resonator , and if possible a rechargeable battery . 
UNKNOWN Uh and of course a circuit board . 
UNKNOWN And how it would works , you press the button , the chip is morse morse code related relays the uh to the generat to the generator amplification and uh the circuit board is very inexpensive to build and so she thinks this is a great feature uh to to to consider . 
UNKNOWN She would like uh this whole thing should be push buttons with a simple chip uh scrolling method is more expensive and not that practical anymore . 
UNKNOWN Should be battery operated and of course she would have the special cases . 
UNKNOWN The marketing expert uh who has to finally come up with to to to market this product has been watching the competition , has done some research on the internet and also has used h her personal observations to come up with the fact that such a remote sh should be small , easy to use and it should be eye catching . 
UNKNOWN From her point of view of course one of the most important facts is that we should get to market before our competition does . 
UNKNOWN To do that uh maybe one or two features should be developed on which we could dwell on or in other words on which our campaign could be built on . 
UNKNOWN Too many new features or too many points would only confuse matter . 
UNKNOWN So we prefer to have one or two features that can be really uh driven home . 
UNKNOWN Um it should have a fruit and vegetable design and should have a soft feel . 
UNKNOWN She feels that's really what people want today . 
UNKNOWN And the decision that we took last time was that uh the special feature we would like to see is a speech recogniser , the energy should be battery uh should be on a chip , should be trendy design , compact and strong , and should have buttons . 
UNKNOWN And that concludes the presentationfrom the last minutesfrom the last meeting . 
UNKNOWN Now uh we are ready for the presentationof the prototype . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Just the look like , the button part I'll explain . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh so this is our what uh we have made . 
UNKNOWN This is a model of the remote control which we are going to build . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Uh this is us in a snail shape so uh it it is attractive um and it's it's blue in colour uh bright and uh it has yellow buttons and all the different colour buttons so it is a uh uh a looks-wise it is beautiful . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Uh and also compact in shape . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Uh um and also i it it will be easily fit into into the hands and you can access all the buttons easily . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Good . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , oops , sorry . 
UNKNOWN You used to have all the buttons Oh that's good , no , that's nice and friendly . 
UNKNOWN Um yeah and um uh the material which we are going to use for the case is uh plastic and uh w which which is s strong um uh and also uh for the Um the material is plastic and uh for the buttons it is uh s soft rubber um and als yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah because uh uh you'll be touching the buttons more so it is soft when you touch it . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm , mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN And then um uh for the for the led , for the light emitting diode it is a fluorescent green and it's a a it is a bulb like an ordinary infrared . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN And and the button button's part uh will be explained by F Francina . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Now the um we decided upon including certain features on our remote . 
UNKNOWN Now these features includes the s um signal emitting uh signal it's the led or L_E_D_ the infrared . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , okay , mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm , mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Now uh we have included the switch on and off button . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Now we have included another feature that is the mute button on the side of the model . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Then we have included one to nine buttons for controlling the programmes the different channels . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN We have also included two buttons for increasing or decreasing the volume . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN And we have also included two buttons for scrolling up and scrolling down the programme channels . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Now our our model also contains a button which is called as the menu button . 
UNKNOWN What kind of button ? 
UNKNOWN Menu button . 
UNKNOWN Menu ? 
UNKNOWN Uh menu th menu , uh one one . 
UNKNOWN Yes , menu At the centre we have included a button which is fluorescent green colour and this is the menu button which will control the colour , sharpness , brightness of this uh picture . 
UNKNOWN Menu button . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Of the screen . 
UNKNOWN Mm , mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN We have also included a button which is called as the swapping button . 
UNKNOWN Now this is uh a special , special feature which we have included . 
UNKNOWN Now this button is an elongated shaped button and this is slightly flexible so if it is turned towards the right it will take to the previous channel , if it is turned towards the right it will take to the next channel . 
UNKNOWN It will take the user to the previous and the next channel so this is a swapping button . 
UNKNOWN The next channel in the numeric pattern , or Yeah , mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN No , swapping is if if example you're you're watching the second channel and then you go to the tenth channel and if you want to go back to the second channel you can swap , this button . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Okay , okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN And at the end , it this remote has inbuilt voice recogniser which c which will recognise the user's voice and then it'll act accordingly . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So this is our proposed model . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Now the marketing expert has to give her suggestion whether it'll be sellable or it'll be cost effective . 
UNKNOWN Tell , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay , well um what what I really like a lot about it is that you can reach the whole thing with one thumb , that you can really hold it in one h you don't need two hands and it's easily reachable even for somebody with a small hand , yeah ? 
UNKNOWN Yes , yes . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Yes the buttons are all raised , right ? 
UNKNOWN The buttons are all raised and if you hold it in the centre of your hand you can even reach it over here so you don't have to turn it around , turn it upside down , move it up , up and down , I really like that . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN Are raised , mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Or have two hands to operate it , yeah . 
UNKNOWN You really did a good job on that , my little designers . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um and um I like the idea that the on-off button is in a really prominent place . 
UNKNOWN That's that's a really good good thing . 
UNKNOWN Yes , and it sort of sticks up so that you really you don't have to g first go like oh yeah here it's on and yeah , mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's great . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Abs okay . 
UNKNOWN The colour's very attractive . 
UNKNOWN Um the um these buttons uh around here are the mute and these mm-hmm On both sides they're mute ? 
UNKNOWN No , these the front buttons which are here , are the mute buttons . 
UNKNOWN Yes , yes . 
UNKNOWN So you can push either one ? 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So if you're left-handed or right-handed it doesn't matter . 
UNKNOWN And this brings the menu up on the screen ? 
UNKNOWN Pardon me ? 
UNKNOWN This brings the menu up on the screen and the orange ones are Okay . 
UNKNOWN This is the menu yes , yes . 
UNKNOWN A the the these these two are th to increase or decrease the volumes , and these two are to uh scroll the programme channels . 
UNKNOWN F f okay . 
UNKNOWN Right , very good . 
UNKNOWN Scroll up or scroll down the channels . 
UNKNOWN Uh it looks mm looks like something I can sell . 
UNKNOWN Okay and now I'm supposed to yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well , I have one question uh will there be anything written on the buttons , like that people know , or they have to learn that from a piece of paperwhich button does what ? 
UNKNOWN Yes , it will have uh these buttons will have the numbers and all the rest of the buttons will have symbols . 
UNKNOWN Ah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , definitely . 
UNKNOWN Will have symbols so that that that the user really knows you know and doesn't have to first learn it Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yes , which can be easily recognised . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Good point because we need the symbols 'cause we're going into an international market we can't have anything that's language dependent . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN Yeah of course , and also Hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But anyway it would ha i i i it has to have some kind of of symbols , text or something so that people kn That's right . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN Yeah we can Text . 
UNKNOWN Symbols on it . 
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm , mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN Text that we can have on the case itself , we can it will be printed on the case and symbols as well as the buttons . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Okay , yeah just wanted make sure of that mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN And and one more feature is we we have a holder for this remote which is an oyster shape . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Mm , 'kay , mm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN A shell shape . 
UNKNOWN For the snail , yeah , mm-hmm , we have the snail shell . 
UNKNOWN Right , mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Yes , yes . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So it is yeah , yeah shell . 
UNKNOWN Yes , snail shell . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN He goes right back into his shell . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Well you know I think we could do something really funny with this too because the snail is known to be slow and we could have some sort of little comic effect on our marketing about how this is a rapid snail or something like that you know that would , that would really work . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Y Yes Yes . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , of course , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Now what , what are our special features for the marketing ? 
UNKNOWN So I think voice recognition is our big selling point 'cause nobody else seems to have that in in this price range . 
UNKNOWN That's really the voice recognition that's really unusual And then , and then the other thing would basically be sh shape or practicality of use . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Yep uh well I think that everybody's gonna say their remote control is practical . 
UNKNOWN You know . 
UNKNOWN I think we have to , we have to dwell on on on the appearance . 
UNKNOWN Colours . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN We're really gonna have the be the cutest remote control on the block . 
UNKNOWN Cutest . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So I think we have to play with the image , play with the snail image um play with the visual and then the voice recognition . 
UNKNOWN I think those are the two things to push . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN The look and the voice recognition . 
UNKNOWN They're gonna be our two selling points . 
UNKNOWN Okay , now uh having said that No , now this was our evaluation criteria which we uh just have done . 
UNKNOWN I'm supposed to make a little presentation, aren't I ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Now we're gonna talk about financing . 
UNKNOWN Ah , but in my instructions I think it said I was supposed to go to the board and do something . 
UNKNOWN No ? 
UNKNOWN Well , there is a production evaluation . 
UNKNOWN Is that you ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's me . 
UNKNOWN But that's after the financing . 
CONFIRMATION Oh , okay . 
UNKNOWN See ? 
UNKNOWN Sorry , sorry . 
UNKNOWN Fi see ? 
UNKNOWN Mm-mm . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Okay , we had looks and voice recognition . 
UNKNOWN Okay now on the financing we bring up the mm there it is . 
UNKNOWN Okay uh energy source we say that's battery , right ? 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN That's right . 
UNKNOWN Okay , now . 
UNKNOWN So we I guess we use one . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN What ? 
UNKNOWN T cell or chartyou are trying to change is protected . 
UNKNOWN Well , that's nice . 
UNKNOWN She told me I could just ch change it here and then it would It doesn't work . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Can you just fill it in in the yellow boxes ? 
UNKNOWN Or Well . 
CONFIRMATION Oh , okay yeah , okay , let's see . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay , one , okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN Oh go away . 
UNKNOWN Um kinetic source so that's in the energy source that's all we need . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Uh electronics , simple chip on print? 
UNKNOWN Is that's what we're using ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN One of those ? 
UNKNOWN Come on . 
UNKNOWN Okay , one . 
UNKNOWN Uh regular chip on print. 
NEGATION No . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN That's all we need , the one case , uncurved flat , single curved , double curved . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN This is a Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Single curve ? 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN I guess it's double curved . 
UNKNOWN Double curved ? 
UNKNOWN One of those ? 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Case materi s supplements . 
UNKNOWN Plastic we said , right ? 
UNKNOWN Plastic . 
UNKNOWN Uh wood , rubber ? 
UNKNOWN Rubber , because we're gonna have the soft buttons . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh but , yes but That's just for the case material , so special colours though , we having that , right ? 
UNKNOWN I think uh that is uh f for rubbers that is uh yeah case material . 
UNKNOWN Is this for the case ? 
UNKNOWN Oh okay , the mm-hmm , mm' kay . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN And then we have to interface push buttons . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Scroll wheel , no . 
UNKNOWN Integrated scroll wheel , L_C_ display ? 
UNKNOWN No , 'cause we didn't put the clock in it after all , right ? 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN Button . 
NEGATION No . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Uh , button supplement special colour ? 
UNKNOWN Speci Yes Yes d we do have special form . 
UNKNOWN Special form ? 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN And special material , rubber , wood , yes . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Total seven point six whatever that means . 
UNKNOWN Uh , I think that's the price . 
UNKNOWN That's the price . 
UNKNOWN One two three four five six seven eight nine Nine points , okay , yes . 
UNKNOWN Maybe it is it just n Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Mm ? 
UNKNOWN Eight , eight point two . 
UNKNOWN That's hmm ? 
UNKNOWN Eight point two , right ? 
UNKNOWN So , we looks like we are well within budget . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN I guess I should save this I suppose , huh ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Oops . 
UNKNOWN Uh-huh huh huh . 
UNKNOWN On the desktop . 
UNKNOWN I just tried that . 
UNKNOWN My documents, computer . 
UNKNOWN AMI . 
UNKNOWN My compu Ah oh here it is , yes . 
UNKNOWN AMI should for Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay , fine . 
UNKNOWN Save . 
UNKNOWN Okay good , so that's the good news . 
UNKNOWN We gonna be popular . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN So that uh I think financing was pretty simple . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Now we would like to have a presentationby the marketing expert on production evaluation . 
UNKNOWN Okay , I'll take my filedown so you can bring it up . 
UNKNOWN 'Kay should be able to get it now . 
UNKNOWN 'Kay , why don't you move just to the next slideright away . 
UNKNOWN You wanna go to the next slide? 
UNKNOWN Yeah right away . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Okay , well uh obviously my method for uh s m the marketing of this thing is first to ask the big question , will it sell ? 
UNKNOWN And I think we should show this prototype to people from various age and socio-economic groups and see about any fine tuning that maybe little things we haven't thought of . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN We can't accept every suggestion of course , but maybe we just need to get a few . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And show the the prototype to consumer research groups , we don't s want somebody to suddenly come to us and tell us that this button is toxic and you know some child will swallow it and then we won't sell any . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN So we have to get some input from those people . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN And then after that we just have to go with our best intuition and you know we like it , we think it's good , we're gonna get behind it and sell it . 
UNKNOWN Um , next slideplease . 
UNKNOWN Okay , now the things that I was thinking and th my wish list has really been realised in this prototype . 
UNKNOWN I wanted the shape to be biomorphic , I didn't want anything with angles and all square , I wanted it to be comfy and roundy so we we've got that . 
UNKNOWN The size is small , the colour's bright and warm which is what we wanted . 
UNKNOWN We wanted the feel to be as soft as possible , we'll have the soft buttons and the way this is shaped , even though it's gonna be hard plastic , it feels good in your hand so that's nice . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN And functionality I put last on my list because people aren't going to use it before they buy it . 
UNKNOWN So paradoxically the other features , in other words , the look , the feel um and the shape , that's what people are gonna get in the store . 
UNKNOWN Fee selling . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN They don't have a television in the store , they can't play with it . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN Um so they'll be our main selling points . 
UNKNOWN So um th those have been fulfilled by your prototype and go ahead to the next slideplease . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so um the shape um I think is a a one . 
UNKNOWN That's really , really excellent shape . 
UNKNOWN The size is small um and th these points are in the importance for the , for the marketing , these aren't i in how I feel . 
UNKNOWN I think that it's I think that it's plenty small enough to sell but I think we're sort of right the scale is one to seven . 
UNKNOWN I think we're sort of right in the middle as far as c other competitors . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN And our colour I think is great . 
UNKNOWN The colours are bright and warm and we really do great job there . 
UNKNOWN And given um the constraints that we had I think we got it as soft as possible . 
UNKNOWN And then functionality um I think you did a really good job on functionality , obviously we could have ad added different functions but then we'd disturb something else so I would say that we got to a five out of seven on on functionality . 
UNKNOWN So I think that basically we've got a great product and we can get off and running with it . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um I just realised one thing . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN In the financing there was no room for our voice recogniser . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN Ah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And uh I don't know how we can evaluate that or how we can include that , too . 
UNKNOWN Well , um we had what , eight eight euros twenty as our cost ? 
UNKNOWN Eight , eight twenty , yes . 
UNKNOWN Eight twenty so We have um four euros , yeah Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And so we've got we've still got four euros to go to spend . 
UNKNOWN I mean maximum we have another four point three euros I mean four thirty . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Well um that's Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN But I mean we have no way of presenting that to management as you know as a f finished , as a finished product and saying okay with the voice recogniser that costs so much . 
UNKNOWN So um we just have to beware of that . 
UNKNOWN I mean and know whether the four thirty will really cover that . 
UNKNOWN Well as we know in today's technic technological world you can do just about anything at any price , the the the problem is quality . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So we're just gonna have to settle for whatever quality that will buy us . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yes , yes . 
UNKNOWN And um it may not be the greatest quality but it may sell anyway . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , still . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN As we've seen with so many of these kinds of products . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I'm sorry to interrupt then but I just uh recog I just remembered that there was no that that was not um included uh that there was no room for any special features , okay ? 
UNKNOWN Included , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Hmm , hmm Yeah , even my yeah , shape is one . 
UNKNOWN Yeah mm . 
UNKNOWN So to beware of that . 
UNKNOWN You wanna go to this next slide, marketing expert ? 
UNKNOWN Uh , well I isn't this my last slide? 
CONFUSION Maybe . 
UNKNOWN I dunno . 
UNKNOWN Go ahead . 
UNKNOWN Yes it is . 
UNKNOWN I think that was my last slide, yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Mm okay . 
UNKNOWN And I'm supposed to present this scale on the whiteboard . 
UNKNOWN Um and we're supposed to talk about those things as a team now , so if you put my last slideback up there . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN I'm sorry I've um forgot to do that , um . 
UNKNOWN Why ? 
UNKNOWN Wh why you need that up ? 
UNKNOWN Hmm ? 
UNKNOWN Well because I can't remember what I put on there . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Now I'm supposed to see how long my leash is here . 
UNKNOWN I think you can make it there . 
UNKNOWN Mm 'kay . 
UNKNOWN You ready . 
UNKNOWN So now we're all supposed to say what we think . 
UNKNOWN Um okay so on shape I gave it a one . 
UNKNOWN Wait what would you ra uh one being good and seven being the worst . 
UNKNOWN Worse , okay . 
UNKNOWN Um what do you think the shape is ? 
UNKNOWN One . 
UNKNOWN One , okay , and Be Betsy ? 
UNKNOWN Yes I think uh shape is one . 
UNKNOWN Okay , uh-huh one , okay . 
UNKNOWN And how about on size ? 
UNKNOWN On size I gave it a four , yeah , I feel it's just average . 
UNKNOWN You you gave it a four . 
UNKNOWN Um , I dunno . 
UNKNOWN I think I would give it at least a two . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN One . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , even I think it is one . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN It's quite small . 
UNKNOWN Okay you're the designer , of course you wanna give it a one . 
UNKNOWN Um and then how about how we doing on colour ? 
UNKNOWN Colour uh I One . 
UNKNOWN Colour , I gave it a one . 
UNKNOWN I really like all those nice bright , warm colours . 
UNKNOWN I I like the colours . 
UNKNOWN One . 
UNKNOWN One . 
UNKNOWN One . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , one . 
UNKNOWN One , one , one , okay . 
UNKNOWN And how about the feel ? 
UNKNOWN Taking into um consideration texture and comfort in the hand . 
UNKNOWN Uh , I think I would give it a two . 
UNKNOWN Okay , I gave it a three , two , yeah ? 
UNKNOWN I'll give three . 
UNKNOWN Three . 
UNKNOWN Uh maybe two , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Two , okay . 
UNKNOWN And the next is functionality where I I admit I was a little hard on our team here , but Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well it's also you can't really try it out uh the other things you have have more is are more tangible so from that point of view but um I'll give it a three . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Two . 
UNKNOWN Two , okay . 
UNKNOWN Uh three , mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Three ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Well , um . 
UNKNOWN It looks like we've got got ourselves a pretty good product . 
UNKNOWN Um the functionality's the only place where maybe we have to think about m m maybe , heaven forbid , having another meeting . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But um otherwise I think we're we're ready to go to go with this product . 
UNKNOWN Anybody else have any other comments or any other things that we feel we should evaluate ? 
CONFUSION Uh . 
UNKNOWN Here is what we looking at uh satisfaction on for example room for creativity . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Is there more room for creativity or are we absolutely happy ? 
UNKNOWN Maybe we can yeah , include some more buttons and uh um yeah features . 
UNKNOWN We can always improve , yes . 
UNKNOWN Yes , features . 
UNKNOWN We can make the buttons few buttons smaller . 
UNKNOWN Uh I think they are quite big , so I think I I mean we can just have small buttons and more buttons in that case . 
UNKNOWN If we want to have more features than that . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Well then again if we're gonna um do the speech recognition thing we're gon there gonna be some buttons that are gonna have to be added for that for the recording of the the speech . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , definitely . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN Voices . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So that that's where we're gonna have to do maybe we can eliminate one of the mute buttons , instead of having two mute buttons . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , definitely , yeah , two mu mute buttons . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN And um then maybe we can do something with the um the volume control . 
UNKNOWN Maybe we can put that all on one button . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um and a couple of other th maybe comp uh consolidate some of the usage an and see what we can do with that . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Y um al always bearing in mind that right now we are of course well within the budget and that we still you know we probably can't , with this particular item , we probably can't just uh add a whole lot of more things . 
UNKNOWN And maybe Yes . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN Uh um we need uh you know we need to leave space money-wise for the voice recogniser . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFUSION Um . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So th the question really is how do we feel with the project process ? 
UNKNOWN Uh , um are we happy with the creativity that has passed here or we're not happy with the new product we created or that was created ? 
UNKNOWN Uh I think personally I think uh I'm pretty happy . 
UNKNOWN I'm pretty happy with it too , yeah um , it's something I think I can market . 
UNKNOWN Even I'm happy . 
UNKNOWN Um an and then the next question is are we happy with the leadership of this project ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh And I think team work I think was very very good , I think we really yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think you've done a good job , Miss leader . 
UNKNOWN Yes , yes you've done a good job . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah , definitely . 
UNKNOWN Yeah I d I do too I think we worked well together as a team , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN And uh I think we are we happy with the means we used ? 
UNKNOWN We used whiteboard , we didn't use digital p well digital pens I guess are these things . 
UNKNOWN Yeah maybe we could've used the whiteboard a little bit more , yeah , we didn't use that enough . 
UNKNOWN Whiteboard more , yes , yes . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , probably . 
UNKNOWN Yes , we could . 
UNKNOWN Uh , it's maybe not in the best position in the room um you know like sometimes it's positioned so that it's much better visible for everybody and I think from that point of view we sort of ignored it a little bit . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN And we used the slidebecause it was better positioned . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN Yes , I think so , I think absolutely , and fortunately we all had slidespresentationwhich made it a little easier . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN Mm I think that's true mm-hmm . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um did we new did we find new ideas ? 
UNKNOWN I think we did . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , many . 
UNKNOWN I think we were we were very good , yeah , mm . 
UNKNOWN I think we we did , uh in more than one respect and uh so I think we did very well here . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Are the costs within budget ? 
UNKNOWN Yes , yes . 
UNKNOWN Uh is the project evaluated ? 
UNKNOWN Yes , yes . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um then celebration . 
UNKNOWN Celebration . 
UNKNOWN Cel celebration yes , yes . 
UNKNOWN Ah . 
UNKNOWN Today we have apple juice and after we sell m million of 'em we have champagne . 
UNKNOWN So I I thank you all very much . 
UNKNOWN Um , I think this was very good and um I think we did come up with a new product that's uh feasible . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Feasible from the production point of view and feasible from a marketing point of view . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So , thank you .

CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
THANKS Thank you . 
THANKS Thank you very much .

UNKNOWN Bart . 
GREETING Hello . 
GREETING Hello . 
UNKNOWN Bart . 
UNKNOWN Welcome . 
THANKS Thank you . 
UNKNOWN Uh let's see . 
UNKNOWN Uh let's start off um with a little presentation. 
UNKNOWN Uh Now first I'll tell you a little bit about the setting . 
UNKNOWN You can see there are a few cameras here . 
UNKNOWN They'll record uh our actions and you'll have wires and microphones that will record your voice . 
UNKNOWN Uh there are also some microphones there but th um you don't have to pay a lot of attention on those , because it will uh disappear when you don't attend to it . 
UNKNOWN So is there a project documentsfolder ? 
UNKNOWN There are some notesin it already I see , some documents. 
UNKNOWN Uh I'll start with the presentationkick off . 
UNKNOWN Is being modified by the administrator . 
UNKNOWN Uh okay . 
UNKNOWN Hmm , that's interesting . 
UNKNOWN Let's do it read only . 
UNKNOWN Well I don't know if you've noticed , but uh we're working for Real Reaction . 
UNKNOWN Uh it's a company in uh electronics . 
UNKNOWN We put fashion in electronics , uh we make it work , uh we put a lot of effort in design and in the product itself . 
UNKNOWN I'm Bart the project manager so I'll direct you through the project . 
UNKNOWN This is our agenda. 
UNKNOWN Uh we have our opening acquaintance , tool training , project plan description closing . 
UNKNOWN Uh maybe I can sit down , then I can take some notesor Let's see . 
UNKNOWN Maybe you can take the minutesonce in a while . 
CONFIRMATION Sure . 
UNKNOWN I dunno it's not a lot of work , but just uh if you hear something uh you can write down , just write it down . 
UNKNOWN Uh as you can see uh it's the opening , aquaintance tool training . 
UNKNOWN Aquaintance is a point we've done a bit . 
UNKNOWN Um have you all seen the corporate website already ? 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN Visit it . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Have you seen any flaws in it ? 
UNKNOWN I think I found one . 
UNKNOWN No ? 
UNKNOWN Hmm ? 
UNKNOWN Can't say I paid much attention to it , but Oh yeah . 
UNKNOWN I can see if it works this way . 
UNKNOWN No , it doesn't work here . 
UNKNOWN Okay no problem . 
UNKNOWN But um on the corporate information side there's a th uh there was Real Remote instead of Real Reaction . 
UNKNOWN Real Remote is not really the company we're we are , but it's just a little fault . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um okay , what are we going to do ? 
UNKNOWN Uh our project aim is as you can see a new remote control . 
UNKNOWN It has to be original , trendy , and user friendly . 
UNKNOWN So these are uh the points why uh we also hired you . 
UNKNOWN We've got the Marketing Expert for uh the trendy and user friendly look . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN And Industrial Designer uh there's also user friendly and a bit original . 
UNKNOWN And we've got our User Interface Designer . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN He's also uh That's about the new remote control . 
UNKNOWN Uh project method um is uh there are three phases we are going through . 
UNKNOWN First is functional des uh design , individual work , meetings . 
UNKNOWN After the functional design , then the conceptual design and the detailed design . 
UNKNOWN I had some role indications on here . 
UNKNOWN But I think you know it already by yourself . 
UNKNOWN The Industrial Designer is going to work on the working design , uh components design and a bit of the look and feel design . 
UNKNOWN Uh the User Interface Designer is going to do the technical function design , user interface concept and user interface design . 
UNKNOWN And the marketing expert is doing a little bit of user requirement specification , trend watching and project uh product ev evaluation . 
UNKNOWN So that's a bit what you're going to do . 
UNKNOWN But that will be all worked out in uh other meetings . 
UNKNOWN Then we've got our first tool training . 
UNKNOWN We are going to work with a lot of high-tech tools here , so it's ab it's handy if we have a little bit of training first . 
UNKNOWN As you can see we've got the smart boards here and here in the white board . 
UNKNOWN Um in the white board here there's a little tool bar on this side . 
UNKNOWN Here are some functions . 
UNKNOWN You can save . 
UNKNOWN N uh these functions we don't have anything to do with , only undo , you can undo a little uh piece of drawing. 
UNKNOWN A blank new documentfor each person . 
UNKNOWN Uh select a pen , eraser . 
UNKNOWN Capture we don't have to do anything with . 
UNKNOWN Uh then we've got our pen . 
UNKNOWN This pen . 
UNKNOWN It's really funny because you can drawwith it on this pageum in the think it is form of . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN You can also select the current colour and the line width . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN But then first you have to select the pen function . 
UNKNOWN But we're going to work with it in a minute. 
UNKNOWN So okay . 
UNKNOWN Uh that's very simple and it's easy to uh drawyour findings and drawings on there . 
UNKNOWN Uh then a short thing about documents. 
UNKNOWN We've got our shared folder , uh project project what was it ? 
UNKNOWN Project documentsI think . 
UNKNOWN But all you will found that already because there are a lot of documentsin it already , so it will be okay . 
UNKNOWN And these are available on the smart boards as well , so if you have a documentyou wanna show , just open it from the folder . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Here is a simple tool bar . 
UNKNOWN It's what I just said , it's save , print, move back or forward one page. 
UNKNOWN You can switch between the different drawings . 
UNKNOWN And then we're going to try out the white board . 
UNKNOWN So as you can see we g all going to drawa animal . 
UNKNOWN Just to uh uh just to get a bit familiar with it . 
UNKNOWN Mouse wasn't running away . 
UNKNOWN That was interesting . 
UNKNOWN Is everybody is anybody playing with the mouse ? 
NEGATION No . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Innocent . 
UNKNOWN We're going to uh drawanimal . 
UNKNOWN And uh just sum up a few of its favourite characteristics . 
UNKNOWN Um the only thing we have to uh look after is that we use different colours , and different line width . 
UNKNOWN Uh there's I can start from now . 
UNKNOWN I will . 
UNKNOWN You can use this pen by holding it like a like a little child . 
UNKNOWN Because if you hold it like this , the sensors will get blocked and then the drawingwon't get good . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN Another thing is you have to be uh a bit slow . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause if you're going to drawlike really fast then um the pen won't hold up . 
UNKNOWN So we choose form of current colour uh I think grey is appropriate . 
UNKNOWN Then the line width . 
UNKNOWN I think seven will be nice . 
UNKNOWN Now you'll see my drawingcapabilities . 
UNKNOWN These are not very much , but uh Uh , see you have to do it real slow . 
UNKNOWN Oh Ah I was trying to drawa dolphin , but I think his nose has to be a little bit But it's close . 
CONFIRMATION Sure . 
UNKNOWN I'm thinking about a swordfish . 
UNKNOWN So what yeah it's this is bit of the swordfish . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , he hasn't got an eye . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Woah . 
UNKNOWN Now we've got another function . 
UNKNOWN We've got the eraser . 
UNKNOWN And then you can undo this easily . 
UNKNOWN . 
UNKNOWN Meat . 
UNKNOWN Ah it's okay . 
UNKNOWN And I've got to write down a few of its characteristics . 
UNKNOWN Uh is They've got no text tool , no . 
CONFUSION Uh . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN This is typically a undo action , I think . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Pen . 
UNKNOWN Maybe you have to hold it a bit upside-down . 
UNKNOWN I think that's it because if you wan ar are going to do it like this then it will be a stripe . 
UNKNOWN But I don't know , I'm just trying . 
UNKNOWN This is not my work , okay . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Maybe you have to use Oh . 
CONFUSION Uh . 
UNKNOWN I think it's a it wants to drawa another animal ? 
UNKNOWN I don't know . 
UNKNOWN It lives for the fun . 
UNKNOWN So It's my characteristic uh characteristic about the dolphin . 
UNKNOWN It lives for the fun . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So now I'm gonna hand over the pen on the new blank sheetto you . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Go ahead . 
THANKS Thank you . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Gonna use a different line width . 
UNKNOWN And I'm gonna drawin black . 
UNKNOWN There . 
UNKNOWN 'Kay , I'm not much of an artist , but here we go . 
UNKNOWN Maybe it's easier to drawthe smaller line width , I think . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Because this is going a lot better than uh I did . 
UNKNOWN A sheep . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN This is my um Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Sheep . 
UNKNOWN It's nice . 
UNKNOWN With of course little blue dot they always get sprayed on their butts . 
CONFUSION Uh . 
UNKNOWN It's a real dead sheep , yeah . 
UNKNOWN There . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN For recognition , yeah , I see . 
UNKNOWN Um maybe you can also write your name somewhere . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN On just a Yeah . 
UNKNOWN They are Come on . 
UNKNOWN You have to go really slow when you're writing . 
UNKNOWN They're brilliant animal animals . 
UNKNOWN And that's just a little me thingy . 
UNKNOWN So . 
UNKNOWN Guess I'll pass the pen to our User Interface Designer . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Nice . 
UNKNOWN Um I'm just gonna drawits uh head , but mm Let's see . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFUSION Uh . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Interesting . 
UNKNOWN Sweet . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN You know what that is ? 
UNKNOWN Or who ? 
UNKNOWN A rabbit ? 
UNKNOWN Garfield . 
UNKNOWN Ah okay , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Garfield . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Just a Mm . 
UNKNOWN Guess . 
UNKNOWN So uh Yeah . 
UNKNOWN That's enough . 
UNKNOWN Um , you say a blank , or Okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , just a blank sheet. 
UNKNOWN Well I was gonna drawa cat too , so . 
UNKNOWN I'll just try something else . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN Something different than Garfield . 
UNKNOWN Mine is a bit more skinny . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , it's pretty skinny cat . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But uh Well , it's supposed to be a cat . 
UNKNOWN And the most interesting tail . 
UNKNOWN Is your cat , or did you find him on the street ? 
UNKNOWN I like cats because uh they are uh independent . 
UNKNOWN Ah . 
UNKNOWN The pen . 
UNKNOWN So . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN That's pretty clear . 
UNKNOWN So everybody knows how to work with the white board now ? 
UNKNOWN So if you have any ideas or if you wanna drawanything on the white board , just ask and go ahead . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN The pen . 
UNKNOWN It's pretty uh easy . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN S haunted white board . 
UNKNOWN We're being haunted . 
UNKNOWN So we've got the tool uh introduction . 
UNKNOWN We move along to the project finance . 
UNKNOWN Um as you can see , we um for our remote control , a selling price is uh twenty five Euros . 
UNKNOWN Our selling price . 
UNKNOWN Uh our profit aim is fifty million Euros . 
UNKNOWN Uh that's the least we have to get from our remote controls , so we have to work together to reach our aims . 
UNKNOWN Uh we can do it international , so we have to focus on different kind of users , different kind of cultures , and different kind of trends as well . 
UNKNOWN Um but that's all in the later stadium . 
UNKNOWN Our production cost um can be maximal twelve and a half Euros , so that's also a point we have to keep in mind , that we won't make remote controls with small televisions inside , and stuff like that . 
UNKNOWN It won't work . 
UNKNOWN So just try to remember these points . 
UNKNOWN Selling price twenty five , profit aims fifty million um , but more important is the int international market we're trying to focus on . 
UNKNOWN And production cost uh maximal twelve and a half Euros . 
UNKNOWN So that's leads us to our little discussion . 
UNKNOWN We've got about five or ten minutes left for discussion . 
UNKNOWN So I'm gonna sit down , I think . 
UNKNOWN It's easier . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , you got a message . 
UNKNOWN I've got a message . 
UNKNOWN Five minutes . 
UNKNOWN Five minutes , okay . 
UNKNOWN Okay , that's uh good timing . 
UNKNOWN So just on a side note , why is it my laptop is only giving me a black screen ? 
UNKNOWN Mm ? 
UNKNOWN Uh maybe you have to say the magic word . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Does it do anything ? 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN Maybe you have to just clap it down ? 
UNKNOWN Mm back up again . 
UNKNOWN No slideshow . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN It's off now . 
UNKNOWN It's off . 
UNKNOWN Now you have to put it back o Oh yeah . 
UNKNOWN You'll be okay , I think . 
UNKNOWN Well , it was on , but Ah , there we are . 
UNKNOWN Well it's those laptops . 
UNKNOWN Nice . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN But so mm does everybody has um experiences with uh remote controls , and I mean not the ordinary mote controls , but also a little bit different ones ? 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Like you can use for other ? 
UNKNOWN Oh really ? 
UNKNOWN No ? 
UNKNOWN Huh . 
UNKNOWN You ? 
UNKNOWN Well , we have a kind of broad T_V_ at home , and a D_V_D_ player , so we got like a lot of remote controls , one for the T_V_ , one for the video recorder , one for the D_V_D_ player . 
UNKNOWN No , me neither . 
UNKNOWN It's a Sure . 
UNKNOWN Ah yeah . 
UNKNOWN And I think it's it would be best to just make one remote control that can operate them all . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN Yeah I've I've got one at home . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And you can uh program I think eight different devices in it , and you can use it for your television , anything else . 
CONFIRMATION Okay , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And it also operates on infra-red , so you have to got the little device inside your room , and then you can operate it from the third or th or second floor . 
CONFIRMATION Okay , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Oh really . 
UNKNOWN So that's pretty handy when you have a video recorder or D_V_D_ player downstairs and you've got a link to your T_V_ on the second floor . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
SURPRISE Oh .
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So that's a pretty handy um thing . 
UNKNOWN Um but only the I think that if you can put different kind of devices in one remote control , it makes it a lot easier as well . 
UNKNOWN It's uh That's good to remember . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN So I think you can take minutesagain . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's nice , I think . 
UNKNOWN Since it's your job . 
UNKNOWN So we've we want different functions uh and we can maybe see if we can do something with the infra-red . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But I don't know if that will exceed the production costs . 
UNKNOWN So that uh that's something we have to find out , I think . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But that would be really good if we could do that . 
UNKNOWN And other functions for a remote control ? 
UNKNOWN Maybe we can make it uh uh Shock proof . 
CONFUSION Um . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Think it has to be shock proof 'cause my remote control tends to fall a lot . 
UNKNOWN Sure , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Waterproof , or uh Uh , you never no know uh , I w I mean uh 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN So Yeah , one other little thing . 
CONFIRMATION Sure . 
UNKNOWN Waterproof . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So these are our um a few things we can think of . 
UNKNOWN Um I will put the minutesfrom this meeting uh in our project folder . 
UNKNOWN Thought it might be handy to put a battery status display on it . 
UNKNOWN So you can see how much is left in the battery . 
UNKNOWN That's a battery stays . 
CONFIRMATION Okay , yeah . 
UNKNOWN But they'll also really drag up the production costs , so think we'll have to see about that too . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFUSION Uh . 
UNKNOWN But maybe just a little LED , I don't know . 
UNKNOWN That's an idea as well . 
UNKNOWN Other ideas ? 
UNKNOWN Quick ideas . 
UNKNOWN Nope . 
UNKNOWN They were all mentioned , so Okay . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Any questions about this uh presentation? 
UNKNOWN Kick off presentation. 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Nope , don't think so . 
UNKNOWN No ? 
UNKNOWN Okay , then I'll put the minutesfrom this meeting in the project folder , and then we can all work . 
UNKNOWN Finish meeting now . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN And we can all work uh on our own projects . 
UNKNOWN Aye sir . 
UNKNOWN Okay then I'll meet you in about a half an hour , I think . 
UNKNOWN Half an hour . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So good luck . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Everybody found his place again ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah ? 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN That's nice . 
UNKNOWN Okay so this is our second meeting . 
UNKNOWN And uh still failing ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh now we're going um into the functional design . 
UNKNOWN Um important thing of this phase is that we're going to uh try to get an agreement about the user requirements , technical function design , and the working design . 
UNKNOWN So that we can move onto the second uh phase . 
UNKNOWN But first this phase . 
UNKNOWN Um first an announcement . 
UNKNOWN There's a little adaptation in the air conditioning system . 
UNKNOWN So There's our ghost mouse again . 
UNKNOWN That that means that you can have a little trouble with , little trouble with the air conditioning , that's because of this uh It's in wing C_ and E_ . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So it should be over in a in a while , couple of days . 
UNKNOWN But it's going to be cold anyway , so I don't think you're gonna need it . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN Then our agenda. 
UNKNOWN Now first the opening . 
UNKNOWN Uh this time I will take the minutes. 
UNKNOWN Uh you're going to have a presentation. 
UNKNOWN All of you . 
UNKNOWN Um and we've got forty minutes for the whole uh prese for the whole uh presentations. 
UNKNOWN So uh I suggest we take about seven minutes per presentation, and then we can have a little discussion about the new project requirements uh which have been sent to me . 
UNKNOWN And then the decision on the control functions uh which we wanna include and those which we don't wanna include . 
UNKNOWN So we've got forty minutes for all of it . 
UNKNOWN So I suggest um let's start with the first presentation. 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN Um who wants to be first ? 
UNKNOWN Think I'll go first . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So Just maybe it's easier if you um Yeah I think you will tell your presentationas well . 
UNKNOWN Just which function you have and what you're gonna talk about . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN My name is Freek Van Ponnen . 
UNKNOWN I'm the Market Expert . 
UNKNOWN But you already knew that . 
UNKNOWN Um I've done some research . 
UNKNOWN We have we uh have been doing research in a usability lab where we observed um users operating remote controls . 
UNKNOWN Uh we let them fill out a questionnaire . 
UNKNOWN We had one hundred of these uh test subjects . 
UNKNOWN Uh in addition we did some market research . 
UNKNOWN Uh see what the market consists of . 
UNKNOWN What ages are involved . 
UNKNOWN Well these are three quite astonishing results , I thought . 
UNKNOWN Um remotes are being considered ugly . 
UNKNOWN F uh seventy five percent of the um people questioned uh indicated that they thought their remote were was ugly . 
UNKNOWN Um and an additional eighty percent indicated that they would spend more money on a fancy-looking remote control . 
UNKNOWN So Um in addition remotes were not very functional . 
UNKNOWN Fifty percent of the people indicated they only loo used about ten percent of the buttons on a remote control . 
UNKNOWN And fifty percent of the people indicated that their remote tended to get lost in their room . 
UNKNOWN So some things . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Then we did some research to the most relevant functions . 
UNKNOWN Channel selection and volume selection um both got a ten on a scale of one to ten for relevancy . 
UNKNOWN The power button got a nine . 
UNKNOWN And teletext got a six and a half . 
UNKNOWN So these are the most most uh important functions on a remote control . 
UNKNOWN Then there are some one-time use function . 
UNKNOWN That's what I like to call them . 
UNKNOWN That uh audio settings , video settings , and channel settings buttons . 
UNKNOWN Which are not really used very frequently , but are still considered to be of some importance . 
UNKNOWN Um channel selection was also indicated to be used very frequently . 
UNKNOWN One hundred and sixty eight times per hour . 
UNKNOWN Then these are the This is the market . 
UNKNOWN Um sixty percent of the market consists of users between the ages sixteen and forty f six . 
UNKNOWN Um Main characteristic of this group is that they're very critical on the remote control . 
UNKNOWN Um they like to use new f new functions . 
UNKNOWN But they also are very critical . 
UNKNOWN They won't spend their money very easily . 
UNKNOWN So Um the users of forty six to sixty five years cons The make up forty percent of the market . 
UNKNOWN They are not really very interested in features . 
UNKNOWN But they do tend to spend their money a lot easier . 
UNKNOWN Um What I think this indicates for our um design . 
UNKNOWN I think we should make a remote for the future . 
UNKNOWN And this means we would um have to focus on the age ages sixteen to forty five . 
UNKNOWN Uh this also makes up most the biggest part of the market , so that will also be where our main profit would be gettable . 
UNKNOWN Um this would mean we would have to make a fancy design . 
UNKNOWN Um The results also indicated that um about one quarter of the people questioned thought that the remote control caused R_S_ R_S_I_ . 
UNKNOWN Um this is certainly something to take into account . 
UNKNOWN And thirty four percent thought that it was hard to learn a n how to operate a new control , remote control . 
UNKNOWN So these are two factors that I think should be included in the design . 
UNKNOWN Besides of course that the remote must look very nice . 
UNKNOWN And the functionality As a lot of people indicated , they only use about ten percent of the buttons , I think we should make very few buttons . 
UNKNOWN Uh this will also be uh beneficial to the design of the remote . 
UNKNOWN Uh I think the most frequently used buttons should be emphasised . 
UNKNOWN Especially the channel selection and audio uh selection buttons . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause they're used most and so they should be robust . 
UNKNOWN They shouldn't break down easily . 
UNKNOWN Um Then as mo as a lot of people indicated that their um remote got lost in the room , it might be and I say might be because it would um certainly boost the uh production costs a lot . 
UNKNOWN But it might be a good idea to make a docking station . 
UNKNOWN And this would , could get a button in it which would send a signal to the remote which would then beep . 
UNKNOWN So you'd know where it is in the room . 
UNKNOWN And in addition to this it could um recharge the batteries in the remote if you put it in . 
UNKNOWN Then um a surprisingly great deal of people w indicated that um an L_C_D_ screen in the remote control would be preferred . 
UNKNOWN This was um mostly people in the age of sixteen to twenty five . 
UNKNOWN But up till forty five it remains feasible . 
UNKNOWN This would also greatly increase the production costs but I think these are just some small factors we could consider . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN That would be all . 
THANKS Thank you . 
UNKNOWN So anybody have um any questions until now ? 
UNKNOWN Any questions ? 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN About functional requirements ? 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN Okay that's clear . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN Now to the second . 
UNKNOWN Uh okay . 
UNKNOWN Um I've been looking at uh the user interface of it . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um f for the techno f functions uh of of it . 
UNKNOWN Um Okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah you can take your time . 
UNKNOWN We've got uh plenty of time , so Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Mm ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah you should go to the top thingy . 
SURPRISE Oh .
CONFUSION Uh . 
UNKNOWN Slideshow . 
UNKNOWN Oh yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN There it is . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think uh we uh must use the general functions uh of the uh remote control . 
UNKNOWN Uh uh I've do I've uh done a little uh research on the internet and not much information about it , Um about uh interface but uh Uh Yeah I I've been thinking about a simple manner uh to put a lot of functions uh uh in one um in one uh remote control . 
UNKNOWN Uh so uh you've got a lot of devi uh devices like uh D_V_D_ uh uh television , uh stereo . 
UNKNOWN So um But uh it must be uh user-friendly . 
UNKNOWN So um uh you c you can't put a a lot of uh functions uh in one uh Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh uh uh Yeah . 
UNKNOWN In one um remote control . 
UNKNOWN One remote . 
UNKNOWN But um Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um yeah . 
UNKNOWN Got uh many functions in one uh remote control , um but um yeah you can see , this is uh quite simple uh remote control . 
UNKNOWN Um few uh buttons but uh This uh re uh remote control got a a lot of uh buttons . 
UNKNOWN Um uh people uh don't like it , uh so um Well what uh I was uh thinking about was um uh keep the general functions uh like they are . 
UNKNOWN So uh like uh the on-off uh button . 
UNKNOWN Uh keep it uh yeah l like a red button . 
UNKNOWN Uh everybody everybody knows it so uh uh you don't have to change that . 
UNKNOWN Um My personal uh preferences um . 
UNKNOWN Use a display for uh specific uh functions of the different uh device . 
UNKNOWN So um Wh what I was th uh thinking about was um you've got um Uh this the remote control uh and uh you got here the general functions , uh like uh the on-off button uh sound uh I dunno um And um here you've got a s kind of a display . 
UNKNOWN It's a touchscreen . 
UNKNOWN So um yeah you got a general f uh f the functions of the device uh for a D_V_D_ player or uh so um the pl yeah um f for uh playing uh reverse uh . 
UNKNOWN And um you got here uh real buttons for uh selecting uh a device . 
UNKNOWN So um this button is for a D_V_D_ or So um for every um device you've got a uh a f a b a part uh display of a part buttons . 
UNKNOWN So uh you you never got uh all the buttons uh on w one device . 
UNKNOWN So uh that's uh my uh idea about it . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN Um yeah and Uh let's see . 
UNKNOWN Uh yeah . 
UNKNOWN So a touchscreen . 
UNKNOWN Uh and um th the buttons uh the real buttons uh we have to use um . 
UNKNOWN We better c um uh use uh quite uh large buttons uh for um yeah . 
UNKNOWN Everybody uh have to use it so Uh ol even even old people um young people . 
UNKNOWN So uh we must keep uh buttons uh quite s uh simple and quite large . 
UNKNOWN So uh Um Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh yeah . 
UNKNOWN That was uh my uh part of it . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So N I I don't think so . 
UNKNOWN Anybody has questions about the technical functions ? 
UNKNOWN Well I think if we are gonna use a touchscreen uh we're gonna go way above the twelve and a half Euros . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh you got uh quite a cheap uh touchscreen . 
UNKNOWN Touchscreen . 
UNKNOWN S um it's uh not uh in colour or something . 
UNKNOWN Uh it's just uh um one colo Uh yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh I seen uh w uh something on the internet uh not today but uh a few uh weeks ago . 
UNKNOWN Uh you got uh yeah quite an uh a kind of uh touchscreen um and it's uh for uh twenty uh Euros or uh less uh . 
UNKNOWN Huh . 
UNKNOWN So it's possible . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN That's nice . 
UNKNOWN Well it would certainly make a fancy design . 
UNKNOWN Uh Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But the It wouldn't be very robust . 
UNKNOWN So That is true . 
UNKNOWN It's very fragile and you can get scratches on it . 
UNKNOWN That's right . 
UNKNOWN Yeah that's true . 
UNKNOWN We would have to look into that . 
UNKNOWN Uh maybe we can first um listen to your presentation? 
UNKNOWN Uh And then we have a little discussion about the requirements and uh design . 
CONFUSION Uh . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN That's . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN I think it's going to Uh it's not too much . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Okay I've got a presentationabout the working design . 
UNKNOWN Um first about how it works . 
UNKNOWN It's really simple of course . 
UNKNOWN Everybody knows how a remote works . 
UNKNOWN The user presses a button . 
UNKNOWN The remote determines what button it is , uses the infrared to send a signal to the T_V_ . 
UNKNOWN The T_V_ switches to the frequency , or what function it is . 
UNKNOWN So we've got um the the plate . 
UNKNOWN It gots conductive disks for every button . 
UNKNOWN When the user presses a button , a signal got sent , goes to the LED and transmits tranmi transmits its to the T_V_ . 
UNKNOWN It's a very simple device , technically speaking . 
UNKNOWN So this is a schematic overview . 
UNKNOWN You've got the buttons . 
UNKNOWN The power source . 
UNKNOWN And uh when a button gets pressed , its goes to the chip . 
UNKNOWN The chip uh controls the infrared bulb and perf perhaps a normal bulb . 
UNKNOWN When you press a button you can actually see your pressed button . 
UNKNOWN Well um I think we should use default materials , simple plastics . 
UNKNOWN Keep the inner workings simple , so it's robust . 
UNKNOWN Uh I think we should focus on aesthetics , the design and the user interface , because if you're going to use high-tech materials the price is going to go sky-high . 
UNKNOWN And uh you only have to design a remote once , and if you use high-tech materials it come back in every product . 
UNKNOWN So it's , in my idea , it's uh it's gonna be smart to invest in di in design and not in uh in the product itself . 
UNKNOWN That's it . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
THANKS Thank you . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Uh Okay now I hope everybody has a little bit more insight in the functions we all have and what we are doing right now . 
UNKNOWN Um I'm the Project Manager so I'm here to mess things up and uh tell you some new uh requirements . 
UNKNOWN Um that's , we've uh got to design a um remote which is only suitable for T_V_ . 
UNKNOWN Um that's because uh it will be too complex and the time to market will be too big , if we wanna have it uh for more functions . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN So it has to be simple . 
UNKNOWN Uh another point is we have to skip the teletext , because in the world of uh upcoming internet uh we think teletext is going to be uh a thing of the past . 
UNKNOWN And uh it's a function we don't need in our remote control . 
UNKNOWN Um internet is also mentioned in a function we can use . 
UNKNOWN Uh maybe also on televisions it will be available as well . 
UNKNOWN Another one is uh the customer is uh forty plus . 
UNKNOWN Uh that's the the market we have to to to target , because we are going to develop a new product which is specially designed for the younger customers . 
UNKNOWN Um this is uh a bit pity for the Marketing uh Expert . 
UNKNOWN Because he was uh aiming on the the younger persons . 
UNKNOWN So we have to find a market which is above forty plus uh but which will suit our uh remote control , and the other way round . 
UNKNOWN And we have to be very uh attent in uh putting the corporate image uh in our product . 
UNKNOWN So it has to be visible in our design , in the way our device works . 
UNKNOWN And uh we have to be uh very clear on this point as well . 
UNKNOWN So I suggest let's have a discussion on the control functions . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So is there any discussion possible about the new product requirement ? 
UNKNOWN Uh we can see if we can find a way uh between the functions we wanna use and the market we wanna reach with our product . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Um Against the no teletext ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah 'cause you're you're saying that teletext is gonna be an old feature and it's not gonna be used anymore anyway pretty soon . 
UNKNOWN And new T_V_s will have internet access on them . 
UNKNOWN But I think if you're targeting people of forty plus , the chance that they will have a T_V_ with internet access within the next like twenty years is very slim . 
UNKNOWN In addition people indicated that teletext simply was an important feature for the remote control . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So I think it's pretty dumb to put no teletext feature on it . 
UNKNOWN I'm pretty much against it . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN Um Yeah it's it is Standard remote . 
UNKNOWN Besides that , I think the market for forty plus is like pretty small . 
UNKNOWN But I mean if I s if I see this , it's I think we're just gonna go for another pretty and not innovative remote control . 
UNKNOWN forty Yeah . 
UNKNOWN No I think we can I think we can do a lot with the design and the simple buttons which were also mentioned . 
UNKNOWN Uh if we put a lot of effort in those , we can make a remote control with uh just two or three buttons . 
UNKNOWN Or just a remote which is suitable for the market we wanna reach because it is forty percent of the market . 
UNKNOWN And um if you look in Holland at the whole generation of forty plus , fifty plus , it it's the the biggest share of the of the whole population now . 
UNKNOWN Yes but it's not the biggest part of the market . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN And besides that , they're not very critical so I mean they don't really care what the remote control is like . 
UNKNOWN They'll just pretty much take the first thing they see and which looks acceptable . 
UNKNOWN But don't you think that if we make a remote which is uh typically made for this market , that people think the people think that's the the device I've looked for although I didn't realise it . 
UNKNOWN So let's try it . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN I think that would be the case in the sixteen to forty five age category . 
UNKNOWN because they are critical and they they want to have a fancy remote control . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN People of forty plus , I mean they want it to work , but as soo as soon as it works it's okay with them . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think that if we're If we put our marketing right um we can sell this just like um I don't know if you've heard about it in the news , the the elderly mobile phone ? 
UNKNOWN So I haven't heard of it . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It's a big success . 
UNKNOWN Yeah if we if we make a remote control just l with that idea in mind , we could make tons of money , I think . 
UNKNOWN Very big success . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
CONFUSION Uh . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN We don't have to focus on on on the on the design then but on functionality . 
UNKNOWN I think so as well . 
UNKNOWN We just change our focus on the project , and I think we can uh we can sell this . 
UNKNOWN Uh I simply think um uh that the new products we are gonna make , uh spef specifically design , are designed for uh younger people , uh so maybe we can focus ourself on the elderly people . 
UNKNOWN And I think we have to um see what requirements we need for those um remote controls . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause what you told is the channel selection is important . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN Volume selection , power and teletext . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um No we we haven't voted yet , so Uh I think teletext can be uh um can be a function as well . 
UNKNOWN But obviously the board tends to disagree . 
UNKNOWN But only if uh if it won't higher the the cost , because I don't know if it will be a lot more money to implement teletext as well , but I don't think it will be a problem . 
UNKNOWN Or is teletext a Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But um deaf people need uh teletext for uh for subtitles . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , also . 
UNKNOWN So it's Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So I suggest uh Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think it'd definitely be a bad idea not to include teletext . 
UNKNOWN It's Mm . 
UNKNOWN Is anybody um really against teletext ? 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN No ? 
UNKNOWN Just that , that we just keep the teletext . 
UNKNOWN I think that's a good idea as well , especially for the subtitles . 
UNKNOWN Maybe we can make that um another point of advantage in our remote control , if we uh make a k a button ex for example for big subtitles , which is instantly on the remote control . 
UNKNOWN Yeah yeah . 
UNKNOWN For elderly people they can think , oh I wanna have subtitles , and they push the button and they get the big subtitles . 
UNKNOWN Uh that's a good idea . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um so I think teletext can v can be very useful in our advantage . 
UNKNOWN Um Functionality should be few buttons , you said . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN I think uh that's very important we have a few buttons . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So to keep it simple . 
UNKNOWN But I don't think that's really an issue any more 'cause Well might be . 
UNKNOWN If it's only for televi Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But I mean it , if it's only for T_V_ you're not gonna need a lot of buttons anyway . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN You need a one to zero button , next channel , previous channel , volume up , volume down , and some teletext buttons but I think if you if you only l Nah . 
NEGATION No . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But do you need But do you need the buttons for one to zero . 
UNKNOWN So we can s we can skip the display , so uh we don't need it . 
UNKNOWN Maybe c we can Maybe we can use uh No , maybe we can implement the scroll button ? 
UNKNOWN Uh Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Think if you're gonna include teletext you do . 
UNKNOWN I think many people like to use that . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause if you should , if you want to switch from channel one to like thirty five , you don't wanna push the next channel button thirty five times . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Or a joystick like ? 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN There are other ways too . 
UNKNOWN Just look if you look at telephones . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN The Sony telephone has a scroll button which is very useful in searching names or That's right . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN That's true but um I don't think there are many T_V_s that can switch channels that fast . 
UNKNOWN And so you would need like the T_V_ would need an a function where you can actually view all channels and scroll through it . 
UNKNOWN And I dunno if many channels would do have that . 
UNKNOWN If many T_V_s have that . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN And besides that it's um If we're gonna focus on elderly people they'll have to adapt . 
UNKNOWN They're not used to using scroll buttons . 
UNKNOWN So perhaps we should s stick to the basic layout. 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN the numbers yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah they can see how much buttons there are going to be on on the display , and if it's too much we can uh reconsider it . 
UNKNOWN But I think there won't be very much buttons . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Or there don't have to be a lot . 
UNKNOWN But I don't think I think if you're gonna make a remote control only to operate a T_V_ , you there's not much you can gain on um having as few buttons as possible . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause I think there are pretty many remote controls that can only operate a T_V_ , which already only have the minimum number of buttons . 
UNKNOWN I don't think there's much to be gained in that area . 
UNKNOWN The number of buttons ? 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think it's very important in the in the design . 
UNKNOWN You can make a very fancy design uh with putting the buttons on the right places . 
UNKNOWN And if you have less buttons you can do a lot more with To operate only the T_V_ yeah . 
UNKNOWN That is true but I think there's simply not much to gain on the competition when you when you're making a remote control only for to operate only the T_V_ . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause if you have a a remote control only to operate a T_V_ there's simply not a lot of buttons required . 
UNKNOWN There's not a lot of functions required so most existing remote controls simply don't have a lot of buttons either . 
NEGATION No . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN So . 
UNKNOWN So I think it would be very hard to actually gain on the competition here . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN So we can Yeah . 
UNKNOWN That would that would cost a a big marketing expedition which was one of the arguments to make it only for the T_V_ because we didn't have the time to market a lot . 
UNKNOWN That's right . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So you suggest we could better um focus on for example the docking station . 
UNKNOWN Uh uh like other functions . 
UNKNOWN Instead of f of less buttons . 
CONFUSION Maybe . 
UNKNOWN Well yeah I think , mean we obviously need a good way to position all the buttons and But I don't think we should spend very much time in that . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN Do you think the docking station will uh is allowed in the budget we have ? 
UNKNOWN It should be possible yes . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause it can be No . 
UNKNOWN If it's not too fancy . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN And if the remote stays rather small , it should be possible yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN Because I think that's uh That's a good advantage point as well . 
UNKNOWN If we have a fancy-looking docking station or very That's a nice requirement . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Docking station . 
UNKNOWN So we're just gonna focus on the extras ? 
UNKNOWN I think so . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah I think maybe we should do some research into what elderly people like to have in a like to have extra in a new remote control . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN That's a good point . 
UNKNOWN Um You said they easily get lost as well . 
UNKNOWN Yes well fifty percent of the people indicated that remote control tended to get lost . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So maybe we should implement the audio sign , or something . 
UNKNOWN Yeah that was what I suggested . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Like with your key-chain , if you whistle it goes uh it makes a sound . 
UNKNOWN You have it on Yeah you have it's on some phones too , which have a docking station . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Hm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And you just press a button and the phone goes ringing . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So audio signal should be possible as well . 
UNKNOWN So you know where it is . 
UNKNOWN I think it's not too expensive . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN Uh another point is the L_C_D_ screen . 
UNKNOWN Um I don't know if that will rise the cost too much , because Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Y i um I think we'll have to choose between the docking station or the screen , 'cause it's uh Well I don't think they have different television sets uh in uh every country . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN It will be too much as well . 
UNKNOWN I think since a lot of people indicated that a new remote control is hard to learn , and we're focusing on elderly people here which tend to have a hard time understanding new devices , it might be a good idea to have just a little screen on it , which would explain a button if you press it . 
UNKNOWN Which would tell you what it does . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And it wouldn't have to be touchscreen or a very expensive screen , but Just a small screen with two Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Based . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Just the L_C_D_ . 
UNKNOWN Oh just the normal screen . 
UNKNOWN That's a good idea . 
UNKNOWN So Some extra info . 
UNKNOWN Feedback . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think that's a good idea as well . 
UNKNOWN But I dunno if that would that would fit into the costs . 
UNKNOWN As the small screen . 
UNKNOWN Extra button info . 
UNKNOWN I think that should be possible as well . 
UNKNOWN Um let's see what did we say . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN More . 
UNKNOWN Should be fancy to , fancy design , easy to learn . 
UNKNOWN Few buttons , we talked about that . 
UNKNOWN Docking station , L_C_D_ . 
UNKNOWN Um general functions Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN And default materials . 
UNKNOWN I think that's a good idea as well , because um elderly people don't mind if it's a titanium cover or just a plastic one . 
UNKNOWN So that doesn't really matter . 
NEGATION No . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN So I think we nee Uh let's um specify the target group . 
UNKNOWN I think probably elderly people would be a little bit more careful with their remote controls than youngsters . 
UNKNOWN Because are we talking about elderly elderly people or people from forty to eighty . 
UNKNOWN Because I think what we're going to design now is for people above sixty , maybe . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh what do we want ? 
UNKNOWN I think I think that would be a If we should do something like that it would be a , I think it would be really good for uh for the image of the company . 
UNKNOWN If we want um a with uh for example the the telephone for elderly people , we can target the real elderly people . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And I think , I think there would be a good market for it . 
UNKNOWN So that's the Now you're talking about sixty to eighty for example . 
UNKNOWN If we're able to really bring an innovative product . 
UNKNOWN Yeah the really But I'd have to look into that a little more . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Sixty . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN And different cultures . 
UNKNOWN Are we Okay . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
NEGATION No . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause Yeah . 
UNKNOWN We've got five minutes left just now . 
UNKNOWN So 'Kay . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN Small warning . 
UNKNOWN And with uh the little screen in it , which explains the buttons . 
UNKNOWN Should Yeah . 
UNKNOWN You could I think we n it would be a lot easier to adapt it to different cultures . 
UNKNOWN In different languages , you know . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN or you have to put a language button in it , but that will be a bit unnecessary I think . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
NEGATION No . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It's better to put it on different markets with it all . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So that's the the target . 
UNKNOWN Uh then a few small things . 
UNKNOWN Uh okay . 
UNKNOWN I will put the minutesin the project uh project documentfolder . 
UNKNOWN Um what we're going to do for the next meeting is the Industrial Designer will do the components concept , User Interface Designer the user interface concept , and the trend-watching . 
UNKNOWN So just keep in mind the things we've said about the target group , uh requirements , and the trends which are uh going on . 
UNKNOWN And uh specific instructions will be sent to you by uh the personal coach . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN So um I thank you for this meeting . 
UNKNOWN And I think we have a lunch-break now . 
UNKNOWN That's good . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So that's a good thing . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Uh good afternoon . 
UNKNOWN Good afternoon . 
UNKNOWN This is our third meeting already . 
UNKNOWN I hope you enjoyed your lunch . 
UNKNOWN I did anyway . 
UNKNOWN Um let's see . 
UNKNOWN Presentationthree . 
UNKNOWN Okay this is um the second phase uh we're going to discuss today . 
UNKNOWN It's the conceptual design meeting . 
UNKNOWN And a few points of interest in this meeting um are the conceptual specification of components . 
UNKNOWN Uh conceptual specification of design . 
UNKNOWN And also trend-watching . 
UNKNOWN Um these are hopefully the points you addressed in uh your pre uh presentationsyou're going to show me in a few minutes . 
UNKNOWN Um but first I'll show you the agenda. 
UNKNOWN Uh first the opening . 
UNKNOWN Then we have three presentations. 
UNKNOWN Uh after that we have to come to a decision on remote control concepts . 
UNKNOWN How we're going to make it . 
UNKNOWN And then we're closing . 
UNKNOWN We have about forty minutes . 
UNKNOWN Uh so I suggest let's get started . 
UNKNOWN Uh did someone encounter any problems during the preparation ? 
UNKNOWN No ? 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN Everything fine ? 
UNKNOWN That's nice . 
UNKNOWN Then a little uh thing about the last meeting . 
UNKNOWN Uh these are the points um we agreed on . 
UNKNOWN The requirements and the target market . 
UNKNOWN Uh requirements are uh teletext , docking station , audio signal , small screen , with some extras that uh button information . 
UNKNOWN And we are going to use default materials . 
UNKNOWN Um does somebody have any comments on these requirements ? 
UNKNOWN Maybe ? 
UNKNOWN No ? 
UNKNOWN These are just the the things we thought of , so maybe if you figured something else or thought of something else , just let me know . 
UNKNOWN And maybe we can uh work it out . 
UNKNOWN And we're going to target uh sixty to to eighty year old customers . 
UNKNOWN So now everybody knows what we're do we're doing , um I suggest let's get started with the presentations. 
UNKNOWN So shall we keep the same uh line-up as uh last time ? 
CONFIRMATION Sure . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN I'll start off then . 
UNKNOWN Good luck . 
UNKNOWN Doh . 
UNKNOWN 'Kay I'm uh gonna inform you about the trend-watching I've done over the past few days . 
UNKNOWN Um we've done some market research . 
UNKNOWN We distributed some more enquetes , questionnaires . 
UNKNOWN And um besides that um I deployed some trend-watchers to Milan and Paris to well get all of the newest trends . 
UNKNOWN And I've consulted some additional trend-watch trend-watchers , after the original trend-watchers return , about what the the best design would be . 
UNKNOWN Um okay these are some overall findings . 
UNKNOWN Um most important thing is the fancy design . 
UNKNOWN Um the research indicated that that was by far the most important factor . 
UNKNOWN Um innovativeness was about half as important as the fancy design . 
UNKNOWN By innovativeness this means um functions which are not featured in other remote controls . 
UNKNOWN Um about half of , half as important as the innovativeness was the was easy to use . 
UNKNOWN Um for our um group , we're focusing on the people of sixty to eighty y years old , this is um , these factors are slightly more equal . 
UNKNOWN 'Kay these are some more group specific findings . 
UNKNOWN Uh the older people prefer dark colours . 
UNKNOWN Uh they like recognisable shapes , and familiar material . 
UNKNOWN And our surveys have indicated that especially wood is pretty much the material for older people . 
UNKNOWN Um this is , this image will give you a little bit of an impression about um the look-and-feel that um the remote should have . 
UNKNOWN Um this leads us to some personal preferences . 
UNKNOWN Uh the remote control and the docking station should uh blend in in the in the room . 
UNKNOWN Um so this would mean no uh eye-catching designs. 
UNKNOWN Just keep it simple and Well the docking station and small screen would be our main points of interest , because this would be the These would uh be the innovativeness in the remote control . 
UNKNOWN So this would be very important that we at least include these features . 
UNKNOWN Um well the trend-watchers I consulted advised that it b should be , the remote control and the docking station should be telephone-shaped . 
UNKNOWN So you could imagine that uh the remote control will be standing up straight in the docking station . 
UNKNOWN This is not really This is pretty much a new shape to uh older people . 
UNKNOWN So they would prefer uh a design where the remote control just lies flat in the docking station . 
UNKNOWN So it would be kinda more telephone-shaped . 
UNKNOWN Um besides that we would advise um to bring two editions , one with a wood-like colour and maybe feel , and one with a grey-black colour . 
UNKNOWN The wood-like for the more uh exclusive people . 
UNKNOWN People with more money . 
UNKNOWN Uh the grey-black colour for well people with less means . 
UNKNOWN That would be all . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
THANKS Thank you . 
UNKNOWN Any questions about the the trends ? 
UNKNOWN Any questions ? 
UNKNOWN Mayb No ? 
UNKNOWN Mm no . 
UNKNOWN Okay , we go on to the next one . 
UNKNOWN Um 'kay um yeah . 
UNKNOWN uh some uh research uh a about um designing of an interface . 
UNKNOWN Um the uh last meeting uh we had a about um uh using a f few buttons . 
UNKNOWN So uh um uh that's w what I what I want to uh uh to do in uh our design . 
UNKNOWN So um finding an attractive uh way to control uh the remote control . 
UNKNOWN Um the uh I found some uh something about uh speech uh recognition . 
UNKNOWN So maybe uh we can uh use uh that . 
UNKNOWN Um Uh and uh using a little uh display . 
UNKNOWN So um findings . 
UNKNOWN Um yeah just um we have just to focus on the primary um functions . 
UNKNOWN So uh only uh buttons uh for uh sound , um for uh on-off , um uh shifting u up uh sa uh ca channel or uh down shifting down . 
UNKNOWN Um uh let's see . 
UNKNOWN Um yeah and Uh we uh need some uh new a attractive functions uh uh which attract uh uh people for using it . 
UNKNOWN So uh it's uh like a speak uh speech uh recognition and um a special button for selecting uh subtitles . 
UNKNOWN Just uh what we uh mentioned uh last uh meeting . 
UNKNOWN Um and yeah overall um user-friendly . 
UNKNOWN So uh using uh large large buttons . 
UNKNOWN Um It's uh possible to uh uh to make um quite cheap uh system for uh speech uh recognition . 
UNKNOWN Um you can think about um uh when you lost your um remote control , you can uh call it and um it gives an um sig signal . 
UNKNOWN So uh uh yeah . 
UNKNOWN And and uh for uh shifting up a sen uh c ch channel or uh for um uh putting out uh sound or something , you can uh just give a sign uh say um sound off or A and uh yeah . 
UNKNOWN Television uh put the sound off uh put the sound off uh . 
UNKNOWN Um Let's see . 
UNKNOWN Uh yeah . 
UNKNOWN I was thinking about the special uh button for uh subtitles , um just one button to keep it uh simple . 
UNKNOWN Uh one push on the button uh you get uh uh small uh subtitles . 
UNKNOWN Um double push push um , if double click , um so uh you get uh big uh subtitles , for uh people uh um uh which c f uh who can't uh read small uh subtitles . 
UNKNOWN So uh Um Yeah and w we have to keep uh in general buttons uh so um we've got um the buttons we have to use . 
UNKNOWN The on-off , sound on-off , sound higher or lower , um the numbers , uh zero to uh uh nine . 
UNKNOWN Um the general buttons m more general b one button for shifting up and shifting down uh channel . 
UNKNOWN Um also we want to uh use a little d display uh for um for displaying the uh the functions of the buttons . 
UNKNOWN And um we can uh build in a function f which uh shows the channel or some uh which the t television is on . 
UNKNOWN So um made a little uh picture of uh it . 
UNKNOWN Um See . 
UNKNOWN Um yeah . 
UNKNOWN Just um we can put uh the on-off button uh over in this uh corner , um almost uh e all uh remote controls uh are using a on-off button on that place . 
UNKNOWN Um so uh people uh will uh recognise uh um the button . 
UNKNOWN So um D display uh of it , it's uh just a small display . 
UNKNOWN Uh um you can put it uh on top . 
UNKNOWN Um it's uh most uh uh place where people uh , most of looks at . 
UNKNOWN So uh um and a special uh button for shifting up uh and uh shifting down uh channel , um it's uh on place where um the thumb of of the So you you can uh easily uh shift up or shift down . 
UNKNOWN Um it's uh quite uh handy place . 
UNKNOWN So um and uh all the f functions for subtitle uh one button , uh for sound uh Uh and uh for our design , um uh we have to discuss about it uh I think uh so uh the form of it so And that's it . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Uh thank you . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN About the components design . 
UNKNOWN Um for the energy source we can use a basic battery or , a as an optional thing , a kinetic energy , like in a watch , which you just shake and it produces energy . 
UNKNOWN But if we choose for that option , the docking station would c become obsolete . 
UNKNOWN So I don't think it's really an option . 
UNKNOWN Uh for the casing , uh the uh manufacturing department can deliver uh a flat casing , single or double curved casing . 
UNKNOWN It's really up the the design that we're gonna use . 
UNKNOWN It's uh doesn't uh imply any technical restrictions . 
UNKNOWN Uh as a case supplement , we could um , I thought of that l later , uh a rubber uh belt , like a anti-slip . 
UNKNOWN Uh for the b buttons , we can use plastic or rubber . 
UNKNOWN And the chip-set , um it says simple here , but it should be advanced , because we're using an L_C_D_ uh screen . 
UNKNOWN And as uh the trend-watcher presentationshowed , um people like wood , but it raises the price and it doesn't really fit the image , unless we would start two product lines . 
UNKNOWN Form should follow function overall . 
UNKNOWN Um well the kinetic energy source is rather fancy . 
UNKNOWN But depends on what we want . 
UNKNOWN I think we should disc discuss that . 
UNKNOWN Um for the case , uh the supplement and the buttons , it really depends on the designer . 
UNKNOWN And the chip-set uh really should be advanced because otherwise uh it would really be a simple uh remote control . 
UNKNOWN And that's it . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
THANKS Thank you . 
UNKNOWN So that brings us to the discussion about our concepts . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN So these are the points we have to discuss . 
UNKNOWN Um first I think we can talk about the energy source , since that's um has a pretty big influence on production price , uh and image . 
UNKNOWN Uh so uh f I think first of all we have to see uh it is possible to introduce kinetic energy in our budget , I think . 
UNKNOWN Yes w there there are four options . 
UNKNOWN We could use the basic normal battery . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh a hand dynamo . 
UNKNOWN But I don't think that's really an option . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN You don't wanna swing before you can watch television . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh solar cells . 
UNKNOWN But not every room is very light so it's not a very good option . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN Or the kinetic energy . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN And how exactly does the kinetic energy work ? 
UNKNOWN Well y you basically shake your remote , and then it powers up . 
UNKNOWN You just You use it and it works . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Nah . 
UNKNOWN Well personally I don't think that older people like to shake their remote control before they use it . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN That's true . 
UNKNOWN And besides that you mentioned it would make the docking station obsolete . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN And I think our docking station could be one of the marketing issues with which we can um get great popularity for our product . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But what's the function ? 
UNKNOWN Um wel Yeah you could load up the batteries , you could um insert the find the lost remote control function in there . 
UNKNOWN Yeah f for loading up uh the batteries . 
UNKNOWN B b Okay but uh it won't use uh much e energy uh I I believe . 
UNKNOWN Uh it's uh just a small display so I believe uh it will run on one battery for um six months or f or or more . 
UNKNOWN So I believe one battery uh is just enough . 
UNKNOWN Uh Uh well I think uh elderly people just like to have everything in place . 
UNKNOWN Uh so Okay . 
UNKNOWN That's true . 
UNKNOWN And I don't think they they like uh remotes just laying everywhere in their rooms . 
UNKNOWN So maybe a docking station will help them give the remote a place . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN That's true . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And also what you said . 
UNKNOWN Um you can introduce voice recognition by uh finding back your remote . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But I think it's um more efficient and cheaper to put it in the docking station . 
UNKNOWN So you have a but button on your docking station which you can push , and then it starts beeping . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN And then we can we can still use the voice recognition , but maybe then for only the the channels . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Uh . 
UNKNOWN That's safe . 
UNKNOWN I'm wondering um what will the voice recognition mean for the production price ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN That's a good point . 
UNKNOWN Mm I don't have any information on pricing . 
UNKNOWN So I'll have to ask the manufacturing department . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause in our earlier um market research , if you'd allow me to go to the flat board , SMARTboard . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , sure . 
UNKNOWN Go ahead . 
UNKNOWN Um so it was open here . 
UNKNOWN Um we also um asked if w they would , if people would pay more for speech recognition in a remote control . 
UNKNOWN Well you can see here , our target group would not do that . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN So if that would increase the price for which we're selling our remote control I would greatly advise not to do it . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think that would be better to uh insert in our other product , that is meant for the younger people . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But that would also go for the L_C_D_ screen then I guess . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN It's a bit higher percentage , but Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um well this is Yeah but this is here the question was , would you prefer it . 
UNKNOWN So that doesn't really mean they wouldn't pay extra for it . 
UNKNOWN And on top of that the L_C_D_ screen would um help in making the remote control easier to use . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And I think a voice recognition function would not make the remote control much easier to use . 
UNKNOWN Easier to use ? 
UNKNOWN No , I think that's a good point . 
UNKNOWN But uh is uh our uh research um about um bi large uh L_C_D_ sh uh display , or uh just a small one uh we want to uh use ? 
UNKNOWN Um well this was for like an L_C_D_ screen like you would have on a on the the most advanced mobile phones . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So pretty large . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I personally think the L_C_D_ screen we wanna use , with the extra information , I think nobody has anything against it . 
UNKNOWN Because it's just uh some extra information , and it's easy to ignore as well . 
NEGATION No . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So if you don't wanna use it you just don't use it . 
UNKNOWN And um yeah I think the um Maybe we have to uh discard the voice recognition . 
UNKNOWN Because it will increase cost uh signifi uh significantly . 
UNKNOWN And I don't think the I don't think it will be a lot easier to use , as well . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So that brings us back to the energy . 
UNKNOWN If we don't have the voice recognition , it will it won't use a lot of energy to use . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um So in that case we could use kinetic uh energy , but I think just a simple battery which you can reload on a docking station is just as good . 
UNKNOWN And much cheaper as well . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So Okay let me just choose for the battery . 
UNKNOWN And that's the best choice . 
UNKNOWN That brings us to the chip . 
UNKNOWN Well there isn't any choice there because we're using the the the the display . 
UNKNOWN Just the advanced . 
UNKNOWN So it's gotta be advanced . 
UNKNOWN Okay , advanced chip . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN And then we get to the point of the case . 
UNKNOWN Um which brings us a little bit back to marketing as well . 
UNKNOWN Uh if we wanna choose for wood or the black and grey . 
UNKNOWN Or both ? 
UNKNOWN Um as we saw there is not Yeah wood is a lot more expensive to produce . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um but I think it will attract elderly people who wanna have something exclusive , which they can show off to their grandkids . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Look I've got a new remote control , and uh Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well And I think most important factor there is the wooden colour . 
UNKNOWN Uh I dunno . 
UNKNOWN So it wouldn't actually have to be wood , if it's just wood-coloured . 
UNKNOWN That's right . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN But with colour was a lot more expensive ? 
UNKNOWN Or ? 
UNKNOWN Mm I dunno . 
UNKNOWN You don't know ? 
UNKNOWN I'll have to uh research . 
UNKNOWN I think so because Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Probably . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN It's a lot more difficult to to handle and to to get in the right shape . 
UNKNOWN Uh is it possible uh to make um changeable uh case . 
UNKNOWN So um uh you 'cause uh Yeah with uh mobile phones uh uh so uh like the Nokia mobile phones , uh when you can change the case of it . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So maybe it's possible uh possibility . 
UNKNOWN Change the cases . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So um um you have just to make one um standard um remote control , and um yeah you can sell uh few uh Yeah . 
UNKNOWN You can sell the cases . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think that's a very good option . 
UNKNOWN Because um then you can advertise as well with the Give your grandfather a new case for his remote control , or whatever . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Because that's a it's something extra , it's something other remotes don't have , which we can get a great advantage point . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah that is true . 
UNKNOWN So and then you can make them with colour . 
UNKNOWN Black and grey , other colours as well . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN We would have to look carefully into the design though . 
UNKNOWN Costs . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause we would have to make one w uh control which would fit in with a wooden cover and a plastic cover . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN The more original one , or the more standard one . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So that would Well I wouldn't design a telephone but Well no I think w we should just , we should then just design one um one remote , but it would have to be fancy with either the wood cover or the plastic one . 
UNKNOWN So you suggest we should design two different telephones on which you can apply , yeah remote controls , on which you can apply different case covers , for example . 
UNKNOWN Remote . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So , but that shouldn't be too much of a problem . 
UNKNOWN So everybody's okay with the changing covers ? 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN I think that's a good uh good option . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Changing case covers . 
UNKNOWN Um I heard our Industrial Designer talk about uh flat , single and double curved . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Could you explain that a little more ? 
UNKNOWN Well the the general like most older remotes are flat , just straight . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN And uh our d manufacturing department can also deliver single curved or double curved ca curved cases . 
UNKNOWN And what would single curved and double curved mean ? 
UNKNOWN Um it would just only affect the form , for as far as I know . 
UNKNOWN So it's j really just up to the design department what we're gonna use . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN It doesn't really matter for the price or the functionality . 
UNKNOWN So we can pretty much just do whatever we want . 
UNKNOWN Pick one you like , yes . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN That's good . 
UNKNOWN Uh but the form has to be um It has to It's has to be possible to stand up ? 
UNKNOWN Or just only to lie down ? 
UNKNOWN No just to lie down . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN And the the cover of the the docking station is also on top of the television then ? 
UNKNOWN We'll go for that . 
UNKNOWN Or not ? 
UNKNOWN Well or besides it . 
UNKNOWN And you can just yeah then click it in . 
UNKNOWN That's okay . 
UNKNOWN Um so the interface . 
UNKNOWN What type of interface do we want to use ? 
UNKNOWN Um maybe you can make a little drawingof it on the on the the board . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Does somebody have ideas for a form or Yep . 
UNKNOWN Uh we can just use the regular form of it , but it's um not quite uh fancy . 
UNKNOWN So um Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um you uh said you wanted to put the um changing channels button on the right side , so you could , so your thumb would be easily Well uh I think that was a very good point 'cause I pointed out earlier that a lot of remotes cause R_S_I_ . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So that would be great for that . 
UNKNOWN Um I thought maybe we could just make one of those buttons on both the left and the right side . 
UNKNOWN For uh Uh for Yeah yeah . 
UNKNOWN For left-handed users also . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah we um Is it possible to um program it s so uh you got on the left side uh or on the right side uh buttons for for shifting u up and shifting up ? 
UNKNOWN And on the uh other uh uh o other side uh buttons for uh shifting , uh for for the sound ? 
UNKNOWN For the volume . 
UNKNOWN Or Or isn't it ? 
UNKNOWN Um well that could Yeah we could do that but I'm not sure if that would be very good for the easy , ease of use . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Usabili Yeah ease of use will be a lot more difficult , and then it's But you have extra buttons . 
UNKNOWN Yeah okay . 
CONFUSION Uh . 
UNKNOWN But if we would make um a changing channels and changing volume button on both sides , that would certainly yield great options for the design of the remote . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause it could be made all symmetrical and stuff . 
UNKNOWN Yeah but Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So people can get confused . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN That is true . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Especially if they have the same writings on it . 
UNKNOWN See um yeah . 
UNKNOWN Or we have to make a left uh For lefties and Um You mean um Yeah if Mm no . 
UNKNOWN Can't we make uh Can't we make a remote which you can flip over and use on the same functions as the normal one ? 
UNKNOWN Then you have to Let's see if I ca A blank one . 
UNKNOWN And then you get Here's a little L_C_D_ screen . 
UNKNOWN Uh now I have to think . 
UNKNOWN It's a plus and a min . 
UNKNOWN No it's not very handy I think . 
UNKNOWN Because the plus and the min will be opposite and all kinds of No that's not gonna work . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I guess . 
UNKNOWN Maybe we should Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But is it a problem that left-handed persons use a different hand ? 
UNKNOWN I think the functions are that basic that nobody should have any problems with uh choosing a channel or Y yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN That is true . 
UNKNOWN It's just uh u using uh your thumb . 
UNKNOWN So um it's Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think we could just uh leave it a normal shape . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh but maybe we have to make it a l a bit more fancy . 
UNKNOWN In one or ano another way . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um Yeah yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think we should start by by choosing a case . 
UNKNOWN Because that's the basis you're building on . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um yeah just Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So I could drawthem out . 
UNKNOWN Let's look at the flat case . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN It's from the side so it's rather normal . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN The the single curved so I'm not really sure what they're gonna look like , but I think it's something like this . 
UNKNOWN So this type should be better for you or better Should prevent repetitive strain injury a bit . 
UNKNOWN Easier ? 
UNKNOWN And the double curved s looks something like this I guess . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN So th those are the three options we have . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN I suggest um the single curved , because maybe the curve is pretty good to put the the screen in . 
UNKNOWN Uh so that elderly people can uh use the remote control and at the same time look easily at the screen , because it's a bit , it has a bit of a angle . 
UNKNOWN So um Do you say this um S uh Uh you got like uh sort of a I believe There ? 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So um you want to put a display over here ? 
UNKNOWN Or not ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think so . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But now it's Do you have it upside down or Do you have it this that's top ? 
UNKNOWN Uh we can make it um Mm ? 
UNKNOWN That's the top . 
UNKNOWN So uh this top . 
UNKNOWN This down . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um maybe it's possible to uh make this side like um Let's see . 
UNKNOWN Um Colour uh okay . 
UNKNOWN Uh to make this side um like mm the right colour . 
UNKNOWN Um bit like so uh um in the form of your hand . 
UNKNOWN So um Uh it's an So so the remote control have to um lay in your hand . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So uh it's possib um yeah for s so and And to put uh the the buttons for um changing uh the channel uh over here uh Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So get your mouse . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN That's a good one . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But I think it's better to put the screen uh on top . 
UNKNOWN Uh rem Yeah but this place um Uh it's Yeah I dunno um Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So just flip it a hundred and eighty degrees around then you get here . 
UNKNOWN If you can have this one , you turn it like this . 
UNKNOWN And then flip it upside down . 
UNKNOWN Because uh maybe your hand is in the way , if you have the display here . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN It's more logical to have it on top as well because , like on your mobile phone , it's always above . 
UNKNOWN I think i On top . 
UNKNOWN Yeah so So Five minutes . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Oh maybe you should just s start on a blank page. 
UNKNOWN . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So then we get Here's That's the curve . 
UNKNOWN Here the display , and then buttons . 
UNKNOWN Yeah and then we can have a little bit off here and here maybe . 
UNKNOWN Just that's for left hand and right hand users . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN And then h the rest of the buttons over here . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But um the on-off button , um still on the top uh Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah still here jus That's Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And I'd prefer the corners to be round . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN Think that would be better . 
UNKNOWN Should be more bit more friendly , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Friendly on the eye . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN Supplements . 
UNKNOWN That's okay . 
UNKNOWN Where's my mouse ? 
UNKNOWN Then We've got a general idea of the concepts and the materials we're going to use . 
UNKNOWN So now for the next meeting uh we'll have to look at the look-and-feel design . 
UNKNOWN It's important that the corporate design image uh is going to be in the remote . 
UNKNOWN So check out the corporate website maybe . 
UNKNOWN The user interface design , it's the same story . 
UNKNOWN And product evaluation . 
UNKNOWN So the Industrial Designer and User Interface Designer are going to work together on this one . 
UNKNOWN But you're going to get your instructions I think sended by the coach . 
UNKNOWN So just um I will put these um minuteson the in the folder . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN And then we're going to uh try to finish our project , and uh make a good design for all the grandfathers and grandmothers , I think . 
UNKNOWN Which are Uh let's see . 
UNKNOWN I'm not sure if you're going to start right away to work together or I think you're going to fill in the questionnaires first . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And then you'll get a message . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So that's uh basically it . 
UNKNOWN Maybe this one ? 
UNKNOWN Then we can save this one in the foldersgroup . 
UNKNOWN Uh yes , it's here . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN SMARTboard , there it it . 
UNKNOWN So if you wanna have a look at it , it's over there in the projects folder . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And then I guess we'll start in thirty minutes again . 
THANKS Thank you . 
CONFIRMATION Very good . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Two . 
GREETING Hello . 
UNKNOWN Good morning . 
GREETING Hello . 
GREETING Hello . 
UNKNOWN Ah . 
UNKNOWN You have to put it exactly on the on the yeah . 
UNKNOWN Plate ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Good morning . 
UNKNOWN Good morning . 
UNKNOWN I took your mouse . 
UNKNOWN Should I bring my uh pen too ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah just yeah , no , that's for me , I just have to make some notes. 
UNKNOWN Or Okay . 
UNKNOWN I got my uh mouse . 
UNKNOWN Uh I also forgot my mouse , but I don't need my mouse , I think . 
UNKNOWN Mouse . 
UNKNOWN I do . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Come on . 
UNKNOWN There we are . 
UNKNOWN My laptop is crashing . 
UNKNOWN Damn computers . 
UNKNOWN Cr Help help help . 
UNKNOWN Let's just check one more time . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Can you hear me ? 
UNKNOWN Hello ? 
UNKNOWN Test . 
UNKNOWN Uh actually my laptop doesn't work , switch it on again . 
UNKNOWN I dunno . 
UNKNOWN Check . 
UNKNOWN Oh no . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN I think it works . 
UNKNOWN Test test . 
UNKNOWN Yes , it's working . 
UNKNOWN So you all read what we are going to do or not ? 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN We're gonna make a remote control . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's right . 
UNKNOWN I think my laptop is a bit etchy . 
UNKNOWN I just made a a simple uh presentation. 
UNKNOWN So you put some things in it . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN How does this work ? 
UNKNOWN I dunno . 
UNKNOWN One uh most to the right . 
UNKNOWN Uh p Okay . 
UNKNOWN Yes that one . 
UNKNOWN This one ? 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN Press F_ eleven . 
UNKNOWN Ah cool . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So that's my name , . 
UNKNOWN Uh we're going to make uh a remote control , you already know that . 
UNKNOWN Just have a look , are we going to uh this agendaof our meeting . 
UNKNOWN You know , this is about twenty five minutes , this meeting . 
UNKNOWN So um the thing we have to know is you already know what we're going to do , you also read what this the things or , not yet , okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN So um , yeah , it has to be original , trendy , user-friendly that's what we're going to design . 
UNKNOWN Uh first we have uh uh three steps of uh making the the remote control . 
UNKNOWN Fir the first thing is th the functional design , that's very important . 
UNKNOWN We have to look what the needs are , the effects of the functional design , and and how the mm the the remote control works , so that's where we're going to look in the functional design , it's for the f next meeting . 
UNKNOWN The the second thing is the conceptual design , that's what it that's uh the spe the specifications of the components and the properties and the specifications of the user interface . 
UNKNOWN And we have to look what uh the market is doing for what kind of uh remote controls are in the market . 
UNKNOWN And the third thing is uh the detailed design um and that's exa yeah , you know what it is , it's exactly how it looks and whatever . 
UNKNOWN Okay so uh no , this is a these are two smartboards , with the uh f uh s an introduction of that one . 
UNKNOWN And you already saw you know all that that you here can put uh things in the the red project uh map. 
UNKNOWN Folder , yes . 
UNKNOWN Folder , okay . 
UNKNOWN So no okay have a look at that one . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So uh what we're going to do first is um so you can read . 
UNKNOWN You have to uh drawuh a favourite animal on the whiteboard and um and say why it's your favourite animal . 
UNKNOWN So and you have this is just to try it out and we have to uh use a different pen colours and different thickness of the pen . 
UNKNOWN So okay , so first have to show you , maybe you can come here to have a look how it works . 
UNKNOWN Yes ? 
UNKNOWN Ah I can see it now . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN This a new page, it's okay . 
UNKNOWN Use pen format . 
UNKNOWN and a different colour can use here no I just take the pink . 
UNKNOWN You take oh there's no pink , okay , oh just purple , okay . 
UNKNOWN Purple . 
UNKNOWN No blue . 
UNKNOWN And uh line width ten . 
UNKNOWN Okay uh just take what I'm going to drawis an elephant . 
UNKNOWN Just drawslowly , because otherwise it won't work . 
UNKNOWN It's a very nice elephant , you can see . 
UNKNOWN I dunno what it looks but it doesn't matter . 
UNKNOWN Looks very nice . 
UNKNOWN I just h Something like this ? 
UNKNOWN Oh no Yeah , okay . 
UNKNOWN It look like a dinosaurs . 
UNKNOWN Because I like uh okay . 
UNKNOWN A pink elephant . 
UNKNOWN Just takes so long , okay . 
UNKNOWN Whatever , just . 
UNKNOWN You erased this one . 
UNKNOWN It's a bit slow you can see , this is a bit annoying . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so just for you guys just one of you can drawa painting if you want . 
UNKNOWN Let me try one . 
UNKNOWN Just don't um yeah , just u use it like that , yeah . 
UNKNOWN That's okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Okay and then uh what's the colour ? 
UNKNOWN How do I do Ah . 
UNKNOWN It's in format . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I'll take this one . 
UNKNOWN Uh there has to be water , but Yeah yeah , but it's an animal it's an animal that lives in the water . 
UNKNOWN Just No it has to be an animal , so if that's it's it should be a shna snake or something . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Okay okay . 
UNKNOWN The water is important . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So I first uh drawthe water . 
CONFUSION Uh . 
UNKNOWN Okay , and now I make the animal . 
UNKNOWN It's a fish . 
CONFIRMATION Okay , cool . 
UNKNOWN Wow . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So . 
UNKNOWN Um This is a worm . 
UNKNOWN Hmm yeah , that's nice . 
UNKNOWN Wow . 
UNKNOWN Okay , who next ? 
UNKNOWN Uh do you have to write down why uh that doesn't matter , just it's to get used to the whiteboard , but it's okay . 
UNKNOWN Uh Okay . 
UNKNOWN Just make a new blank new blank page. 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well Paul ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Like this ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , not too far to the to the t pen top . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um let's make it um a dog . 
UNKNOWN Ooh . 
UNKNOWN Maybe you should hold your pen a bit more to the back , so that no , to the yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think it's a pig . 
UNKNOWN Ah okay . 
UNKNOWN A pig ? 
UNKNOWN I can make a dog . 
UNKNOWN No , it's a dog . 
UNKNOWN Or a dog . 
UNKNOWN A sheep ? 
UNKNOWN Um 'Kay , I make a cat of it . 
UNKNOWN Uh we d only have twenty five minutes , so . 
UNKNOWN Take it easy . 
UNKNOWN I I was gonna make a cat too . 
UNKNOWN Use your fantasy . 
UNKNOWN Oh , not too quick . 
UNKNOWN Just hold it more more to the back then you don't have okay . 
UNKNOWN No I have it . 
UNKNOWN I just drawtoo quick I think . 
UNKNOWN Okay , that's it . 
UNKNOWN More . 
UNKNOWN No , that's okay , thank you . 
UNKNOWN It's just to get used to it . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN I thought these pens would be just um uh you write it down and you download it to Word , you already did it or no ? 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN No , not yet , okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's right , it but you actually got to write on the paper. 
UNKNOWN But it's just Sorry ? 
UNKNOWN You really got to write on that paper. 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I know , but I d I I thought it would be just in in in uh typed words in Word , so that's not just it's just a picture . 
UNKNOWN Yeah yeah , it's a real pen . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but it's just a picture . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN So it's not that cool as I th thought it would be . 
UNKNOWN You really No . 
UNKNOWN Y you can you can't edit in the edit it in Word . 
NEGATION No . 
CONFIRMATION Oh , okay . 
UNKNOWN It's a donkey . 
UNKNOWN I don't know , what time did we start this meeting , I'm not sure . 
UNKNOWN Uh I think it was uh Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Half past . 
UNKNOWN Half past ten . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Brilliant . 
UNKNOWN Okay , perfect . 
UNKNOWN Nice , eh ? 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , thank you . 
UNKNOWN Now we just have to save everything , so . 
UNKNOWN Oh this is definitely the best one . 
CONFUSION Uh . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so uh what we know is that we have to sell this uh remote control for about twenty five Euros . 
UNKNOWN Excuse me . 
UNKNOWN Okay , that's . 
UNKNOWN And uh we have to make a profit of fifty million Euros , so we have to uh use a big market in Europe . 
UNKNOWN Piece of cake . 
UNKNOWN The production cost are about half the price of selling price , sorry . 
UNKNOWN Uh easy . 
UNKNOWN So can someone make a a calculation about how many we have to sell of these to make fifty million , I dunno . 
UNKNOWN Uh so we're gonna have a little discussion about um what experience are with a remote control the and everything , so just have a look how it we think about remote controls . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , my first question was does it have to be a a universal remote control ? 
UNKNOWN Oh yeah , that's a good question . 
UNKNOWN Because we sell it uh uh uh lonely from the t and not with the television , we sell it uh apart . 
UNKNOWN I think it's I'm not I'm not sure , it's not mm I think I don't think you can buy a a a universal uh remote control for twenty five Euros , so not sure , but Okay , so we we just say we just say that's universal remote control . 
UNKNOWN So I Because Yeah , I know uh you can buy a re a universal uh control for uh only twenty uh Euros Yeah , I think . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , it probably would be universal . 
UNKNOWN Universal . 
UNKNOWN And only television ? 
UNKNOWN Or more devices ? 
UNKNOWN Hmm , maybe , I don't know . 
UNKNOWN Ah okay . 
UNKNOWN Okay , perfect . 
UNKNOWN And uh also for the V_C_R_ and uh D_V_D_ player and okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , everything just so a lot of buttons on the remote control . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , probably . 
UNKNOWN Not just a T_V_ . 
UNKNOWN No , just everything . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN so yeah , what what what's a remote control , it's just a black thing with some buttons on it , it's not nothing very special , but um yeah , that's right . 
UNKNOWN Well we can try to make it special . 
UNKNOWN So do you have any ideas how it has to look for for usability or user Hmm yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well I th I thought about um making it the same uh style as the television , we don't have uh the same television uh all the time , so uh that's no matter . 
UNKNOWN Um if we uh control the V_C_R_ and the D_V_D_ player player with it uh it has to be clear , because uh kids and uh elderly are gonna use it , so uh it's not only for the uh technical persons . 
UNKNOWN Um I think it must be a very good control , so you can uh uh uh act uh use it from uh everywhere in your room , the the infrared uh thing must be from very good quality . 
UNKNOWN That's right . 
UNKNOWN Should be a good point . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Nothing N It shouldn't be too big , but I don't think we can make it too small , 'cause it has to have a lot of functions , so . 
UNKNOWN And how big should it be ? 
NEGATION No . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I dunno um Yes Ah that's that's Ah right right . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN We can't make it smaller than the things we see now I think . 
UNKNOWN Just big enough for the buttons we have , that's that's it . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Or we have to make something uh like uh mobile phones that you can uh fold it opem . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Maybe then you can make it s smaller and uniquer , maybe more trendy . 
UNKNOWN But you you you you think about uh uh one you can fold open . 
UNKNOWN Fold open , where you can see uh more options . 
UNKNOWN Okay , yeah , that's cool . 
UNKNOWN I think Yeah , something uh on top , just dren general things like volume and T_V_ channels and inside things you don't use that often . 
UNKNOWN Yeah n Yeah , or you c O or you could th think of an uh uh a small touch screen on the remote control . 
UNKNOWN Maybe for the D_V_D_ pla player or something , if you just okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Oh that's good , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah b I wanted No you can make an uh manual in it . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Why should you use a touchscreen on a remote control ? 
UNKNOWN Uh maybe be uh it's it's Yeah , or um maybe to keep it uh easy and uh small . 
UNKNOWN There are buttons on it . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but Yeah but it's not reachable I think , touch screen . 
UNKNOWN But it's not t t t too expensive to put a touchscreen on it . 
UNKNOWN But that's Yeah , I think it's much uh too expensive . 
UNKNOWN Uh like a a to have Yeah , maybe it would . 
UNKNOWN And we have to care for uh the strength of the remote control , because uh uh remote controls are most uh things in the house that falls down on the ground and it get often uh broken . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So . 
UNKNOWN And if you have a touch screen in it , it's definitely too too fragile uh fragile . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , too fragile . 
UNKNOWN Yeah and a lots uh uh lots of kids use it and touchscreen is not uh kids uh Um Ma maybe a home station . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN You can put games on your remote control . 
UNKNOWN Kid-proof . 
UNKNOWN Whatever . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And uh how about the batteries ? 
UNKNOWN Uh should you put it in a recharger or a just Mm yeah . 
UNKNOWN Oh maybe that's a good idea , just to put it on your television and just s recharge , you never have to use any batteries . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Maybe that's a good idea , but yeah , we have to look at the price now I think . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , how m how mu how how expensive uh is a normal recharger ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I dunno . 
UNKNOWN Well uh how much is your uh standards uh mobile phone recharger ? 
UNKNOWN I dunno . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , if you buy it uh separately from your phone it's probably expensive , but I don't know what the project uh projection costs are for such a thing . 
UNKNOWN Ah yeah . 
UNKNOWN Maybe have uh Yeah , 'cause well Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh if you th look at the market , it's probably it's still the best way just to put batteries in it , because maybe it's too expensive . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but a home station is uh a really good idea , because uh lots of people are uh lose their remote control and don't know where it is , and now you can put it always at the same place . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's right , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Maybe it's Therefore it's a good idea , but maybe it's expensive . 
UNKNOWN Maybe uh use it as a separate option . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Sell it uh separately . 
UNKNOWN You can yeah , you can buy it with it . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but I have a mouse that's uh uh also uh Yeah , and and you just have normal batteries that you can recharge and just put it in the station , or you can change your batteries , so . 
UNKNOWN Rechargeable . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Oh yeah . 
UNKNOWN The option , just the option , that's cool . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh I I set something on paperalready , size , looks , uh usable , uh the buttons on usable places , uh the the on off button must be on top , uh it has to lay good in the hand , you you have to uh Yeah , I don't I don't know I don't know if we You can make it very special , to create our own um looks , but it's very hard to Nah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Has it be has does it has to b have to be um uh like a different form than a normal remote control or Yeah Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well I think we have to look at that , 'cause well you can do the standard way , but then you won't Well you can um have uh the basic things on the same place , like on off button on top and the T_V_ channels one two three four as a block , and then the volume uh obviously on t on top , so you can see . 
UNKNOWN N uh if if we want to make it special , we probably have to do a lot of testing , if it really works . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But the rest is uh you don't use that often , so if you have a clear button with an good icon on it , it should be clear as well . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So it doesn't matter what place it is on the remote control I think , so you can do something unique with that . 
UNKNOWN And what we have to think about too is uh uh buttons that you use often are um maybe uh like when you fold it open , when you have it closed , you can still uh do the th the functions . 
UNKNOWN Yeah yeah , what Paul already said . 
UNKNOWN Uh on on top are the the basic options on top , and if you fold it open Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , just for the T_V_ and just the normal function , that's fine . 
UNKNOWN But n yeah , but uh i basically when I'm watching T_V_ I'm just using like five buttons or so , so . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah . 
UNKNOWN But maybe it's maybe it's very hard to to make it fold open and to l look like it's very uh uh what's it's called ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN That's what I meant . 
UNKNOWN If you if if you make to fold open it's or also an uh the strength uh is not s as good as a normal uh remote control . 
UNKNOWN Uh Okay , but yeah . 
UNKNOWN Maybe it's hard t No , that's right . 
UNKNOWN So maybe we have to to uh keep it like mm a square , just normal remote control . 
UNKNOWN Just think about it . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN We have to close this uh to finish this uh meeting , so . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN There's some more things . 
UNKNOWN We have uh another thirty minutes , so then we're going to meet again . 
UNKNOWN So you know what you have to what you have to do ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um for m for me uh the Marketing Expert , the user requirements uh specification , do I need to think as a user , a as a a a only the looks and the Okay . 
UNKNOWN No , what you want to do with it . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I think this if you you have to n know if it's for s a T_V_ , a D_V_D_ player , all that things . 
UNKNOWN Also from a user , but all these things together . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , it's also about strength and uh for everything uh . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , everything . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I also wrote down some stuff that you want on a Technical fun fu What do you want to do with your remote control , what do you need on your remote control . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , no maybe not not uh , that's not a f that's something for for for yeah . 
UNKNOWN That's not for you . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Just if what's in the market , what's normal , uh what kind of uh buttons do you have . 
UNKNOWN I already wrote some down , some ideas . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , it's alright . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , just is that okay ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN There's already a documentin the folder about it . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , me too . 
UNKNOWN So see you in thirty minutes . 
UNKNOWN Okay , well done . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN For the next time you have to uh put it exactly on the square , so your laptop . 
UNKNOWN I will . 
UNKNOWN Oh Paul . 
UNKNOWN It didn't say that . 
UNKNOWN No , sorry . 
UNKNOWN Your fault . 
UNKNOWN Ciao . 
UNKNOWN Bye bye . 
UNKNOWN Bye bye . 
UNKNOWN I just forgot their name , so uh you're i sorry , I just forgot them all . 
UNKNOWN So I have to write it down . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So Do you know them or Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Fine . 
UNKNOWN The names ? 
UNKNOWN For for for my sur um Jens . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , no , but your b your surname . 
UNKNOWN Uh Damman . 
UNKNOWN D_ A_ W_ . 
UNKNOWN W_O_ da . 
UNKNOWN Uh uh M_ M_ . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN I mean M_ . 
UNKNOWN Double M_ . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN And what's your name ? 
UNKNOWN Paul Wiezer . 
UNKNOWN Paul Wiezer . 
UNKNOWN W_I_E_S_ z Z_ or S_ ? 
UNKNOWN A_ E_ Z_ zee zee E_ R_ . 
UNKNOWN Uh uh zee . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN What's your name ? 
UNKNOWN Uh Martijn . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but your surname . 
UNKNOWN What ? 
UNKNOWN Your surname . 
UNKNOWN Uh Abbing . 
UNKNOWN A_ B_ B_ I_ N_ G_ . 
UNKNOWN Okay , thanks . 
UNKNOWN I was a little short on time , but What ? 
CONFUSION Uh . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , me too , so that's not No no no , I just fi first my So let's have a look , we have forty minutes , so it's it's more than enough . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , same here . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN Sorry . 
UNKNOWN Uh let's see . 
UNKNOWN Which one was mine ? 
UNKNOWN Okay , perfect . 
UNKNOWN So we have Oh no , what's that ? 
UNKNOWN So so we have uh forty minutes for this uh for this second meeting , and we have to make uh sure that we going t that we are sure , that we are , that we know what we're going to make uh th what the product is going to like look like . 
UNKNOWN Good . 
UNKNOWN Uh first I have the notesof the last meeting , so I showed uh show them to you . 
UNKNOWN Oh , sorry about that , I just escape this one . 
UNKNOWN How do I escape this ? 
UNKNOWN How do I I escape this s uh presentation? 
UNKNOWN Uh left . 
UNKNOWN Uh Just Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Ah okay . 
UNKNOWN So Okay . 
UNKNOWN And show , sorry . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so let's have a look s at this one . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so the f the f the points we had last meeting was the um Should be a univ uh universal remote control No , that's I uh s I just got a emailfrom the from the personal coach and it should be a T_V_ remote control only . 
UNKNOWN So have you changed that part ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um so yeah , it still has to be uh f a r a remote control for kids and elderly . 
UNKNOWN It's it's still the same . 
UNKNOWN Um All these points uh we have to look at . 
UNKNOWN You all know them . 
UNKNOWN But uh there's another point . 
UNKNOWN The um uh the main uh people of interest of this company are forty plus people . 
UNKNOWN So they're old and not younger people . 
UNKNOWN So we have to look at that as well . 
UNKNOWN 'Specially old people , maybe bi bigger buttons or something , I dunno . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , okay . 
UNKNOWN Uh so So yeah , that's it , so just you can do your presentationfor uh Oh it doesn't matter , just start with the I I didn't read i read it , so it's not for me , I didn't get it uh anyway . 
UNKNOWN Which one first ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Uh Okay . 
UNKNOWN Functional requirements , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well my name is Jens Damman , but we're in a group , and I I will start it . 
CONFUSION Wait .
UNKNOWN Um I've used a marketing reporton uh the site . 
UNKNOWN Uh I think you've uh read it too . 
UNKNOWN Uh and uh f and furthermore I uh surfed the o the other site . 
UNKNOWN You didn't read it ? 
UNKNOWN No , I didn don't thing we got it . 
UNKNOWN Oh okay , I I was the only one who get it . 
UNKNOWN It's only for you . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN Okay it was uh uh uh um um a reportabout uh an experiment with uh a lot of users . 
UNKNOWN And uh they had a lot of findings in their reportuh with statistical uh uh uh thing uh with statistical uh proof . 
UNKNOWN So I um I had three pageswith findings and sev a lot of uh a lot of findings . 
UNKNOWN So we can use this uh to uh create our own remote control . 
UNKNOWN Uh seventy five percent of the users find uh most remote controls ugly . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I think uh uh that's a lot , so we have to make a beautiful remote control . 
UNKNOWN Uh eighty percent of users would spend when uh a remote control will l uh look fancy . 
UNKNOWN I think this fits uh at the uh what what uh Michael said about uh older people . 
UNKNOWN Older people will uh spend more money uh for uh something uh uh what's good . 
UNKNOWN Because younger people are more critical uh about uh uh where they spend their money money at . 
UNKNOWN Uh seventy five percent uh seventy five percent of the users say they zap a lot . 
UNKNOWN Well okay , that's uh normal . 
UNKNOWN I think uh we we have to make uh good zap buttons . 
UNKNOWN But that's one of our requirements . 
UNKNOWN The last point is quite an interesting So if we Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yes , fifty percent of users say they only use ten percent of the buttons . 
UNKNOWN Um Martijn alr already said it . 
UNKNOWN And uh maybe our uh fold open system is is a good one , but I don't think it's uh reachable . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , we should have the ten percent on the on the top , then you're you're So we have uh a new uh age of forty plus . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , the ten percent on the top , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN That that's a good one . 
UNKNOWN Um uh pagetwo . 
UNKNOWN Remote controls are often lost somewhere in the room . 
UNKNOWN That's exactly what we said about um maybe a home station for uh for it uh to uh recharge the batteries or something . 
UNKNOWN Uh I thought mo maybe we could make a clap system , so when you clap your hands it will beep or something . 
UNKNOWN Uh you must find it uh quickly . 
CONFUSION Uh . 
UNKNOWN Maybe just a button on the home station . 
UNKNOWN So remote control beeps when you click that button on the home station . 
CONFIRMATION Okay , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , we can uh combine that . 
UNKNOWN Uh it takes too much time to learn how to use a r new remote control . 
UNKNOWN Uh I think we must t uh take a look at this . 
UNKNOWN It's only uh th thirty four of the thirty four percent . 
UNKNOWN But it's uh a tough one . 
UNKNOWN Because if we make a ha whole new product , our own style , we we c uh this is so difficult , uh a difficulty I think . 
UNKNOWN Uh next , remote controls are bad for R_S_I_ . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but only if they zap a lot , and they watch over five hours T_V_ or something . 
UNKNOWN I don't We we haven't Uh we mustn't look too much at uh the last point . 
UNKNOWN Okay , last page. 
UNKNOWN Uh the last uh experiment uh was about gadgets , like uh speech recognition . 
UNKNOWN We didn't uh think about that already . 
UNKNOWN And uh an L_C_D_ on the remote control . 
UNKNOWN We already thought about that . 
UNKNOWN Um uh they finally had a conclusion that younger people um uh under an age of f forty five are uh more interested in new features . 
UNKNOWN And but they're more critical . 
UNKNOWN And older people uh want to spend uh more money . 
UNKNOWN But uh they uh they don't want to uh have a lot of uh new features , because they're in their old uh thinking way . 
UNKNOWN And they want to keep the old uh things the old things . 
UNKNOWN But y But you but you already said that the uh company was about uh forty plus uh clients ? 
UNKNOWN People . 
UNKNOWN So yeah , so we just can skip the L_C_D_ r on the remote control , because Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I I think we can speak , uh we can skip speech recognition uh directly , because it's not reachable for twenty five Euros . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It's too Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um then I have my personal uh preference . 
UNKNOWN Okay , that's not very good , because I thought about television , D_V_D_ player , stereo and V_C_R_ . 
UNKNOWN I had a question about . 
UNKNOWN But it's already out of the question , this . 
UNKNOWN Um my point is , well , I If we ma uh make a a remote uh control for only television , I think it's hard to uh sell it for twenty five Euros . 
UNKNOWN But it's the exercise . 
UNKNOWN Because it's too expensive . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , only only for television uh On the market you can now buy for twenty Euros a remote control for everything . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , probably . 
UNKNOWN And we only make it for television , so we mi mm we m must made it make it uh very special . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but good usability , so you can use it . 
UNKNOWN Okay , I told about the home station . 
UNKNOWN Uh it must be simple , because uh our the the elderly people uh needs to use it . 
UNKNOWN And I I found a motto . 
UNKNOWN And we put the fashion in electronics . 
UNKNOWN And that's uh the motto we are uh referenced to uh for our uh our style . 
UNKNOWN We we have to make a a new product . 
UNKNOWN We have to be um Yeah . 
UNKNOWN One of a kind , I think . 
UNKNOWN So it has to look uh uh uh unique , but Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Unique . 
UNKNOWN The company is about our uh th th their own fashion , their own style . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I reckon Uh I think mm Uh Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But old people are not looking for that . 
UNKNOWN Not really . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think the main thing is the usability , that's where we can uh make it a special product . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , to k to keep it simple when you Sorry I thought about it , yes . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But uh we also have to stand out , 'cause there are already , like you said , so many controls out that support lot of stuff . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But we have to make sure that we're better usability , and stand out by just looks of it . 
UNKNOWN So make it just a different colour or different shape , so Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Okay , this was uh my presentation. 
CONFIRMATION Thanks . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN I don't Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So Paul , you can do the next one if you want . 
UNKNOWN You can ask some questions or something . 
UNKNOWN Yeah well Uh . 
UNKNOWN It's on the on the uh net net uh thing , isn't it ? 
UNKNOWN There it is . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Technical functions design . 
UNKNOWN Okay , well , so we have s mm uh broad audience . 
UNKNOWN Isn't that isn't true anymore . 
UNKNOWN But um we have elderly people , so we need to keep it simple . 
UNKNOWN Uh the way I want to keep it simple is to use the sen uh standard . 
UNKNOWN So standardised uh methods like uh on all uh remote controls . 
UNKNOWN Not too full , like uh Jens already said , only ten percent is being used . 
UNKNOWN So what do you think of only the numbers and the on-off button or Okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I have it on the next page. 
UNKNOWN But yes uh basic functions like numbers and that sort of stuff . 
UNKNOWN Um so the options that we put on there should be easy to use , and 'cause you have more room then , and for elderly people big buttons . 
UNKNOWN Uh an icon on it or text on it , so it's very clear what that buttons does . 
UNKNOWN So it doesn't take much time to figure out uh how to use it . 
UNKNOWN Um a way to find out uh what people use is maybe just to use uh questionnaires on the internet or just ask some random people , elderly people what they use , what they want on a remote control to find out . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But there is already in a one done . 
UNKNOWN Of functions I could think of . 
UNKNOWN Uh volume , channels , the the basic according to . 
UNKNOWN Just one two three etcetera . 
UNKNOWN Uh text service options . 
UNKNOWN Um basic on-off . 
UNKNOWN And I found an uh Could I think of favourites ? 
UNKNOWN I always look up the same um pageson text and always have to click the number . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN But if you could make a new option , that you just have to press one button and you get on your No y Well it's It was just a thought . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but then you have to remember what favourite is what channel . 
UNKNOWN So you might as well remember the number . 
UNKNOWN Or not ? 
UNKNOWN Maybe i maybe it's too complicated , but not sure . 
UNKNOWN It's a good idea , but Uh Uh mayb for me it's If I use my telephone , I never use those buttons to to to call sh Never . 
UNKNOWN So I'm , I u I would find it handy , I think , when you just press one button and you get on six six six . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , okay . 
UNKNOWN But um how can you remember what uh channel uh connects to what favourite button ? 
UNKNOWN Well uh what I was reading on the page. 
UNKNOWN Uh a remote control just sends commands , basics commands to uh the television . 
UNKNOWN So switch to channel six . 
UNKNOWN Yeah ? 
UNKNOWN So uh button six says says six . 
UNKNOWN And if you make favourites , it can say six six six in a row . 
UNKNOWN Just numbers . 
UNKNOWN That can be in the in the Well if you said a favourite Well i Never ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah okay . 
UNKNOWN But uh uh for a user to to remember , if I press that button it goes to that channel . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but isn't it hard to remember ? 
UNKNOWN Like favourite one and Mm as as hard as No , neither do I . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN Oh are you ? 
UNKNOWN So And If I don't do it , maybe old people It's not , it's still not It's not anymore n uh Just on the front as well . 
UNKNOWN Okay now , m maybe not . 
UNKNOWN No , maybe elderly people uh . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I dunno . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN They don't like new features . 
UNKNOWN So maybe not . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um well play , pause . 
UNKNOWN I dunno if that's usable when Not anymore for T_V_ . 
UNKNOWN Right , on off . 
UNKNOWN I dunno , miss Did I miss any other buttons , basic buttons ? 
UNKNOWN Um Forward . 
UNKNOWN I couldn't think of any other , 'specially not for T_V_ . 
UNKNOWN No , that's the only th the only thing you need . 
UNKNOWN Is Just the channel um uh What I mean is uh Six seven eight or five . 
UNKNOWN Uh uh the p uh next and previous . 
UNKNOWN Previous I know , but next channel ? 
UNKNOWN I don't thi Li like a web browser , so Oh , okay . 
UNKNOWN Just very simple . 
UNKNOWN But uh um there's also a button to uh go to the channel you've been before . 
UNKNOWN Like a web browser back button . 
CONFUSION Um I dunno . 
UNKNOWN Uh Yeah , I know what it is , but I think it's all too difficult for old people . 
UNKNOWN I don't have Uh I did Yeah , I don't think you use that . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN Uh It gets some seconds . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , okay . 
UNKNOWN Y only when you want to go to Yeah , just use uh when you wanna switch between channels all the time . 
UNKNOWN And how do you want to uh do it , like if you have a channel above ten ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Normally you can press one , zero or A ten plus or Okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I think um f Especially for older peo elderly people use standard buttons . 
UNKNOWN So you have that uh Yeah , the ten plus button . 
UNKNOWN Just uh one one pressing , or quickly after each other . 
UNKNOWN To just keep it simple and standard uh features . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , w wouldn't it be a problem to uh Because you h have to be fast enough . 
UNKNOWN Maybe the elderly people Oh okay . 
UNKNOWN Uh yeah mayb But I think that's in the T_V_ as well . 
UNKNOWN That's how the uh the T_V_ T_V_ handles it . 
UNKNOWN But you can have a button that says um two two st two stripes . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , it's it's no it's not a It's what Paul says . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So you have uh like a five seconds period to press those two buttons . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but that's th mm Okay . 
UNKNOWN It's not a remote control uh uh that um uh makes the T_V_ um do one two . 
UNKNOWN It's the T_V_ who depends that it must be two seconds or three seconds or one second that you must uh type one or two . 
UNKNOWN So if you have a universal T_V_ controller , you needed one button that has two uh stripes . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So we have a a period of , I dunno , five seconds to press those buttons , and that And not for elderly people to look , one two uh press and aim and So I I don't think so . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But do we still need a two level remote control ? 
UNKNOWN Because if we only have that l only f No . 
UNKNOWN It's only for television now . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN Uh I just thought of another one . 
UNKNOWN Most things in modern T_V_s are also on the menu . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So you also need a menu button . 
UNKNOWN And then uh navigation uh But we can integrate that with volume and previous and next , so you have four arrows . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I I think you ha really have to divide between functions you often use , like um uh m maybe uh switch channels and uh volume and k that kind of things , and uh the menu button . 
UNKNOWN Because you n almost never use menu button . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , okay , but um Yeah , a mute button . 
UNKNOWN So Okay . 
UNKNOWN Maybe it's still still a good idea , I'm not sure . 
UNKNOWN You'll also have to use a mute button to to Maybe , not I don't know where where you have to put it . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN Don't think so . 
UNKNOWN Yeah well , that's that's I think that's the layers that produce . 
UNKNOWN Now I have to figure out what's uh what to put on . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN What we're gonna use . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN That's right . 
UNKNOWN And later we can d uh do the design . 
UNKNOWN Okay , uh now my personal preferences . 
UNKNOWN Uh using the standards , basic Um I think that we should stand out uh unique , being unique with the design . 
UNKNOWN So we have to , I dunno , uh make a different shape than usual . 
UNKNOWN So when you are in the shop and you see our T_V_ controller hanging , that it stands out . 
UNKNOWN Not just in in the row when you see all the same uh remote controls . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Does it have to be Uh it has to be uh with different colours or It's like a iMac or something . 
CONFUSION Um I dunno . 
UNKNOWN Different colours um Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Maybe we can give it out in different colours . 
UNKNOWN You can choose blue or yellow or That's fa That's fancy . 
UNKNOWN Just to make it But it looks cheap as well , because it's a small thing . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Well why not ? 
UNKNOWN Or Yeah . 
UNKNOWN That's uh fashion . 
UNKNOWN It's only twenty five Euros . 
UNKNOWN It looks very cheap if you make it Oh , you just I dunno what happened . 
UNKNOWN Well , maybe you can look at uh mobile phones . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN Who ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , we have to look at mobile phones , that's right . 
UNKNOWN They they're uh designed very well . 
UNKNOWN Just Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And well basically are the same , just a bit smaller . 
UNKNOWN You think you can't make a T_V_ controller too small , 'cause then you will always lo always lose it . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But uh well , I think that's a good example . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Okay , we hurry up a bit , because otherwise we won't make it . 
UNKNOWN Okay , sorry . 
UNKNOWN Well uh Yeah , I I'm finished . 
UNKNOWN Is it fin Are you finished ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN I think we discussed everything . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Well , the working design . 
UNKNOWN The method I used is uh search the web . 
UNKNOWN Just the web pageprovided . 
UNKNOWN Um Basically I'm I'm not very technical uh uh educated , but uh I could figure it out . 
UNKNOWN Um basically what happens is you press a button , uh then a circuit gets closed by pressing the button , uh like a switch . 
UNKNOWN And by closing that certain circuit , the chip knows uh what bu button is pressed . 
UNKNOWN So like you press a one , that circuit is closed and uh Then the chip produces a pattern . 
UNKNOWN Like a Morse code to uh And and sends that to the uh L_E_D_ . 
UNKNOWN That's the uh light emitting diode , I think . 
UNKNOWN Um and the light emitting diode is uh producing infrared light . 
UNKNOWN That's un uh invisible to the human eye . 
UNKNOWN And uh transmit that uh to the T_V_ . 
UNKNOWN However it has also an uh a visible uh diode that's uh blinking red if you look in it . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN And that's uh another diode , I believe . 
UNKNOWN Because infrared is not visible . 
UNKNOWN So that's er uh do two different things but Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So we we also have to have a LED li LED light on it ? 
UNKNOWN I I think so . 
UNKNOWN Uh j Is Ain't it just to to indicate that it's transmitting ? 
UNKNOWN I I'm not sure if it's the same thing . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , it's I think it's usable . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's active . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Or just a green one , because it's If you use it , it's green or the red , it's r green . 
UNKNOWN Maybe uh Maybe depends on uh Yes . 
UNKNOWN I I think it's in the case that it's active . 
UNKNOWN It's not uh I it's it's just uh the the Mm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , when you press it . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's right . 
UNKNOWN But if you Red's l shows up like something's wrong , and green is like it's okay , you press the button . 
UNKNOWN So Two ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I dunno . 
UNKNOWN Ma on on most on most uh uh remote controls it's red . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I know . 
UNKNOWN So So I know . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay , we make it red . 
UNKNOWN But maybe Well we don't have to make it red . 
UNKNOWN Maybe integrate it in the design as well . 
UNKNOWN You have to The whole the whole uh remote control becomes uh green if you press the buttons . 
UNKNOWN Uh that's cool . 
UNKNOWN Uh Oh , maybe it's it is would an e No . 
UNKNOWN I I think uh the batteries will be uh a little Yeah , okay . 
UNKNOWN Just uh Oh . 
UNKNOWN No , we have a recharger in it , so If we can still make that then But it's cool if it was green . 
UNKNOWN Empty . 
UNKNOWN Uh maybe . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but it doesn't have to be red . 
UNKNOWN It's just to indicate something's on . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN That it's working . 
UNKNOWN That it's not not the batteries are low . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It's it's not very important , so yeah . 
UNKNOWN Green or red or whatever , it is cool . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I know . 
UNKNOWN Just to indicate it's working . 
UNKNOWN So mm So we have to uh make buttons for that as well , to make it uh Okay . 
UNKNOWN And uh the receptor in the T_V_ senses the pattern . 
UNKNOWN So we have to understand what patterns are used to , you know , to make it universal . 
UNKNOWN So that it can be used with all the T_V_s . 
UNKNOWN We have to really understand what patterns are used , so we can uh o On the Otherwise it won't work . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN I I uh The chip um uh is producing the pattern . 
UNKNOWN So we have to make a chip that produces patterns to , y you know , to Yeah . 
UNKNOWN An automatically search function for each television , or something . 
UNKNOWN That are working . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , or I dunno how it's uh exactly how it works . 
UNKNOWN It wasn't explained there . 
UNKNOWN Well , I I use a universal uh remote control , and list of all the T_V_s you have , etcetera . 
UNKNOWN Uh I kno Oh , I have a modern one . 
UNKNOWN And you have to put in a number , so it works on your T_V_ . 
UNKNOWN Yeah ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN And the modern one you you uh you type uh search , and the LED began to blink blink blink . 
UNKNOWN And uh uh uh after uh a short time the television turns off . 
UNKNOWN And then you know , oh it it's the right one . 
UNKNOWN And you can stop it , and then it's okay . 
UNKNOWN Ah okay . 
UNKNOWN So you don't have to search for your television or your code . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN It uh search uh the pattern for itself . 
CONFIRMATION Okay , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so we use that . 
UNKNOWN So it uh We have to make a a s a bit more intelligent chip than the standard one . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN Because you have to Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN I just say Can you s just say it again , because I was just looking There's just a short Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh okay . 
UNKNOWN Well uh y you have this chip . 
UNKNOWN That's uh when the circuit is closed , it produces the pattern . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN But uh ma basically for uh brands of T_V_ these patterns are different . 
UNKNOWN So like when you press a one on one T_V_ it go go to one . 
UNKNOWN And on the other T_V_ it won't work , basically . 
UNKNOWN So uh basically what you have to do is uh get these patterns right . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And uh by d uh that can be done by uh just uh cha yeah , changing this pattern all the time . 
UNKNOWN Changing the signal . 
UNKNOWN And um What he's doing when he's configuring this pattern , this chip , uh is trying to switch off the television . 
UNKNOWN And when it's uh switched off , you can push a button as uh it's working now , so And then he saves that setting and then um it's working . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's the right uh option . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Well uh the components . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's a bit technical , and I hadn't I w I was a little short on time . 
UNKNOWN Um but I think I understand it . 
UNKNOWN Um the energy source is uh the battery , basically . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um that's connecting to all the components . 
UNKNOWN Because it has to be fed with energy . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Uh the subcomponent is uh w I I think it is uh the button pressed . 
UNKNOWN So basically when you press a button , a switch get closed . 
UNKNOWN Um that's connecting to a chip . 
UNKNOWN So the chip knows what button you pressed . 
UNKNOWN And the chip sends out uh the pattern to the infrared bulb . 
UNKNOWN I didn didn't put the description by this one . 
UNKNOWN Th this is a normal bulb . 
UNKNOWN So the normal flashing light . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So that's the LED , L_E_D_ . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , and this is a LED too . 
UNKNOWN But this one is producing infrared light that's invisible . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , okay . 
UNKNOWN And this one is producing normal light . 
UNKNOWN So we can make the normal one also a normal light . 
UNKNOWN Not a LED light , but as a normal one . 
UNKNOWN Yeah Yeah , presu Yeah yeah yeah . 
UNKNOWN To flash up your Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh if you if you use the buttons , uh both of them works . 
UNKNOWN But one you can't see and one indicates that you use a button . 
UNKNOWN Because uh when you button press a button and it doesn't work , it can Basically if the battery is low , it won't work . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , and Mm I think it's unnecessary power uh you use then . 
UNKNOWN So you have to indicate that it's Huh , that's a good idea . 
UNKNOWN Maybe you have to uh put uh a small light around the button you push . 
UNKNOWN So you see green if you push that button . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but if you u if you do that , you know that you're uh sending a signal . 
UNKNOWN No , y Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN And it's you also know which button you p Yeah , that's right . 
UNKNOWN But then have to be on the in the all uh remote control have to be LEDs . 
UNKNOWN But it But does it make any difference for the energy you use ? 
UNKNOWN Everywhere in the r Is LEDs uh beneath the the buttons ? 
UNKNOWN You got still one LED . 
UNKNOWN No I don't think so , but Yeah , i it it will look different , and I think we need to find something else . 
UNKNOWN That looks different , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause otherwise we will just make another standard , and our uh motto also is Yeah , w around the buttons , or in the buttons even . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but mm like when you push it n n Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , then then won't Then you won't see it . 
UNKNOWN You have your finger over the button . 
UNKNOWN So you can see Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It must be around it then . 
UNKNOWN Or or m maybe on top of the A green light is flashing or Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , then Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Not not not not here , but here . 
UNKNOWN There . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Maybe uh Okay . 
UNKNOWN The same as a telephone , or a mobile phone , or what do you mean ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , we're thinking about it . 
UNKNOWN Uh on a mobile phone , in the dark uh everything lights up . 
UNKNOWN If you push It lights up . 
UNKNOWN Everything lights up . 
UNKNOWN That's a good idea . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Why ain't that on a remote control ? 
UNKNOWN It it only takes a l a little energy and it's not that much . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , if uh a mobile phone a phone can do it , it's Yeah , i if you're in the dark , you can't see the remote . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It's f Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Maybe that's a good idea for old people as well . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN It's only few LEDs . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Only four or something . 
UNKNOWN Four LED . 
UNKNOWN No , I dunno . 
UNKNOWN But if we use a battery station , which I think we will use Yep . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I uh Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's a good idea , okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN We'll have enough power to Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Everything agre Everyone agrees with that , or Okay . 
UNKNOWN Maybe what Paul said , uh under the on the on the home station , uh a button to uh to call your uh remote control , that it beeps . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , and then you Okay , yeah . 
UNKNOWN And also it's Okay , it shouldn't take much Uh I th I think uh you also have uh remote controls with a lot of options . 
UNKNOWN But you have to make a sound device in it then . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , there must be sound in it . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN But Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I dunno . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN B maybe it's that that's a little too hard to make . 
UNKNOWN Especially for that kind of money . 
UNKNOWN Because it's i it has to be Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Mm uh , twenty five Euros , I think we can make it . 
UNKNOWN Production cost is uh t uh twelve and a half . 
UNKNOWN Bec Twelve and a half , okay . 
UNKNOWN But but we only have to make it for television , and um we must have something special . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , okay . 
UNKNOWN So Uh . 
UNKNOWN But we lose about ninety percent of those options . 
UNKNOWN So I think you can uh Yeah . 
UNKNOWN We have to give our customers some extras . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , okay . 
UNKNOWN I think we will save money with that . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Are you almost finished or just Okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , the the personal preference , I didn't fill it out . 
UNKNOWN Because I was short on time . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN No worry . 
UNKNOWN But um Basically what we could do too is uh have a Bluetooth uh integration . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I just want to talk some about some more . 
UNKNOWN So maybe you have to Yeah ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So this Oh , sorry . 
UNKNOWN Wh what's that ? 
UNKNOWN So uh Oh , sorry . 
UNKNOWN We have some new uh project requirements . 
UNKNOWN We have to have a look what they are . 
UNKNOWN They're still in um Uh teletext has become outdated since the popularity of internet . 
UNKNOWN So a teletext option , maybe we have to skip that one . 
UNKNOWN I'm not sure . 
UNKNOWN I don't think so , but Yeah , and it's it's on your comp it's on your television . 
UNKNOWN No , and I I think a lot of people use uh teletext , still use . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN It's only one button . 
UNKNOWN So I don't think it is We definitely should use it . 
CONFUSION Uh . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um Yeah , that's uh what I told you . 
UNKNOWN The remote control should only be used for a television . 
UNKNOWN So that's maybe easier . 
UNKNOWN And um the the forty plus people , I already told you . 
UNKNOWN Oh no , sorry . 
UNKNOWN Oh , this is a problem . 
UNKNOWN Oh sorry about that . 
UNKNOWN The new product should reach a new market with customers are the younger than forty . 
UNKNOWN So it should be flashy or just more interesting . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN Okay , that's It changes things . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN I'm sorry about that . 
UNKNOWN I just I just didn't read it well . 
UNKNOWN So does it make some decision about that ? 
UNKNOWN Changes . 
UNKNOWN Um Well yeah , then we have to make some nice features . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN That kinda changes the whole situation . 
UNKNOWN Uh L_C_D_ doesn't work for uh twelve and a half Euros I think . 
UNKNOWN I think uh the thing in the dark is a good way , to make it more like a mobile phone . 
UNKNOWN That still stays . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN More modern . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN That's important I think and And I d I don't don't think it's very usable in a remote control , especially when you only have T_V_ functions on it . 
SURPRISE Oh .
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Mm ah I I don't y you'll use it often , because you can see on the television wh what channel you No . 
UNKNOWN So Yeah , I tho I think that's not usable . 
UNKNOWN Oh , I'm watching uh the channel one . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN No , it's not But uh some of you had uh something to read about um uh speech uh recognition . 
UNKNOWN So , but uh Yeah . 
UNKNOWN What other features can we put in ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think you you have to make it a bit flashy and and popular . 
UNKNOWN And uh then the usability is not that required , because the Like in the mobile phones , usability is not that good I think . 
UNKNOWN About you said one and the television turns on one . 
UNKNOWN Is that reachable maybe ? 
UNKNOWN That's very That's fancy . 
UNKNOWN I didn't read I didn't read any b Yeah . 
UNKNOWN That's cool . 
UNKNOWN It's very fashion . 
UNKNOWN Twelve and you've got twelve . 
UNKNOWN Yeah okay . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Only the numbers , only numbers . 
UNKNOWN I I know . 
UNKNOWN Uh furthermore nothing . 
UNKNOWN But only the numbers , one to twenty or something . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN That should be cool . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , maybe we have to integrate that as well . 
UNKNOWN If it's possible . 
UNKNOWN If it's possible , I dunno . 
UNKNOWN But I don't think it's very expensive actually . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I don't know . 
UNKNOWN I didn't read it . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Why should it ? 
UNKNOWN Uh if i if i I didn't have information about that . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I think it's What But uh I dunno how that works then . 
UNKNOWN You only have a microphone in it . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But it has to work . 
UNKNOWN And and and does it have to work only in English , or in Dutch too or And and uh w Yeah ? 
UNKNOWN Nah , maybe Maybe maybe it's too hard to uh to realise that . 
UNKNOWN Ah that's a problem , but Uh only in English . 
UNKNOWN Only in English I think . 
UNKNOWN Uh does your uh Does it lie in the centre of the room and can you scream from wherever uh one to have in channel one ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , it's probably my job to figure that out , but And and do you have to speak in in like in a thing or Yeah , I dunno . 
UNKNOWN No , that Yeah , then th we have to think about that . 
UNKNOWN But do do we do it ? 
UNKNOWN It's more if we if we do it . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I dunno . 
UNKNOWN So , is it very usable ? 
UNKNOWN That's what I'm looking at . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Is Mm Yeah well It's I d Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It We have short time to to put it on the market , so that We have to do a lot of testing before we can do that . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , I think so . 
UNKNOWN We make uh make uh , we can make th th the new remote control very flashy . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , and uh and uh In uh indeed uh the languages are a difficult thing . 
UNKNOWN Uh because we we have a lot of languages . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I don't think it's uh useful enough to take the effort to design something with uh speech recognition . 
UNKNOWN And and Yeah , and also if if you have a good speech uh speech recognition , you can just throw the uh the remote away . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think so . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN A uh someone says that uh give me one Coke , and the T_V_ turns uh to one . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , it's not uh Okay , but th that becomes your f Uh uh because that's very hard for uh speech recognition . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , okay . 
UNKNOWN Well yeah , that's the right command . 
UNKNOWN And then you have to say uh T_V_ channel one , or something . 
UNKNOWN But Hmm yeah , T_V_ one . 
UNKNOWN Not just one , but Well I dunno . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But I don't think , it just ain't useful enough . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So we have to make some decisions . 
UNKNOWN So you can see on the uh So we have to know what we're going to put on . 
UNKNOWN Okay , no speech recognition . 
UNKNOWN Do we , do we make uh a light under the under the n under the numbers and everything ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , I think so . 
UNKNOWN Do If you press something , it lights up for a few seconds , so you can see what other but buttons there are , okay ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's good . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN Okay , we just take that one . 
UNKNOWN And what else , we have Yeah , but it's Oh th I thought would , that that would be the same . 
UNKNOWN Also the one in the dark . 
UNKNOWN So uh It lights up when it's dark ? 
UNKNOWN I didn't Okay . 
UNKNOWN If you push something , it it all lights up . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah yeah , it it mustn't work all the time . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but um Yes , that's what I mean . 
UNKNOWN It uh uh it have to work only when you use it . 
UNKNOWN So if you No , if you use one button , it must turn uh on for twenty seconds , and then it must turn off . 
UNKNOWN Or you can switch it on or something . 
UNKNOWN Or maybe when you yeah . 
UNKNOWN It lights up all . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's right . 
UNKNOWN You have to Yeah , that's right . 
UNKNOWN That's what I said . 
UNKNOWN Okay yeah . 
UNKNOWN It's the same as the telephone . 
UNKNOWN D Yeah , alright . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And do we use a a Uh what's it called ? 
UNKNOWN Like a iMac , if you can look through it . 
UNKNOWN Or just a normal remote control . 
UNKNOWN Maybe just as an option , w like we discussed , like iPod . 
UNKNOWN Mm , maybe it's a good idea . 
UNKNOWN Different colours , uh maybe use even different fonts . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Oh yeah . 
UNKNOWN Like uh phones . 
UNKNOWN Different colours . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so y you just make it th through You look through it ? 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN A see-through . 
UNKNOWN Mm , that's cool . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh as an option maybe . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN And so the buttons we have , this is , yeah , this is normal . 
UNKNOWN We put in the the simple buttons on the top , and probably the the the more complicated buttons down there . 
UNKNOWN It's the standard Yeah , uh Yeah , we but we don't We don't really have any complicated buttons . 
UNKNOWN But you have You had a lot of different buttons . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , maybe you have you have to Uh when you use teletec teletext , you can press a green or a red button to go to the next one , or to go to the previous one . 
UNKNOWN Yeah okay , but Yeah , well w I think the buttons are very easy . 
UNKNOWN With just uh standard buttons we just have so little No , I don't need don't need Uh teletext options are only four buttons or something . 
UNKNOWN O but maybe you can put um the g the options of teletext on the second level of the remote control . 
UNKNOWN Because you ne almost never use it . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but younger people I think um more often use the internet and elderly people often use teletext . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's right . 
UNKNOWN So uh Hmm . 
UNKNOWN I use teletext as well . 
UNKNOWN No , I use te teletext every day , I think . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN For me too , it is . 
UNKNOWN So we just keep it one level then ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah yeah , one level . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN And I think , uh 'cause um we don't have that many buttons , I think the design is most important . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN You can d uh integrate the buttons in the design very much . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause simple buttons . 
UNKNOWN If you put one above it , it's clear . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So that's it for toda for We're going to have a lunch lunch break . 
UNKNOWN Um So yeah , you know what you have to do . 
UNKNOWN How long is lunch break ? 
UNKNOWN This is uh this is it . 
UNKNOWN You get your meal and everything , so Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Trendwatching . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION That's fine . 
UNKNOWN Yo . 
UNKNOWN So , we're finished for t for this time . 
UNKNOWN We're going to have some lunch . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
FAREWELL Bye . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFUSION Uh . 
UNKNOWN Bonjour . 
UNKNOWN It's It won't wake up . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I was a bit early . 
UNKNOWN Like What ? 
UNKNOWN Why ? 
UNKNOWN No , I just came in . 
UNKNOWN Uh normally I was one of them . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Come on . 
UNKNOWN Check check check check . 
GREETING Hello . 
UNKNOWN Why won't it wake up ? 
UNKNOWN Oop . 
UNKNOWN Is it on ? 
UNKNOWN The power light doesn't work . 
UNKNOWN You turned it off . 
UNKNOWN But how ? 
UNKNOWN Ah , there it is . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFUSION Uh . 
UNKNOWN I received an emailwith uh a few possibilities on uh the materials . 
UNKNOWN So I'll discuss them with you . 
UNKNOWN Okay , we're just going to the later . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I received an emailas well . 
UNKNOWN So we're going to talk about the conceptual model . 
SURPRISE Oh .
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Which one was mine ? 
UNKNOWN So that's me . 
UNKNOWN Uh okay . 
UNKNOWN So Uh okay . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so I just show you the m the no mm mm the the the the the the minutes, minute. 
UNKNOWN What's it called , I dunno . 
UNKNOWN Whatever . 
UNKNOWN The minutes. 
UNKNOWN Okay , so we just talked about uh Oh you want me to show that there or Okay , we just talked about it looks . 
UNKNOWN Uh Shall I start ? 
UNKNOWN No , just tell us . 
UNKNOWN Mm no . 
UNKNOWN Has to look nice . 
UNKNOWN Usability is very important . 
UNKNOWN People don't want to spend money on something that's similar to cheaper ones . 
UNKNOWN Um It has to be very basic , not too many buttons . 
UNKNOWN Light switches on if you use a button . 
UNKNOWN Uh text T_V_ still has to be a possibility . 
UNKNOWN And it has to be easy to learn . 
UNKNOWN That were the things I uh make minutesof . 
UNKNOWN And the functions are volume , channel to choose channels , an on-off , a mute uh button , and a text T_V_ button . 
UNKNOWN That are the functions . 
UNKNOWN That right ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So I just want to give you uh Mike again , the first uh presentationof your Yeah . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN Okay well I received an emailOkay . 
UNKNOWN I searched the web , uh and uh I searched uh on this d document, recent investigation of the remote control market . 
UNKNOWN It has been done in Italy uh Italy and in uh another country in Europe , I forget it . 
UNKNOWN Uh but uh they found out the most important aspect for remote controls happens to be a fancy look-and-feel , instead of the current functional look and feel . 
UNKNOWN So it's very important for us to create something new . 
UNKNOWN So what Michael just said , it must be uh some very different from ordinary uh remote controls . 
UNKNOWN Fancy stands for an original look-and-feel of the case and interface . 
UNKNOWN Uh this uh aspect is the most important one . 
UNKNOWN Uh it came out of the research . 
UNKNOWN It uh is twice important as the following . 
UNKNOWN The second uh most important aspect is that a remote control should it uh technological innovative . 
UNKNOWN Uh that stands for uh uh new technical uh features . 
UNKNOWN And then uh that uh This is a point of discussion , because we just decided that we don't make use of uh L_C_D_ or uh speech recognition . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN But um this is the second uh important uh aspect , and I think uh we must use some of the new technology , to be uh innovative . 
UNKNOWN But we already have the flashing flashing light on the Okay . 
UNKNOWN Uh maybe maybe something new . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , more . 
UNKNOWN We have to discuss about it s uh Okay , uh features not uh do not exist in current remote controls . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Well , I'll I'll get back on it . 
UNKNOWN And that's very hard I think . 
UNKNOWN Uh the third one is the aspect of the remote control should be easy to use . 
UNKNOWN But uh that was an overall uh point . 
UNKNOWN We already discussed that . 
UNKNOWN Um I've got one picture . 
UNKNOWN Uh d our our target group uh we thought about was young and trendy . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So I took uh that part of the webpage . 
UNKNOWN And it says uh fashion-watchers of uh uh Pari uh France and uh Italy , yeah , uh have detected the following trends . 
UNKNOWN This trends I th uh trend I think it's not um that meaningful for us , maybe . 
UNKNOWN But it's about uh clothes and shoes . 
UNKNOWN But the uh the next uh aspect also in contrast to last year , the feel of material is expe uh uh is expected to be spongy . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Spongy . 
UNKNOWN But spongy , what what does spongy says ? 
UNKNOWN Spongy . 
UNKNOWN Spongy , like sponge . 
UNKNOWN Spongy . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So rubber , kind of . 
UNKNOWN Uh soft materials . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But maybe th that's al definitely a good idea , because you've you're you drop y your remote control very often on the ground . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So it has to be flexible . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , it's something that uh it stand there . 
UNKNOWN But I didn't knew uh knew what it means . 
UNKNOWN So spongy means y Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It's like a sponge . 
UNKNOWN Soft , sponge . 
UNKNOWN So it's also a stress-ball . 
UNKNOWN That's a good That's a good idea . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , somewhat like Yeah , I've some uh material uh information , but I'll give you it later in my presentation. 
UNKNOWN If it's de like that . 
UNKNOWN That's good , a good idea . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but Yeah . 
UNKNOWN How are you gonna make it ? 
UNKNOWN Is it a bit like like the the the the remote control ? 
UNKNOWN R_ soft . 
UNKNOWN Uh Okay ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN What do I think ? 
UNKNOWN Uh because a fancy look is the most important thing uh for remote control uh control , I think about changeable fronts . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh maybe a see-through one in a a fruit front . 
UNKNOWN Because it's uh it's hot . 
UNKNOWN And uh some basic uh colour fronts . 
UNKNOWN Uh so we can make uh five different fronts to start with or something . 
UNKNOWN Uh maybe an extraordinary shape , like a sponge . 
UNKNOWN Uh or uh , yeah , just another shape than a normal uh remote control ha uh has . 
UNKNOWN Just uh something round in it , or uh maybe not uh not uh Yeah , I dun dunno . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN We have to discuss about that . 
UNKNOWN Uh y yeah . 
UNKNOWN Main point uh still uh is the technolo technological innovative . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , how do we do that ? 
UNKNOWN Maybe speech ? 
UNKNOWN We ma must have some kind of gadget . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I'll get back on that . 
UNKNOWN So Intro Yeah . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN It's very uh difficult to to to do it . 
UNKNOWN Because it's only twelve and a half Euros you have to spend on every remote control . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's the problem . 
UNKNOWN Well , I got f also an emailfrom the the technology department . 
UNKNOWN That's the main problem . 
UNKNOWN So Maybe we watch the first uh the next two presentations. 
UNKNOWN They have done uh research about it , and uh even more possibilities now with speech . 
UNKNOWN So they recommended using it . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Well I'll check what they exact mean . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Uh let's first watch Paul's presentationfirst then . 
UNKNOWN So uh Yeah , th that's the only problem . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , well actually we have don't have an idea how much it's gonna cost . 
UNKNOWN But maybe it's cheap and it's easy to implement . 
UNKNOWN I d They don't say how much it will cost , so Um but uh if we implement uh speech recognition , I think it would be better to implement L_C_D_ as well . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN It's mass production . 
UNKNOWN So you can say , you can Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Since you have to uh configure speech thing . 
UNKNOWN But that's definitely more expensive than Yeah , but a telephone Okay , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's that's something I dunno . 
UNKNOWN But how uh we we're gonna make many of those . 
UNKNOWN So we can start a mass production , and then the cost will still will be . 
UNKNOWN But a telephone also have a L_C_D_ and and it's about t two hundred Euros . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , so uh we gotta de We have to decide on that . 
UNKNOWN So uh Yeah , just modern modern but still uh basic . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN That was this ? 
UNKNOWN Mm uh L_D_C_ doesn't require Okay . 
UNKNOWN Oh I got an emailuh And it says uh the chip can be uh simple , regular or advanced . 
UNKNOWN And Um They say uh a display requires an advanced chip . 
UNKNOWN And this is more expensive than all the other chips . 
UNKNOWN So it's m the most expensive . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , it says in the email. 
UNKNOWN The display requires an advanced chip . 
UNKNOWN And speech recognition ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , probably too . 
UNKNOWN Advanced . 
UNKNOWN I I haven't got anything about speech recognition , but Well it d That's that's the most expensive chip , we need . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I'll I'll give you my design . 
UNKNOWN If we're doing uh if we're doing a display . 
UNKNOWN Yeah okay . 
UNKNOWN So we Well we can I had uh to make a sort of a design . 
UNKNOWN So I did some searching on the internet . 
UNKNOWN I watched the old remote controls and news com remote como uh remote controls . 
UNKNOWN I think we should um This is one of the modern remote controls of the moment . 
UNKNOWN I think we should go more to the iPod and M_P_ three players . 
UNKNOWN Mobile phones . 
UNKNOWN More modern . 
UNKNOWN Y yes . 
UNKNOWN Um you probably have to make it a bit bigger and a bit smaller . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause remote con control , you can see it here , you have to bo reach both out both sides . 
UNKNOWN And here you just have one , few buttons . 
UNKNOWN So that's that's the main difference . 
UNKNOWN But looks uh I definitely think we should go like this . 
UNKNOWN And then changeable fonts , so It's the most important part , I think . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN But And the home base is something like that , something simple . 
UNKNOWN Well and then I just ordered the the buttons a bit . 
UNKNOWN Uh basic buttons . 
UNKNOWN On-off , mute . 
UNKNOWN And th maybe two others , I dunno . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , maybe the teletext tel No . 
UNKNOWN Text buttons . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , text button , maybe there and there . 
UNKNOWN And then the colour buttons , if we want it on . 
UNKNOWN I don't find it very usable , but it's Uh I don't think it's fits in the the modern theme as well . 
UNKNOWN No , I don't uh I don't like it . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN So and then yeah we saw the the pla display , in the the iPod . 
UNKNOWN They can put the basic buttons , one , two , three , four . 
UNKNOWN And uh f above ten . 
UNKNOWN And I think No no . 
UNKNOWN But it That's on on the display . 
UNKNOWN That th there is no display there . 
UNKNOWN But it's on the place of the display . 
UNKNOWN And I think we should uh light this up much more than that part . 
UNKNOWN So the focus is on these two parts . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So you don't see all the buttons you else need . 
UNKNOWN But it sounds very difficult to use . 
UNKNOWN Because um the volume and channel is on the on the the bottom of it . 
UNKNOWN Uh well um This is how it is now . 
UNKNOWN So you can't use your thumb for it . 
UNKNOWN Um Here uh Well we have volume . 
UNKNOWN I think it is on uh on the bottom too . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , down there . 
UNKNOWN But it's not not the best best . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well here we have also side scrolls . 
UNKNOWN I dunno if we can use that . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , for volume . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I've I've got something of that uh too . 
UNKNOWN Do we want to use For volume ? 
UNKNOWN For volume , or a channel . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , why not . 
UNKNOWN Well then we can even simplify it more . 
UNKNOWN Scroll . 
UNKNOWN By just putting the volume on the side . 
UNKNOWN And and just channel buttons here . 
UNKNOWN And the channels as well . 
UNKNOWN Oh yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , or uh maybe uh The channel buttons are often used . 
UNKNOWN But I think uh Well . 
UNKNOWN And you can't use them now with your thumb , because the thing is not , it's not easy to control . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , well it's Basically it's it's here . 
UNKNOWN Yeah okay , m maybe we cho should put that on top , and buttons we we don't use on , in the bottom . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's better . 
UNKNOWN They're on top ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , just th th th other buttons like text T_V_ . 
UNKNOWN Put that on the button bottom . 
UNKNOWN Because uh you can't hold it . 
UNKNOWN You mean uh these to the low ? 
UNKNOWN You can't hold it th the control and push the buttons . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Except from the on-off button . 
UNKNOWN Oh okay . 
UNKNOWN Well , yeah . 
UNKNOWN But I I think w you'll use uh the switch channels buttons uh more often than the normal uh channel buttons , like one two three . 
UNKNOWN So maybe we can put that on the bottom . 
UNKNOWN Mm Maybe . 
UNKNOWN I dunno , but yeah we'll Yeah , maybe it's not easy if it's below . 
UNKNOWN Like zapping is just switching one channel at a time . 
UNKNOWN It's harder to zap . 
UNKNOWN So I think uh it should be should be easy to . 
UNKNOWN I think it's pretty standard , these rubber buttons on the top . 
UNKNOWN Yeah okay . 
UNKNOWN That's that's good , but Yeah okay . 
UNKNOWN And uh if you don't light 'em up , they don't uh you don't see 'em very good . 
UNKNOWN I think it's modern to light this area up , and to light this area up . 
UNKNOWN So the focus gets on these parts and not on there . 
UNKNOWN But uh the position of course can be different . 
UNKNOWN It's s We have to look uh what's easy to use , and how it's easier to use . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So we can uh switch these to I dunno if it l will look good , if you put those on t on the bottom half . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN No , I think th the the top buttons are okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN They sh Those should be on top . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , maybe Those two , yeah . 
UNKNOWN But uh we we can switch those two , yeah . 
UNKNOWN And uh , yeah , you have to make sure it's easy to uh Yes , it has to be big enough so you can hold it , right . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Well that's that's my findings . 
UNKNOWN So uh my personal opinion is that we should go more modern look . 
UNKNOWN M_P_ three player . 
UNKNOWN And uh well um if we want to put in speech rec recognition or something , we I don't think we should put it on top then . 
UNKNOWN I think that , if we're gonna put in more technology , that you need to be able to uh switch it open . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN To use So if you put in uh speech recognition , you need so more uh many more buttons . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's cool . 
UNKNOWN Which won't look good on the front side I think . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN So that's something we have to decide on . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , we have to keep it simple . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN We have to decide this this lecture , or this this this uh fifty minutes , yeah , how it is gonna look . 
UNKNOWN What we're gonna do . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Okay , the component design . 
UNKNOWN I looked at uh some similar devices , and uh my own common knowledge . 
UNKNOWN So uh this was on the web site . 
UNKNOWN If you aim at a young public , you should use materials that are soft with primary colours like green , blue , red . 
UNKNOWN So flashy kinda colours . 
UNKNOWN Uh shapes should be curved , so round shapes . 
UNKNOWN Not Nothing square-like . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so Hmm , okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah well uh iPod is trendy . 
UNKNOWN And it is well curved square . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Square . 
UNKNOWN Like . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but mm is uh has round corners I think . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So not Yeah okay . 
UNKNOWN So we shouldn't have too square corners and that kind of thing . 
UNKNOWN Not uh the old uh box look . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And um sports and gaming device style characteristics . 
UNKNOWN I don't know exactly what that means , but it should be , well yeah , popular kind of looking , I think . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , we have to put our Real Reaction logo as well on the on the remote control . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Mm Yeah , it's Black yellow control . 
UNKNOWN So the colours also . 
UNKNOWN So we have ha to ma make it in black , black , yellow . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Maybe the sides in yellow and the the the top in black . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , mm n Not that weird , because we definitely want to make it kind of flashy , to attract a young public . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but uh I don't think the the colours black and yellow go well together . 
UNKNOWN But Yeah , okay . 
UNKNOWN No , okay . 
UNKNOWN We make i Maybe you can put yellow on the side and black on the on the front . 
UNKNOWN That's a that's a sen That's just a matter of tastes , but We have to use uh kind of flashy colours , I think . 
UNKNOWN Uh can't we use um different uh fron uh fronts , with all with the the logo on it ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , it's cool . 
UNKNOWN Can we do that ? 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN Like fronts in in red and yellow and blue and Okay . 
UNKNOWN So Yes . 
UNKNOWN And still trans Still still transparent . 
UNKNOWN Oh yeah . 
UNKNOWN So Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But with all with logo on it . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Well this is a remote control , a very old one . 
UNKNOWN Um Then the components . 
UNKNOWN The case has just a Here's black . 
UNKNOWN But we are making it uh Yeah , I dunno . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , we make it som Maybe we have to make it from soft material . 
UNKNOWN Uh I'm not sure . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Maybe . 
UNKNOWN But anyways uh it should be transparent . 
UNKNOWN We decided that , huh ? 
UNKNOWN Well one of the options . 
UNKNOWN S Okay . 
UNKNOWN You can Just like a mobile phone , you can make um different fronts on it . 
UNKNOWN So you can just replace them I think . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , we could do that . 
UNKNOWN That was the idea , or just uh release one . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Just give five with them , just in a box . 
UNKNOWN Five different Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , uh Or just uh sell different ones . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but y you could you could make 'em uh uh like blue and transparent . 
UNKNOWN So you can still th look through it . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Cool . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um the buttons . 
UNKNOWN Normal rubber I think . 
UNKNOWN Like normal ordinary buttons . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I uh I dunno . 
UNKNOWN Soft . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN A more Yeah , just uh I think uh rubber really has an odd look . 
UNKNOWN It it could be like a Nokia , like plastic . 
UNKNOWN Uh uh Yeah . 
UNKNOWN With the hard hard buttons . 
UNKNOWN That's better prob Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN The the the new uh new modern uh remote controls , uh the buttons are part of the uh the style , I think is part of the remote control itself . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It it's one uh a one uh out of one shape . 
UNKNOWN Uh it's n doesn't Is uh a button uh um How do you say it ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , it's it's all on one level . 
UNKNOWN It it didn't it i it don't come out of the on the background . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , on one level . 
UNKNOWN It is in uh the c a remote control uh Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I know what you mean . 
UNKNOWN So we have to keep it on the one level . 
UNKNOWN Like th the top it's Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , like mobile phones . 
UNKNOWN Like uh the iPod . 
UNKNOWN Uh just I dunno what uh kind of material it is . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , okay . 
UNKNOWN Okay , it's chos So that should be hard plastic . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's cool . 
UNKNOWN Then the buttons ? 
UNKNOWN I think . 
UNKNOWN Or maybe Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But Oops . 
UNKNOWN But maybe you can m make a uh round fluff or soft material . 
UNKNOWN Just only the basic uh basic remote control from normal plastic , and the rounds of it from softer s I dunno . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And um Then the L_E_D_ . 
UNKNOWN The normal infrared L_E_D_ I think s sufficient . 
UNKNOWN And back light L_E_D_s . 
UNKNOWN Y Cool . 
UNKNOWN So But I think we have to make the case transparent , otherwise the back light won't work . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So if you put Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh you can just make them around the buttons uh Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Y i if you The numbers could be can be Yeah , that's right . 
UNKNOWN Or it runs the whole Yeah , you can halfs transparent , or just that it's comes out a bit . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but we can still make it transparent . 
UNKNOWN So Or no Yeah okay . 
UNKNOWN They can choose . 
UNKNOWN Good . 
UNKNOWN And in green colour , the back lights or Yeah ? 
UNKNOWN Different , I think , also . 
UNKNOWN Blue . 
UNKNOWN Blue or red . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Whatever you want it , I think . 
UNKNOWN Uh depends on the colour of the Yeah , that's true . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but you can't choo You can't choose it when you buy it . 
UNKNOWN Uh i Yeah , but can you change it if you already bought the the remote control ? 
UNKNOWN You have to choose Is it Okay . 
UNKNOWN But Yeah , it can . 
UNKNOWN No , but I think there are multiple colour LEDs . 
UNKNOWN So I I know I dunno . 
UNKNOWN Is Maybe it's it's more impor more expensive . 
UNKNOWN You Hmm . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause this a mo mib uh mobile phone as well . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , okay . 
UNKNOWN Maybe put some different ones in it . 
UNKNOWN Doesn't matter . 
UNKNOWN I think it's Yeah , I dunno . 
UNKNOWN It's just No , just some LED . 
UNKNOWN I have the mo mi I have a blinking light on my phone . 
UNKNOWN And I can change the colour of it . 
CONFIRMATION Okay , cool . 
UNKNOWN Just make it some different colours . 
UNKNOWN Blue , red and green , or something . 
UNKNOWN Maybe it's too expensive , but it I th I don't think so . 
UNKNOWN Well , we don't put put in any fancier technology yet . 
UNKNOWN So I'm sure we can fit in . 
UNKNOWN Then uh some more technical things . 
UNKNOWN I don't know what it is , but it should be there I think . 
UNKNOWN Um this is the normal circuit board , like a chip board in in a lot of uh things . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , we have to hurry up a bit , so Okay . 
UNKNOWN W So we d we just need this and this transistors and resonators . 
UNKNOWN There's all these kind of things . 
UNKNOWN Um they they basically said that that's almost the same on any uh remote controls . 
UNKNOWN So I guess we j we just need that . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I don't know what they do or Nah , but they just said we need it . 
UNKNOWN Okay yeah , you can you can change Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah okay . 
UNKNOWN We just Yeah , we have to make sure to uh Yes . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN Uh the battery contacts , like normal batteries ca you can put in . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , a recharger maybe . 
UNKNOWN Yeah okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah but Yeah , but it i We don't wanna have a ar an How do you call it ? 
UNKNOWN We still want to have a recharger , don't we ? 
UNKNOWN Is that still the A recha Oh no . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN Accu . 
UNKNOWN Re recharger . 
UNKNOWN Y uh just just batteries , rechargeable batteries . 
UNKNOWN Uh Battery . 
UNKNOWN Base station . 
UNKNOWN It's just a battery . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , batteries . 
UNKNOWN Yes , rechargeable batteries , I think's best . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Not a separate Okay . 
UNKNOWN No , just rechargeable batteries . 
UNKNOWN And uh a chip , that's this one . 
UNKNOWN Then uh I received some possibilities . 
UNKNOWN Um for the energy source we can use batteries or a kinetic uh Like with the pulse watch . 
UNKNOWN So it operates on your wrist kinda . 
UNKNOWN Ah cool . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So if you hold it , it gets powered . 
UNKNOWN If you hold it . 
UNKNOWN But normally you put a remote control on the table or on the couch . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I don't think it will work , and Or we can also use solar cells . 
UNKNOWN But you mostly use it indoors , so Yeah , and and we can use the home station kind of thing . 
UNKNOWN It's dark in the room . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN It's just batteries , that's cheaper . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um cases , flat , so uncurved . 
UNKNOWN Uh two D_ curved is um like front to the back . 
UNKNOWN And three D_ curved is also in depth . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So that's possible . 
UNKNOWN Uh but with three D_ uh curved uh remote controls , we must use rubber buttons . 
UNKNOWN So we can't use the flat buttons . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN So we need uh two D_ . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I think . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Definitely . 
UNKNOWN Um these kinda materials can be used . 
UNKNOWN But it doesn't really matter , we just make it plastic . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I think so too . 
UNKNOWN The scroll wheels , that's cool . 
UNKNOWN That's for the volume . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , scroll wheels um Yeah , that's good . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN We can use multiple scroll wheels , w if we want to . 
UNKNOWN But I think just the volume is enough . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh For channels it's not handy , because you scroll too fast . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN And uh the L_C_D_ . 
UNKNOWN So we need uh the expensive , most expensive chip , if we use an L_C_D_ . 
UNKNOWN Mm Uh but we have to do something about the trend . 
UNKNOWN I don't think that's an opportunity . 
UNKNOWN Just skip it . 
UNKNOWN Because we don't have time for that to to put it in . 
UNKNOWN Okay , then we we use m must use the second most expensive chip . 
UNKNOWN So th so the regular chip . 
UNKNOWN Because we use scroll wheels . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN And um Yeah , that was it I guess . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Uh are are we using a a rubber case , or We haven't decided yet . 
UNKNOWN Oh just sk Maybe you have to skip that one as well . 
UNKNOWN It's No . 
UNKNOWN Uh I don't think a rubber case looks Yeah , okay . 
UNKNOWN L Yeah , i it it should be soft . 
UNKNOWN You said so ? 
UNKNOWN The trend is uh spong spongy uh and uh fruit or fresh fresh . 
UNKNOWN That Uh fruit and veg , or Yeah , fruit and veg can be just the covers . 
UNKNOWN And uh now we have nothing about uh about those those two . 
UNKNOWN Uh yeah i Just Just on front . 
UNKNOWN So you can the the spongy yeah , I dunno . 
UNKNOWN I can't imagine a soft remote control . 
UNKNOWN Neith uh I don't like it uh neither . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN I just can't imagine it . 
UNKNOWN So just hard plastic ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I think . 
UNKNOWN Titanium . 
UNKNOWN It's mentioned here uh . 
UNKNOWN Titanium , uh I think it's too expensive . 
UNKNOWN But maybe the form has to be a bit different . 
UNKNOWN Not the sh the square form . 
UNKNOWN Just a bit more rounded . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , you can make it curved or mm round . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But just in two D_ , not in depth . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's right . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So We have to decide which one we're going to choose from these . 
UNKNOWN What exactly . 
UNKNOWN Because we have to know it . 
UNKNOWN So the energy uh is the recharger . 
UNKNOWN We already know that . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Just a normal battery . 
UNKNOWN We have batteries . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN The chip-on-print is a normal one . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Regular . 
UNKNOWN Okay , the case is just a plastic one . 
UNKNOWN Yeah th yeah , the chip is the the regular one . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , re Yeah , regular . 
UNKNOWN You have the simple one , regular and advanced . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , okay . 
UNKNOWN So it's b should be regular uh the second . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , regular . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN I think I'll just check it . 
UNKNOWN And we need a plastic case , with a scroll wheel . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN That's pretty much it . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN User interface concept . 
UNKNOWN And a flashy light . 
UNKNOWN So uh I'm not sure . 
UNKNOWN But we do I don't know if we expected to drawon this one at this moment . 
UNKNOWN But Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I dunno either . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Or should we do it in the next meeting ? 
UNKNOWN Uh I_D_ and U_I_D_ work together on prototype drawingon smart board . 
UNKNOWN So we should did it here ? 
UNKNOWN That's for the next one . 
UNKNOWN So we're staying here ? 
UNKNOWN That's for th Uh that I think that's the next next meeting . 
UNKNOWN Or should we do it in the next meeting ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN But you definitely get a specific instruction . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so now we're ka thirty minutes alone again ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But th think about something that's more rounded . 
UNKNOWN Just And more It has to be Uh a bit . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , uh I dunno . 
UNKNOWN But the iPod and etcetera , M_P_ three players , mobile phones . 
UNKNOWN Just just on the top or on the bottom . 
UNKNOWN Just a bit cur Okay , I'll see if I can see any of those . 
UNKNOWN Maybe the wheel can be uh like uh like this . 
UNKNOWN O um if you drawit like this , you get a What the fuck is it ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Mm Doesn't work . 
UNKNOWN You see what I mean ? 
UNKNOWN If I drawhere It draws about four centimetres lower than Nah okay . 
UNKNOWN What ? 
SURPRISE Oh .
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Just . 
UNKNOWN Maybe you can make it like this . 
UNKNOWN And this is all the wheel for volume . 
UNKNOWN So that you just um It's all rounded , so you can do uh turn this one . 
UNKNOWN Like a very big scroll-wheel . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but just not on the top , but uh on the side of it . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Maybe , I dunno . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so we have this at the moment . 
UNKNOWN I think uh you'll get a a lot of uh volume changing when it's not wanted . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , you Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so we'd have this . 
UNKNOWN Is that okay ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's a little problem , of course , as well . 
UNKNOWN I think it's probably better . 
UNKNOWN And Like this . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but maybe we can make a a plastic , so that you i if you like drop it , it won't change the volume . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , maybe you just have to make it uh That's not scrollable too easy . 
UNKNOWN Only if you use your finger . 
UNKNOWN And uh what's the channel choose ? 
UNKNOWN Where do we uh put that ? 
UNKNOWN I think in middle . 
UNKNOWN Still on the bottom or That's the numbers . 
UNKNOWN Uh wh what is the middle part ? 
UNKNOWN Uh I think th the numbers should be in the bottom , and and the switch channel in the middle . 
UNKNOWN Numbers , okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I agree as well . 
UNKNOWN Use the dz Yeah , that's right . 
UNKNOWN It doesn't make a difference , if you put the s uh the switch channels on side of each other or on top of each other . 
UNKNOWN Because you already have the volume here , so You can also put it here one butt and the other one there . 
UNKNOWN Next to each other . 
UNKNOWN back and forth . 
UNKNOWN So you can also can put it all on the top , and this , you keep this empty . 
UNKNOWN Because you have to hold it as well . 
UNKNOWN Or you could do the switch channel up button above the the numbers and switch channel down button below . 
UNKNOWN But that's not want to zap very quick , so Yeah ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I think uh zapping is the highest priority . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , okay . 
UNKNOWN And then you use those uh Yeah , of course uh . 
UNKNOWN Is this a opportunity , or you don't want a different Why ? 
UNKNOWN Uh but I think we we should bu uh put 'em on top of each other , so Because then it's it's easy to know m if I push the the the up Yeah , but the top the top button is is like you switch channel up , and down button is If you put them But uh but I I think uh left to right is more often associated with volume , and top down is more with uh channel changing . 
UNKNOWN But still the next It's still the next one . 
UNKNOWN Doesn't make Yeah , but fo from left to right is exactly the same . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It ma it doesn't make a big difference . 
UNKNOWN I I think it's It's it's obvious , I think . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's not not It's not al uh always the same . 
UNKNOWN But it's exactly th I dunno . 
UNKNOWN In uh On most on most remote controls . 
UNKNOWN Every remote control's uh different . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I think No , uh I think Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So so if we use that , they will probably have a long learning uh time . 
UNKNOWN I You already have the volume on the side , so you can't make it you can't ma make a mistake . 
UNKNOWN So it's uh So but that's for that's for you , 'cause it's Okay , so hmm . 
UNKNOWN I think it's s so simple you just Yeah , okay I'll d I'll take a look at it . 
UNKNOWN I dunno . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN What did What else we have to discuss about ? 
UNKNOWN I dunno . 
UNKNOWN Think we need to work uh thirty minutes again ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , we have to care that it r uh looks really new . 
UNKNOWN Because uh we still hold on to the uh ordinary uh uh square uh remote control . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause wha what I see the only difference i i i in fact is that we use a scroll-wheel on the outside . 
UNKNOWN And the LED . 
UNKNOWN No , you have uh It is Uh the current uh controllers are all black and plastic . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but i i it should be round in in shape . 
UNKNOWN So No , tha that will be Yeah , so top down . 
UNKNOWN You have to look at that image of the iPod . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN More that uh kind of style . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN And a bit uh Some some kind of bling bling uh mm can we have Uh and how many uh fronts uh fronts do we put on the market then ? 
UNKNOWN Not not the old grey black Where you can put a ve Uh we have If we do it like that we have below have we uh a lot of room to put a nice logo . 
UNKNOWN Uh Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh the logo was has to be on there . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's right . 
UNKNOWN Uh five or something ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , five . 
UNKNOWN Or more or And um uh uh buy the product . 
UNKNOWN Let's give five . 
UNKNOWN Maybe you can buy separate ones and uh Yeah . 
UNKNOWN You buy , you get one . 
UNKNOWN And uh basic . 
UNKNOWN Or you can choose one uh if you buy the project . 
UNKNOWN Um I think Yeah . 
UNKNOWN That's your choice , I think huh . 
UNKNOWN So y you can put the bottom of the remote control in recharger ? 
UNKNOWN Is that is that a good good opportunity ? 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN So you could put it like that , okay . 
UNKNOWN Hmm ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , you sl uh you let it slidein the docking station . 
UNKNOWN Do we have to design that w as well ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh I'm not sure . 
UNKNOWN The docking station ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , I think so . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , we can b It c it could be just just a square , just a packet . 
UNKNOWN But th Yeah , that can be very simple . 
UNKNOWN Least . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , just a recharger . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , just where you're around something . 
UNKNOWN Li Yeah , we had one example . 
UNKNOWN But we have to make contacts on the on the remote control and the recharger as well . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but that's a round one . 
UNKNOWN Which w Here you see one that's very round . 
UNKNOWN Maybe we can choose then . 
UNKNOWN Oh yeah , okay . 
UNKNOWN So I think that can be all kind of shapes . 
UNKNOWN But maybe you can just round up the corners a bit . 
UNKNOWN Of the remote control ? 
UNKNOWN That's all . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Just round it up . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , so y you don't want uh this uh like the iPod . 
UNKNOWN But More rounded . 
NEGATION No . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I think it will just look like more like this one . 
UNKNOWN Since it's This is also rounded . 
UNKNOWN No , just just the corners . 
UNKNOWN I think i Yeah okay , tho those are al already a bit cornered . 
UNKNOWN Mm Yeah okay , but then we have to think of something totally new . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but we can we can do all kinds of uh As long as it isn is in two D_ we can use all kind of round shapes . 
UNKNOWN Shapes . 
UNKNOWN Not in depth . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but Yeah , if if we want to make it kind of , yeah , new . 
UNKNOWN I've uh I had a lot of picture of old ones . 
UNKNOWN And all curves have already been done . 
UNKNOWN It's a bit annoying , isn't it ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN What do we do wrong ? 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Just just more like this and not uh a square . 
UNKNOWN Yeah okay , yeah well Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but we could do a lot of , lot more curving . 
UNKNOWN I would do it Like in this kind of shape or I dunno . 
UNKNOWN I know we can do a lot more , but I think it will only look more like the old remote controls . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , it Uh it's very annoying . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN I dunno if it's handy . 
UNKNOWN Uh Yeah . 
UNKNOWN This ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN The olden the olden ones had looked like just a square thing . 
UNKNOWN Yeah okay . 
UNKNOWN But uh I had a lot of pictures Oh I can show you here what the old ones look like . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Curves , curves . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN You've more there as well . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , okay . 
UNKNOWN It wasn't very small one . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN very simple . 
UNKNOWN That is for elderly . 
UNKNOWN So we have to make a decision , what kind of form it's gonna have t going to have . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I don't know . 
UNKNOWN I think if w My opinion . 
UNKNOWN If we just uh take the iPod , and the same look . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So uh light or just whatever colour , but the same light colours . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN And uh just with uh together with uh the back-lights b look will look very new . 
UNKNOWN No rubber buttons or something . 
UNKNOWN Just together with the back-lights you'll get a totally new look . 
UNKNOWN More like the M_P_ three player M_ um P_ M_ P_ three player . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And you have the scroll button inside . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Just a simple scrollb Doesn't have to be . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But why do we have to round it on the t bottom then ? 
UNKNOWN Of Skip that one as well . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , it's cool . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , though that's a trend . 
UNKNOWN If we want to make it . 
UNKNOWN But yeah , I'm not a Trendwatcher , you are . 
UNKNOWN So Spongeball kinda . 
UNKNOWN Uh the t the trend is spongy and fruity . 
UNKNOWN Rubber spongy . 
UNKNOWN But yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN Spongy and Mm . 
UNKNOWN It's not not a lot of trends I uh I found uh Uh It The th th Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so we have s still one minute left . 
UNKNOWN So just I think it's okay if you just keep it a bit square . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I d I don't know n something about ergonomic kind of fits-in-the-hand uh stuff . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN But I I think it's still for older people . 
UNKNOWN You j still have older people . 
UNKNOWN It's only annoying if it if it's like that f formed like that , like f Whatever . 
UNKNOWN Just you have a normal But i it is it is it is already fancy . 
UNKNOWN There is one There's just one overall important aspect is that we must make it fancy and it looks original , and I hope we can uh make it look not like the iPod itself . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but we're we're aiming at a young public . 
UNKNOWN It must have uh uh uh a very different Yeah , they're all the same . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , idea . 
UNKNOWN But you're If you look at the way remote controls are now And if you make it look like the iPod Yeah okay . 
UNKNOWN Because of the lights on the bottom of it . 
UNKNOWN That's already fancy . 
UNKNOWN So that's already a very big change compared to Ye yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh maybe maybe make the the mm the wha what's it called uh scroll wheel . 
UNKNOWN Make it in in yellow or something . 
UNKNOWN Just like the colours of Real Reaction . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Well uh Could . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , we could do that . 
UNKNOWN Uh yeah , but uh if you the f uh front , the scroll wheel will still uh be yellow . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN No , I think Oh . 
UNKNOWN It's right . 
UNKNOWN Think the scroll wheel won't be very big . 
UNKNOWN Since if you put it uh somewhere , the chances that it will scroll are too big . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So it will just be a small small scroll wheel . 
UNKNOWN So it won't uh stick out much . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Maybe the ones we are going to drawthere . 
UNKNOWN Maybe we have to ask uh to the the mm to her if it has if it can work better than this . 
UNKNOWN Because it doesn't work properly . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN So maybe you have to ask her . 
UNKNOWN Yeah okay . 
UNKNOWN Well , maybe we can just open images there , and I'll paint and paint . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN I'll be able to do a better job . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN That's probably Okay , so just finish it . 
UNKNOWN If you set the pen yeah , he will drawhere . 
UNKNOWN Doesn't work . 
UNKNOWN So we make it a bit like m that one probably . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I'll see it . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Is that okay ? 
UNKNOWN Bu Yeah , I agree more like iPod . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay , only the colour and the flashy light and the We just we just skip the the the voca or was it the the speech recognition . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN Just a Speech . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , do we s keep that ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I think Well uh then it w Well that's very easy . 
UNKNOWN Or keep that ? 
UNKNOWN It's okay . 
UNKNOWN But you'd definitely need a advanced chip . 
UNKNOWN S Uh yeah , I don't know . 
UNKNOWN Uh No . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , I think so . 
UNKNOWN And we we have to build in a microphone and Yeah , and I do I don't know anything about that . 
UNKNOWN We already have uh the beeping of the home station , so Uh strange that I received the information about that . 
UNKNOWN I d I didn't receive any information on speech recognition , so Fine . 
UNKNOWN Oh that's hard . 
UNKNOWN But Uh the ma the main points I I I uh just said . 
UNKNOWN So Can we just put it speech recognition in it as well , okay ? 
UNKNOWN We have to be original and uh technological innovative . 
UNKNOWN Becau Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But Ma But we don't have any f information about the cost . 
UNKNOWN So shall we it open then ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So we can put all the Okay . 
UNKNOWN The function of that in there . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And we need a Probably we need a uh advanced chip then . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , we probably do . 
UNKNOWN But it doesn't say anything about it , does it ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN Oh yeah , I No . 
UNKNOWN We started with information about the cost was now th And how much is the chip ? 
UNKNOWN I just I just received the Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , uh I have I have some some information about the cost . 
UNKNOWN But just a about the chip . 
UNKNOWN The the the And how how does it work ? 
UNKNOWN I don't know how much , but Just in inexpensive or But i it's a separate chip . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , our division has developed a new speech recognition feature , the integrated programmable sample sensor simple speaker u unit . 
UNKNOWN This is a very small electronic unit , will give a standard answer after it recognise a question . 
UNKNOWN Is it No . 
UNKNOWN Doesn't say . 
UNKNOWN Just You say record , followed by your question sample , and after a few seconds the answer uh sample . 
UNKNOWN Because uh So it works like uh good morning remote control , and then the remote control says good morning . 
UNKNOWN It doesn't has to say anything . 
UNKNOWN Just You have to just talk to Okay , we have to stop it now . 
UNKNOWN Does it say does it say something back ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah uh th that's just It's a No . 
UNKNOWN So just Okay , that's a r That's that's a advanced Yeah , we just decide not to put it in , because it's too difficult . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , it Well that's integrated in the chip , so if you use the speech recognition , that's in it . 
UNKNOWN I dunno , but if we use speech recognition , that will be in it as well . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I don't know anything about this , but Nah . 
UNKNOWN Um Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I dunno . 
UNKNOWN Well it it would be would be a good feature feature . 
UNKNOWN Okay , we just put it in , because it's a good feature . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN No no worries about the cost , etcetera . 
UNKNOWN We have to stop now . 
UNKNOWN Okay , just We have to stop it now . 
UNKNOWN And there's a chip in it that will Okay . 
UNKNOWN Fine . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN It's not saved yet . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So Our beautiful drawing. 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So just f um So this is our agenda. 
UNKNOWN You're F You're going to show your pr prototype presentationafter me . 
UNKNOWN Oops . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Uh I didn't Oh yeah . 
UNKNOWN So these are the So these are the um last noteswe I made . 
CONFIRMATION Oh , okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN If anything doesn't look right , just say it to me then . 
UNKNOWN I don't have to put it in the report. 
UNKNOWN Are we doing the the speech recognition ? 
UNKNOWN Because we didn't have enough time to uh de um design the inside as well . 
UNKNOWN Okay , but it's still possible uh uh financially . 
UNKNOWN So if you want to , it's okay . 
UNKNOWN Okay yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well then then we're gonna put it in . 
UNKNOWN Okay , just Slideopen is uh quite usable for remote controls . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , just uh we have to design the inside then , but it should be uh It's may maybe uh a bit stronger as well . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , and Or are we making a slideopen , like underneath ? 
UNKNOWN Or fold open ? 
UNKNOWN I don't know . 
UNKNOWN It's probably better . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , s Like underneath uh you can slideit open and you other functions . 
UNKNOWN Maybe that's better . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's that's a very good point . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so when you have a lot of room inside . 
UNKNOWN Think that's better . 
UNKNOWN So you can make it very easy to use . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause you can write a lot of comments besides it . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So this is okay ? 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , we're gonna use the advanced chip then . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so that's Uh I'll just have a look how much that is . 
UNKNOWN The Yeah , I I think so . 
UNKNOWN But um Okay , for the Okay . 
UNKNOWN Advanced chip was for uh spee Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I don't know . 
UNKNOWN No , you have a different chip for speech recognition . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So So I already calculated that and it's still in the budget . 
UNKNOWN Ah okay . 
UNKNOWN So it's okay . 
UNKNOWN Good . 
UNKNOWN So you can show your prototype if you want to . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Together ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , it's Let's do it together . 
UNKNOWN I'll give comments . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , we just made a Word filewith the basic elements . 
UNKNOWN Uh the look-and-feel model . 
UNKNOWN Uh well the form , the case um as drawn there . 
UNKNOWN Simply a square with uh round corners . 
UNKNOWN So that's basically it . 
UNKNOWN Uh the material should be hard plastic . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Uh colour changeable , and also transparent . 
UNKNOWN And colour and transparent , or just transparent , I don't know . 
UNKNOWN Um then the elements . 
UNKNOWN Uh we have The functions are just basic . 
UNKNOWN Like uh I've pointed them here . 
UNKNOWN Mute function , on-off function , text functions . 
UNKNOWN This uh switch channel . 
CONFIRMATION Okay , cool . 
UNKNOWN And this is the the num-pad . 
UNKNOWN And the logo is over here , and the mic . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN And the scrollwheel , no ? 
UNKNOWN You operate that with your pointing finger . 
UNKNOWN Means Okay . 
UNKNOWN So you hold it like this in your right hand and Uh I dunno . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN So how many functions do you need for for uh the microphone ? 
UNKNOWN Speech recognition . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , speech recognition . 
UNKNOWN Just Only one button to say it's on or off . 
UNKNOWN Um I didn't have a specification of that . 
UNKNOWN But um I can imagine that you have to input your voice or something . 
UNKNOWN Um so I've Yes , you need options to configure it , and after that you don't need 'em anymore . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , maybe maybe uh you have to configure it . 
UNKNOWN So you can put it on the back as well if you want to . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , you can put 'em all on the back . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , or or on the slidefunction , I don't know . 
UNKNOWN That's for sure . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN That's uh We also don't know how many buttons are required , or what kind of buttons . 
UNKNOWN Well we haven't had time to design that , the slidepad . 
UNKNOWN But You have a lot of room if you can slideit open . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , you can put it separate . 
UNKNOWN You Yeah I know . 
UNKNOWN I can imagine you need at least four buttons or something . 
UNKNOWN So But it's enough room . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um the position ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , you write uh You wrote this , so . 
UNKNOWN Uh well Well the main , the main zap buttons are most central . 
UNKNOWN That was the the most important thing . 
UNKNOWN So uh the best place , the best reach place Um on-off buttons , text buttons , mute buttons are together and at a place they easily are , easy to find . 
UNKNOWN Um the on-off button is a bit bigger , uh so it stands out . 
UNKNOWN That way you don't have to make it red , 'cause it's will uh will show up . 
UNKNOWN Uh scrollwheel is on the left side . 
UNKNOWN It's basically the be standard place for scrollwheel , as far as I know . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But it's not uh impossible to use it , if you're left handed . 
UNKNOWN So y Because you can use your thumb then . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Just just one thing now . 
UNKNOWN Um y you need to have more uh one two th You've got one two three four five six seven eight nine . 
UNKNOWN Okay yeah , they Yeah okay . 
UNKNOWN But you missed the no uh the zero and uh the two stripes . 
UNKNOWN Mm yeah . 
UNKNOWN That's that's below that then . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , okay . 
UNKNOWN It's uh twelve buttons . 
UNKNOWN just so you get that . 
UNKNOWN Okay , but It's rather important . 
UNKNOWN Yeah okay , just we just missed that . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But um I'll just uh I'll get back to later . 
UNKNOWN F the form well , we've taken that from the iPod , other popular technical device . 
UNKNOWN So um should be popular . 
UNKNOWN Um The f uh the buttons creating ? 
UNKNOWN Uh if you That or all round shapes , not uh rounded corners . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So that , you know , you get a bit round feeling . 
UNKNOWN Um we'll use hard plastic . 
UNKNOWN Since that allows us to use uh two D_ buttons , uh non-rubber buttons . 
UNKNOWN Colour changeable . 
UNKNOWN Well and um the backlight thing , the thing that lights up . 
UNKNOWN We have decided uh in the the channel buttons , there's a little uh colour around it . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN And also in the num-pads , there's also colour light behind it . 
UNKNOWN And do you still can , do you still can choose what colour , kind of colour you want ? 
UNKNOWN So when you pre Yeah . 
UNKNOWN How do you want to implement that ? 
UNKNOWN Just on the Maybe on the second level as well ? 
UNKNOWN We're going to implement . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Mm just a little Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Ah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , these are just basic functions , so All the non-basic are in Okay . 
UNKNOWN Okay , just drawdrawthe second level , because we need that as well . 
UNKNOWN Um Okay , maybe we use this button for the Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay , there is one uh function I use uh daily , and it's not on the basic functions . 
UNKNOWN It's uh to switch to uh uh your Scart . 
UNKNOWN Play Station or uh D_V_D_ player . 
UNKNOWN That function must be Yeah , maybe Or you can uh i uh lay it uh beneath in the uh other uh functions . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I um To your video device . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , as well . 
UNKNOWN Just make make a Just just drawa second level one and say all options that are still left or something . 
UNKNOWN A second level ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Like a a new blank one or Or just here ? 
UNKNOWN No no , just on Down there . 
UNKNOWN Is i Ah okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So uh Just uh if you s Yeah , y Maybe , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And h how does the second level come out ? 
UNKNOWN Uh it slidesuh along ? 
UNKNOWN Um slidesI think . 
UNKNOWN It's You can do it that it claps open , but I think that's not solid enough . 
UNKNOWN From from the uh beneath ? 
UNKNOWN For the bottom . 
UNKNOWN No , you gotta slideit . 
UNKNOWN If that breaks then you're screwed . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , it's right . 
UNKNOWN So it do doesn't even have to slideall the way open . 
UNKNOWN Um Uh i the the speech functions buttons . 
UNKNOWN So what do we need ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , just God damn it . 
UNKNOWN Menu ? 
UNKNOWN Menu button . 
UNKNOWN With uh maybe uh arrows . 
UNKNOWN So you can uh scroll in the , navigate the menu . 
UNKNOWN Um I think we can even put a We have one for the zero and one for the for the more digit uh channels . 
UNKNOWN Scart ? 
UNKNOWN Uh yeah . 
UNKNOWN And so y you keep you keep one , you have one left . 
UNKNOWN So you have one left for the Right , the video channel , Play Station , etcetera . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN So this is the Extern or something . 
UNKNOWN That's used pretty often . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN If you have a Play Station , mm you use it every day . 
UNKNOWN It's a f basic uh Yeah , to navigate . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN You want to save that fileas well ? 
UNKNOWN The drawing? 
UNKNOWN That was it . 
UNKNOWN So here are multiple speech buttons , I don't know how many . 
UNKNOWN Uh It doesn't really matter . 
UNKNOWN Doesn't really matter . 
UNKNOWN I don't know the functions . 
UNKNOWN Just just uh Yeah . 
UNKNOWN That's Yeah well we don't have any uh Hmm ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN What else ? 
UNKNOWN What else ? 
UNKNOWN What else ? 
UNKNOWN Uh menu buttons with arrows . 
UNKNOWN Uh menu . 
UNKNOWN Uh With arrows . 
UNKNOWN S Just uh like Um I think it's best if we do . 
UNKNOWN Mm where do we have Or there . 
UNKNOWN Like a normal um Yeah , with in the middle um a menu button . 
UNKNOWN Like on the normal uh Like this . 
UNKNOWN The menu button , yes . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Well we don't have any , anything on how many buttons speech requires . 
UNKNOWN So you can't redesign it . 
UNKNOWN Mm okay . 
UNKNOWN Maybe one button to switch the colour of your uh LEDs ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN Uh and and you can hold it , you can hold it , and then the colours switch or mm multiple multiple buttons . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Just press it once , the colour should uh switch . 
UNKNOWN Press again , the colour switch again maybe ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Or we just make it three buttons , all the colours on it . 
UNKNOWN Just red , yel uh red , green and That's that's very easy , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Th Yeah . 
UNKNOWN If we have enough place , uh then we can do that . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , okay . 
UNKNOWN We can put those here . 
UNKNOWN Colour buttons . 
UNKNOWN And then we choose green , uh blue and red or Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN That's uh Um It Some text uh buttons . 
UNKNOWN So did we miss anything ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , maybe some uh some text next to the scroll wheel , that it is volume . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but there's one there's one text button I There's one text button I prefer . 
UNKNOWN I just uh The volume logo . 
UNKNOWN No , ma on on o on the on the Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Oh wh Here ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Just make it Yeah , just put it on those extra f extra function as well . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , or th or the Yeah . 
UNKNOWN That's the one uh that you use if you search for a page, uh like seven hundred , uh and it's counting from one hundred to two hundred , you will switch to your television and back to text . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , we have that on the the text button . 
UNKNOWN Do you do you Did you think of that ? 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but then you can switch back to normal telete teletext . 
UNKNOWN You just switch it off and then Well w we thought of a text button . 
UNKNOWN Uh why not ? 
UNKNOWN Ex Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN No Whoa I think um Yeah , the three stages . 
UNKNOWN And if you press it again , you get the the the through view . 
UNKNOWN The sta the state you Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Oh just three stages , you Yeah , that's okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , b but but if you're in the second stage , the third stage is switch teletext off . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN So you can switch back from second to w first . 
UNKNOWN No , it doesn't have to turn it off . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN Just don't Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Just remember where it was . 
UNKNOWN It it doesn't uh uh clear the the page. 
UNKNOWN If you if you turn teletext on , you you set the seven hundred , and you turn it off , then the next time you turn it on , it still stays on seven hundred ? 
UNKNOWN Yes , that's to remember . 
UNKNOWN Okay , okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but that's that's uh That's a functionality for the television . 
UNKNOWN But maybe it's not the way Mm . 
UNKNOWN I dunno if Yeah , I think as well , but Uh yeah . 
UNKNOWN That's maybe one thing we can discuss about . 
UNKNOWN Yeah mm nee uh No , if i uh the remote can send like the the code for seven hundred , pageseven hundred to the television . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , in thi the the remote control in the the chip . 
UNKNOWN Th th th if you switch it on . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but you have to search every time again . 
UNKNOWN Th i Yeah , I dunno . 
UNKNOWN That's what what happening if you do it like that . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's true . 
UNKNOWN But it's still the television that has to do that . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um do we need to fix that or Just like your telephone , hard plastic . 
UNKNOWN Mm most new T_V_s do uh collect all the pages. 
UNKNOWN No , that's what the television does . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , those memory functions . 
UNKNOWN But uh not not every every television , so Yeah , I I thought about one thing . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay , it's cool . 
UNKNOWN Was uh this logo for uh volume ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's fine . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So that's it ? 
UNKNOWN Is this prich pretty much it , yeah ? 
UNKNOWN Uh the buttons ? 
UNKNOWN Uh from which material are they now ? 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN No no Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Just hard plastic . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So Uh I think just um Yeah , but I think uh you have that problem more often with rubber buttons . 
UNKNOWN Because um if you use it a couple of years , some uh sometimes the numbers on the on the buttons are slideaway , are uh And maybe we can write the numbers below or above ? 
UNKNOWN It's too expensive to make it from a different material anyway . 
UNKNOWN Or shall we just turn it on on the buttons ? 
UNKNOWN I think just on the buttons . 
UNKNOWN If you do it abo above or below , it takes uh more space . 
UNKNOWN Well yeah . 
UNKNOWN That's too much place . 
UNKNOWN Okay , just leave it . 
UNKNOWN I don't think the space is worth it . 
UNKNOWN Just leave it . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , and i The most time Yeah , with rubber buttons . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Fine . 
UNKNOWN Yeah ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay , cool . 
UNKNOWN Mm mm mm mm mm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I don't know what this means . 
UNKNOWN But I think we just evela evaluated this one . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I made some criteria uh , so we can uh ev evaluate our model . 
UNKNOWN Oh okay , you made some criteria . 
CONFIRMATION Okay , cool . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN I d d d I don't think if it's right . 
UNKNOWN That shall show it . 
UNKNOWN You have some usability criteria or Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Uh no , uh all criterias we just argue about . 
UNKNOWN Uh Oh . 
UNKNOWN In the bottom . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Look-and-feel ? 
UNKNOWN Evaluation crit Yeah , evaluation presentation. 
UNKNOWN No , evaluation is Yeah beautiful's is also a matter of taste . 
UNKNOWN It's not in . 
UNKNOWN Uh d it doesn't matter um It only had two pagesor something . 
UNKNOWN Um well I looked in the reports um from the marketing strategy , or uh of uh the the the the the the new needs and uh the market . 
UNKNOWN The Italians uh , how they think about it . 
UNKNOWN And The research uh about uh the the comp uh the the the users and that kind of stuff . 
UNKNOWN I made some criteria , and we have to test the criteria from one to zero . 
UNKNOWN We sh we we we can give it uh a number , and then we can give ourself an average for our um model . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN And this These are all I I I found , or I wrote down . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN And um we have to discuss about , if we give it a one or a seven . 
UNKNOWN Uh Yes . 
UNKNOWN Uh I think uh if you have a kind of iPod idea . 
UNKNOWN It quite beautiful . 
UNKNOWN It's We are actu We are the Flashy . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , the the the difference be between uh beautiful and fancy uh look-and-feel is uh the the the outside uh beautiful uh like the iPod or something . 
UNKNOWN And fancy's more like the mm uh f the flashing lights and the colours and and that kind of stuff . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Well I think we do If it's really uh , if you can if you can get the iPod look , then it's beautiful , I think . 
UNKNOWN The LEDs . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN And and what ki what kind of what kind of basic colours uh were you thought uh of ? 
UNKNOWN But uh It's black . 
UNKNOWN Hmm ? 
UNKNOWN The basic colours are black or green or yellow ? 
UNKNOWN Or you haven't thought about Ho how do we make uh Black and yellow . 
UNKNOWN Um basic colours , um yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well you didn't say . 
UNKNOWN Maybe um company colours ? 
UNKNOWN Black . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , yellow light . 
UNKNOWN A bit a bit of yellow . 
UNKNOWN Can Black white , maybe ? 
UNKNOWN Do we have yellow light ? 
UNKNOWN No , not really , but it's possible . 
UNKNOWN Not not not yellow , but just a bit of light yellow . 
UNKNOWN It's Yeah , different colours . 
UNKNOWN Like white , also ni or uh always nice . 
UNKNOWN And what colours should the buttons be ? 
UNKNOWN Uh Because um Okay , so what uh number do we give uh a beautiful ? 
UNKNOWN This is Oh , the same as th th the cover . 
UNKNOWN Just um Yes . 
UNKNOWN But also th the light behind it . 
UNKNOWN But can you change those too , with uh the switch ? 
UNKNOWN No , no . 
UNKNOWN Make them No , just make them black or grey or something . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , grey . 
UNKNOWN Just dark grey I think . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Beautiful is uh really subjective , uh because it has to do lots with the colours . 
UNKNOWN Well we have changeable fronts , so So Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Changeable fronts , so ev for everyone for everyone it's something beautiful . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , just give it a one . 
UNKNOWN It's okay . 
UNKNOWN It's perfect . 
UNKNOWN I think it's just what you want . 
UNKNOWN Or not ? 
UNKNOWN It's hard to decide for us , but yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It's ju so subjective . 
UNKNOWN It it's At least it's a lot better than uh current remote controls . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay , just give it a two . 
UNKNOWN A two . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN The fancy look-and-feel . 
UNKNOWN That's about our uh flashing lights and the background uh lights uh from from from the buttons . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN And we can change the colours , so that's uh really fancy I think . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN One more thing . 
UNKNOWN So Slidepanel ? 
UNKNOWN Are w are we changing uh Or are they there uh backlights on the slidepanel too ? 
UNKNOWN Or n no back light ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah ? 
CONFUSION Mm . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN Not needed . 
UNKNOWN No , it's only on the number , behind the numbers and uh That as well , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , not needed I think . 
UNKNOWN And and the switch channel is uh There is a back light too ? 
UNKNOWN Oh , you mean th this here ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but that's unnecessary . 
UNKNOWN What do I think is necessary necessary item ? 
UNKNOWN It's pretty cool . 
UNKNOWN If you slideit open , it lights up . 
UNKNOWN That's that's really fancy , but I don't know if it's reachable . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Of course it's reachable . 
UNKNOWN It doesn't make No . 
UNKNOWN Then we do it . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Okay , maybe just some light uh to to light it all up . 
UNKNOWN So you can see what's really there . 
UNKNOWN Not just not re on the buttons or something . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Just a green light or some blue light . 
UNKNOWN To light it all up . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but Okay . 
UNKNOWN But Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Mayb Okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , just backlight . 
UNKNOWN Not not the buttons . 
UNKNOWN And th and the the normal backlights also not the buttons , but behind the buttons . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So the buttons are just grey . 
UNKNOWN Well yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh semi-transparent . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , just only Yeah , that's right . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Okay , fine . 
UNKNOWN So Yeah , that's how I think . 
UNKNOWN So I I think it's very fancy . 
UNKNOWN So I'll give it a Yeah , and you can uh also choose your light , so I think it's one . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , w we've done a a lot of detail in light , so Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Ye Yeah , this It is a one . 
UNKNOWN It's okay . 
UNKNOWN It's cool . 
UNKNOWN Okay , next . 
UNKNOWN This is a difficult one , because we we don't Yeah , we don't know it about the Uh it's it's very easy to use , but uh the second layer is not easy to use . 
UNKNOWN Learnable ? 
UNKNOWN Easy to use ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , we shall test it But uh Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It's That's No . 
UNKNOWN No , but you don't have to use that . 
UNKNOWN And you on don't have to pay attention to that second layer . 
UNKNOWN That's th that's the main thing that's so good about it . 
UNKNOWN So I think it's easy to use , but And learnable is a bit Well y just uh f Yeah , I think it's very clear what it all does . 
UNKNOWN Learnable ? 
UNKNOWN It's not not as fast as a usual uh uh remote control . 
UNKNOWN Well , I think it is . 
UNKNOWN Because because I think I think the scroll wheel , uh it's very handy , but the first time you get this thing in your hands , it's not to use the scroll wheel . 
UNKNOWN I think uh you must uh seek for it , and up or down or Uh then the re Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But the rest of it is very easy , because there are so so n So it is learnable um f i i In the first place it's very easy to use . 
UNKNOWN So so few information that you can easily decide what buttons w for what function . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN But the second parts , uh like speech , etcetera , that will be harder to learn . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN But Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It's Yeah it's Device . 
UNKNOWN And I think its scrollwheel is u easy to use as well , if you have ever used uh a different kind of uh of uh device . 
UNKNOWN But we we've got the two so two uh two or three uh new things , huh ? 
UNKNOWN And maybe we uh maybe learnable is in uh compare of old fashion uh remote controls . 
UNKNOWN So we h we have speech , uh the scroll wheel , and um the the the slide. 
UNKNOWN You must slideit . 
UNKNOWN And that's not normal at the uh normal remote controls . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause I think learnable is a l a less than um easy to use . 
UNKNOWN But yeah . 
UNKNOWN Because easy to use comes after learnable . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Okay , just Easy to use is very cool , so just give it a two . 
UNKNOWN I I think it a three or something . 
UNKNOWN Maybe three then . 
UNKNOWN Learnable's Yeah okay . 
UNKNOWN No , but definitely better , much better than uh than uh than avera average , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Mm uh . 
UNKNOWN The normal . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And the one you showed is just all buttons and you don't know Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yep , true . 
UNKNOWN Then a two . 
SURPRISE Oh .
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN New features . 
UNKNOWN Techno technological innovative ? 
UNKNOWN The speech function and the colour . 
UNKNOWN The speech function is new . 
UNKNOWN And the scrollwheel , backlights , slide. 
UNKNOWN Colour . 
UNKNOWN The scrollwheel and the slide. 
UNKNOWN Uh I think the slideis pretty new . 
UNKNOWN Slideis not n is is not new . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN I already have a Uh I already have a V_C_R_ and it's about from nineteen eighty eight . 
UNKNOWN Uh I only saw it in a telephone , not in an remote control . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN And they all have a slidein it .

CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Okay , and the the the lightning ? 
UNKNOWN That's cool . 
UNKNOWN Is that new ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah for a Uh for a f There are no games on it , that's that's It's not a one , it's a two again . 
UNKNOWN The lighting's new . 
UNKNOWN Mm it's pretty new , I think . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN Scrollwheel . 
UNKNOWN Speech ? 
UNKNOWN Speech is new . 
UNKNOWN Different colours , so Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , different fronts for a remote control , I think that's new too . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So we have a pretty new uh It's it's it's not not L_C_D_ or something . 
UNKNOWN That would And we didn't uh But then we also have the the home station . 
UNKNOWN But If you have Yeah . 
UNKNOWN We are forgetting about that now , but We don't recharge . 
SURPRISE Uh-oh . 
UNKNOWN Oh yeah , that's right . 
UNKNOWN Home-station . 
UNKNOWN Rechargeable . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , we didn't drawthat too , but Yeah , that's just a normal th s simple thing . 
UNKNOWN But that's more like uh now . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , just drawit afterwards . 
UNKNOWN I don't know . 
UNKNOWN If you Can you save it on the same , in the same mapas the other ones ? 
UNKNOWN In the the project uh map? 
UNKNOWN Uh Just save , save as ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Uh save as ? 
UNKNOWN No , that's not in the project . 
UNKNOWN Well it's a already in the folder . 
UNKNOWN L like number seven . 
UNKNOWN Oh yeah , okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Smart board . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but this one . 
UNKNOWN This one is not yet in the Oh oh . 
UNKNOWN I think it is . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , it is . 
UNKNOWN No , I think it is . 
UNKNOWN Uh untitled ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , it doesn't matter . 
UNKNOWN Save . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Uh all the the seven , uh all the seven . 
UNKNOWN But you still have to drawthe resi the recharger . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN And new features , so we give it a two or also again a one ? 
UNKNOWN No , I think i if you have games on it , then then you give you have a one . 
UNKNOWN No , we are not extraordinary new or something . 
UNKNOWN But not No , just so it's still a two . 
UNKNOWN Tha tha that No , we we we searched for uh um a young group , audience , beneath f forty . 
UNKNOWN Mm two , I think . 
UNKNOWN N Mm . 
UNKNOWN Targeted audience . 
UNKNOWN Uh we are the targeted audience ? 
UNKNOWN Do we like it ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but l younger than forty . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN So we we are exactly the targeted group . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but did we reach , um with our uh style , the targeted audience ? 
UNKNOWN Th that's my question . 
UNKNOWN I think so , yeah . 
UNKNOWN You get the fancy things for younger people . 
UNKNOWN And you get the the aesthetic things for older people . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN We've got a one for fancy look-and-feel , and that's what attracts the young audience . 
UNKNOWN So you want Yeah , you get different colours . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So think that's a two or a one . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um the only point is that we don't uh have uh uh That's that's That's this question . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but s it That's basically not not handy . 
UNKNOWN And I don't thi I don't see Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , this . 
UNKNOWN So we targeted it ? 
UNKNOWN But we didn't follow the latest trends . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , you could make a a front a front that's that's like uh like a banana , or something . 
UNKNOWN I think we followed the latest trends . 
UNKNOWN Tha these are the only latest uh trends I uh get on my computer . 
UNKNOWN Oh right . 
UNKNOWN Well uh fruit and vegetables , yeah . 
UNKNOWN You can different front uh This is a a power indicator . 
UNKNOWN Uh yeah , th So we had we uh have uh a fruit uh Oh yeah . 
UNKNOWN So Oh . 
UNKNOWN Like a a f banana kind of front . 
UNKNOWN But spongy will never be . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN So we give ourself a three or something . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So that's eleven . 
UNKNOWN That's uh What's the average ? 
UNKNOWN Eleven divided by six . 
UNKNOWN It's Yeah , it is one point eight three . 
UNKNOWN A perfect score . 
UNKNOWN No , I don't know . 
UNKNOWN We're not too hard on ourselves . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So you can see how far it's charged up . 
UNKNOWN And and you need n uh a button to call it , to let it beep . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN To call . 
UNKNOWN Um Okay . 
UNKNOWN Oh yeah , that's still Yeah , maybe we have to skip that one . 
UNKNOWN Call That's Yeah , but it No , we need that . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but uh we have to make a speaker then too . 
UNKNOWN If you want to make it beep . 
UNKNOWN No no , I want that in . 
UNKNOWN But we can we can do it uh underneath the logo . 
UNKNOWN That's usable . 
UNKNOWN If you do uh Yeah , okay . 
UNKNOWN That's really usable . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , th the speaker is very small as well , right ? 
UNKNOWN It's uh Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So I just got a financial um You s saved it or No . 
UNKNOWN Yes uh . 
UNKNOWN I did save it . 
UNKNOWN Okay , let's have a look at this one here , the production cost of it . 
UNKNOWN If I forgot anything , just say it to me . 
UNKNOWN It just is a battery . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , there are some that they didn't mention , because recharge is not on the list . 
UNKNOWN But okay . 
UNKNOWN So I think we are pretty much in the right direction , because it's twelve point three Euros . 
UNKNOWN Mm okay . 
UNKNOWN But uh is uh uh Okay . 
CONFIRMATION That's fine . 
UNKNOWN So this is a regular chip incl and and a sample speaker . 
UNKNOWN So that's both . 
UNKNOWN Come on , it's perfect . 
UNKNOWN Uh twelve point three point three . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , and single curved curved . 
UNKNOWN But but is it inc Does it include a a homestation or Can we make that for uh h twenty cents ? 
UNKNOWN No , that's not on the list . 
UNKNOWN But that shouldn't be . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , we can uh Um different fronts , but standard front won't be , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Probably . 
UNKNOWN I just The b the button supplements , I didn't I d I was wondering if this special colour maybe was I'm not sure . 
UNKNOWN See it's I think it's okay like this . 
UNKNOWN Special form , yeah . 
UNKNOWN It's hard to say . 
UNKNOWN But maybe we have to um Yeah , okay . 
UNKNOWN Special colour , you can skip this one , because it's all quite normal . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN We get different ones , that's all . 
UNKNOWN So you can put a recharger in it as well . 
UNKNOWN But this is expensive , the sample speaker . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN This ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , it's four . 
UNKNOWN Four . 
UNKNOWN It's four Euros . 
UNKNOWN Oh , them . 
UNKNOWN Is that uh included ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN In the twelve Euro or Okay , then we then we need to use it . 
UNKNOWN So we are Okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's included . 
UNKNOWN It's kind of weird that we we get this information now , afterwards . 
UNKNOWN Because Sure . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , no . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so this is uh pretty much it this . 
UNKNOWN Damn , solar cells are uh expensive . 
UNKNOWN So I just want you Yeah , we just made it . 
UNKNOWN So we can do the project evalu evaluation now for uh for everything together . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN We can do some discussion about this . 
UNKNOWN Was there room for creativity ? 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Paul , was there room for crea creativity ? 
UNKNOWN Beautiful . 
UNKNOWN Mm uh i Yeah , I think so . 
UNKNOWN I think uh everyone uh already . 
UNKNOWN So I think we uh discussed a lot of things about it . 
UNKNOWN Yeah m If we got a high mark for um uh innovativeness or innovativity then there we probably have been creative . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Or a different style . 
UNKNOWN So Of course there was . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN We could make a lot of different uh remote controls . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So it's creativity . 
UNKNOWN Huh . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so the leadership Was there a leadership and Okay . 
UNKNOWN What do you have to say about that ? 
UNKNOWN Who was the leader ? 
UNKNOWN No , I think Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I dunno . 
UNKNOWN Just normal discussion , I think . 
UNKNOWN Not one leader or something . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN One leader to check the time , etcetera . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And make notes. 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I know . 
UNKNOWN So more like a secretary . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay , next one . 
UNKNOWN Uh team work um The the third meeting I think that one was pretty hard . 
UNKNOWN We were not all We were not um agree with every not agree with . 
UNKNOWN Yeah yeah . 
UNKNOWN We were not finished . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , w we had so much information , that we get through emailand just Yeah . 
UNKNOWN We're not finished . 
CONFUSION Uh . 
UNKNOWN Uh I think we we got wrong information at the wrong time . 
UNKNOWN I think that was the m biggest problem . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Like uh the prices . 
UNKNOWN If we knew that before , we could have uh had discussion really uh s really quicker . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , th that's weird . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , because the prices uh could be twenty Euros or something now . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , and if you had uh fifteen Euros , then we would it . 
UNKNOWN And then Yeah . 
UNKNOWN We had to Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Hmm hmm yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , finance . 
UNKNOWN So we're bacal basically just lucky to uh get the price right . 
UNKNOWN But the teamwork was okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , uh everybody could speak their uh opinion . 
UNKNOWN And uh Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think uh everyone listen to each other . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Like marketing said things and then we had to i include them in the design . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , what I have to say about uh means . 
UNKNOWN The smart board is okay . 
UNKNOWN Digital pen is horrible . 
UNKNOWN I dunno if you use it . 
UNKNOWN But if you want to download it to your computer , it's doesn't work . 
UNKNOWN It was Just doesn't work . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN Well uh smart board would be very uh nice to work with , if it worked really well . 
UNKNOWN Digital pen or Yeah , the drawings are are hard to make , I think . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , i if if it would be faster , it would be great . 
UNKNOWN Just not work too slow . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , more accurate . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , it's i It should be more accurate . 
UNKNOWN Precise . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And uh I think it would be great if you could edit it from , just with a mouse , from where you're sitting . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Not just pointing out on it . 
UNKNOWN It's the same for the presenta for the presentations. 
UNKNOWN You can do it from here . 
UNKNOWN That's much easier than standing there . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And so you've Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , and p just point with a mouse . 
UNKNOWN No use to drawon the board itself . 
UNKNOWN It's just slows down . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Just old fashioned kinda blackboard style . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But you might as well do it in normal computer style . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , like . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , even harder to drawlike this than black board style . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And it's far too slow this way . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN You cou You could drawon it , but not as main function . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN I think Yeah , okay . 
UNKNOWN Digital pen . 
UNKNOWN So we made it in time . 
UNKNOWN And we made a remote control . 
UNKNOWN We did it . 
UNKNOWN In the budget , yeah . 
UNKNOWN New ideas found . 
UNKNOWN New ideas . 
UNKNOWN What's that ? 
UNKNOWN Oh I just think if we uh I dunno . 
UNKNOWN For for for To gather , or to uh work together , uh or new ideas for No , for the prototype . 
UNKNOWN I don't know what it mean . 
UNKNOWN Just For remote control probably . 
UNKNOWN No , for the project . 
UNKNOWN For remote control , a favourite for your text . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN New ideas . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but still , you couldn't make a fancy a f you couldn't make a a prototype out of this . 
UNKNOWN Because we don't have any sizes and Yeah , but it You can't possibly do that in such a short time , I think . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But it's for the next team . 
UNKNOWN We don't have to do that . 
UNKNOWN That's for . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , this this is just the idea phase , the Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , just brainstorming basically . 
UNKNOWN Details uh Quite early . 
UNKNOWN So are we finished ? 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Yes , I think just I just write a final report. 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN No , we have only four minutes left .

UNKNOWN Oh okay . 
UNKNOWN Oh , what do we have to do now . 
UNKNOWN Do we uh I thought we were done at four o'clock ? 
UNKNOWN It's now quarter past three .

UNKNOWN So that was it . 
UNKNOWN Now we can look at this . 
UNKNOWN This is The old versions . 
UNKNOWN We're probably not supposed to look at this , but Yeah , from the previous group . 
UNKNOWN They went for uh for a universal device . 
UNKNOWN The touchscreen , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but also a different device . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Then an L_C_D_ uh would be handy . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Here are the basic functions in here , the selecting dev devices . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , and touch screens for all our stuff , yeah . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN I do agree with that . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , tu-dum . 
UNKNOWN English is not so hard by the way . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN I'm breaking a world record here . 
UNKNOWN Well , leader ? 
UNKNOWN Oh shit . 
UNKNOWN Project Manager ? 
UNKNOWN We've got a problem , Paul . 
UNKNOWN You do ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , you have to make a choice . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN No it's your choice . 
UNKNOWN Wow , that's pretty quick . 
UNKNOWN Tu-dum . 
UNKNOWN Uh uh um You have to decide . 
UNKNOWN Just pick one . 
UNKNOWN It's the lower one .

UNKNOWN Yeah , then I put it there . 
UNKNOWN You are going to put it there . 
UNKNOWN Then It's a difficult choice , either here or there . 
UNKNOWN No one wins . 
UNKNOWN This is a very interesting design . 
UNKNOWN Ugly . 
UNKNOWN It's just the same as normal . 
UNKNOWN Oh a pen . 
UNKNOWN Well it has a L_C_D_ , I think . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but Then do it correctly . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Stupid design . 
UNKNOWN And what else do we have ?

UNKNOWN Good morning . 
UNKNOWN So Oh , good morning everyone . 
UNKNOWN Good morning . 
UNKNOWN Good morning . 
UNKNOWN I'd uh like to welcome you to our first meeting . 
UNKNOWN I've prepared a little presentation. 
UNKNOWN My name is and uh I hope you will introduce yourself uh in a few minutes , as will I . 
UNKNOWN Um I'm the Project Manager of this project , and uh , well I will tell you on what actually is the project . 
UNKNOWN This is uh the agendafor our first meeting . 
UNKNOWN Um this is the opening , then we will get I will hope we will get acquainted to each other . 
UNKNOWN We'll do a little tool training with these two things . 
UNKNOWN We'll take a look at the project plan . 
UNKNOWN Uh there will be time for discussion . 
UNKNOWN Actually we have to discuss because we have to create a product . 
UNKNOWN And then we will close this session . 
UNKNOWN Um but first of all we I'd like to uh introduce you to this room . 
UNKNOWN Um as you probably have noticed there are little black uh fields on the table . 
UNKNOWN Um you have to put your laptop exactly in that field so the little cameras can see your face . 
UNKNOWN Um there are cameras everywhere around the room especially here for your face , of course , and this isn't a pie , it's a a set of microphones and there are microphones here also . 
UNKNOWN But please uh don't be afraid of them . 
UNKNOWN They won't hurt you . 
UNKNOWN Well Well uh I'm uh and my uh function is User Interface Design , I think . 
UNKNOWN Um well uh I said I'm the Project Manager and uh I'm hoping uh for a good project and uh I'd like to hear uh who you are and what your functions are uh on this project . 
UNKNOWN Let's start with the ladies . 
UNKNOWN So uh that's me . 
UNKNOWN Okay , uh I'm uh I'm the Industrial Designer and I uh hope to uh look forward to uh a very uh pleasing uh end of this uh project . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so I . 
UNKNOWN Me too . 
UNKNOWN My name's . 
UNKNOWN I'm uh Marketing Expert . 
UNKNOWN My job is in the company to promote company or promote products to the customers . 
UNKNOWN So I also h hope we have a pleasant uh working with uh with each other . 
UNKNOWN Okay , well we have some expertise from uh different pieces of the of the company . 
UNKNOWN That's good . 
UNKNOWN Um well I said uh we're working on a project and the aim for the project is to to create a to design a new remote control which uh has to be original , trendy and of course , user friendly . 
UNKNOWN And uh I hope we have the expertise to create such a project such a product . 
UNKNOWN Um the way we hope to achieve that is uh the following methods . 
UNKNOWN It consists of three phases , namely the functional design , conceptual design and detailed design . 
UNKNOWN As you can see , all of these phases consists of two parts , namely individual work part and a meeting where we will discuss uh our work so far . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN But first I will uh tell you something about the tools we have here . 
UNKNOWN I already talked about the cameras and microphones , but they are not of uh much use to us . 
UNKNOWN Uh we will have to take advantage of these two things . 
UNKNOWN They are smart boards . 
UNKNOWN As you can see , you can give a presentationon them . 
UNKNOWN And uh this one here is a white board . 
UNKNOWN I will uh instruct you about that soon . 
UNKNOWN Um as you also noticed uh this presentationdocumentis in our uh project folder and every documentyou put in this folder uh is uh it is possible to show that here in our meeting room . 
UNKNOWN Um and yeah there are available on both smart boards but I think we will uh mainly use this one for the documentsin the shared folder . 
UNKNOWN As you can see , this is the same tool bar uh as is located here . 
UNKNOWN Um the most functions uh we will use will be to to add a new page, um uh to go back and forward between pages, and of course uh to save it every now and then . 
UNKNOWN Um and this is the pen with which you can drawon the board , for instance like this if everything's okay , but I first have to put it on the pen , you see I'm new to it too . 
UNKNOWN Um and then you can write things like test or whatever you want . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN As you can see you have to move it a little bit slow , it's not such a fast board , it's a smart board but also a slow board . 
UNKNOWN Uh but you can write things and of course you can also , when you click here , uh erase things , so we have uh est left . 
UNKNOWN And um you can also delete an entire page, but we ask you not to do that . 
UNKNOWN Just simply create a new one and uh start all over because we want to save all the results . 
UNKNOWN Um does everyone understand this nice application ? 
UNKNOWN So we can't erase anything . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well you can erase it with the eraser , but uh you shouldn't delete an entire page, but just create a new blank one . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN S Good . 
UNKNOWN I will delete this one now because we don't use it yet . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
UNKNOWN But you can of course erase when you make a mistake , but don't uh delete entire pages. 
UNKNOWN And you can also um let's see I think it's here uh change the uh colour of your pen , for instance take a blue one and uh change the line width like to five . 
UNKNOWN Um that's what you will need for our first exercise , because I'm uh going to ask you to drawyour favourite animal . 
UNKNOWN It's also to gets to know each other because um I'm asking three things , uh for that uh drawing, to do it on a blank sheet, with different colours and I just showed you how to pick a colour , and also with different pen widths which I also showed you . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um and a favourite characteristic can be just uh one word . 
UNKNOWN Well I'm not very good at drawing, but I will uh go first and um try to drawOr maybe you should guess what I'm drawing, eh . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN It's a sheep . 
UNKNOWN Dinos Dinosaur . 
UNKNOWN Seal , a seal . 
UNKNOWN Beaver . 
UNKNOWN A be Mm . 
UNKNOWN A beaver . 
UNKNOWN Well it uh could be everything . 
UNKNOWN It's weird . 
UNKNOWN With a tail and a mouth . 
UNKNOWN Maybe when I put on this thing it could be a turtle , or a snail , and But a turtle has . 
UNKNOWN It has wings ? 
UNKNOWN Turtle . 
UNKNOWN Snail . 
UNKNOWN Well the snail doesn't have legs . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN And those are slow . 
UNKNOWN And I hope our project group will not be slow , but we will uh work to a good result and do it uh as fast as we can . 
UNKNOWN Okay , time for another animal . 
UNKNOWN Would you like to go next ? 
CONFIRMATION Sure . 
UNKNOWN No problem . 
UNKNOWN No problem . 
UNKNOWN Oh right . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN It was four months ? 
UNKNOWN Nice , okay . 
UNKNOWN Well . 
UNKNOWN The hell . 
UNKNOWN To make it a little bit easier . 
UNKNOWN It's a giraffe . 
UNKNOWN Make that cute . 
UNKNOWN Or a dinosaur . 
UNKNOWN No , it's a giraffe . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN I think it's easy to r uh to recognise as a giraffe . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Giraffe . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , the favourite charis characteristic is that the long neck , it can reach everything . 
UNKNOWN And I hope I can also reach a lot with this project . 
UNKNOWN So that's my favourite animal . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Anything else you need to know ? 
UNKNOWN Could you write the words , uh underneath it ? 
UNKNOWN Oh , uh Tall . 
UNKNOWN Or more words . 
UNKNOWN Tall . 
UNKNOWN So , 'kay . 
UNKNOWN Should I uh Alright . 
UNKNOWN So I can draw, but uh Uh . 
UNKNOWN Well . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN B Bunny rabbit . 
UNKNOWN It's a mouse . 
UNKNOWN A bunny rabbit . 
UNKNOWN Oh wrong one . 
CONFUSION Uh . 
UNKNOWN Well uh you can guess what it is , I hope . 
UNKNOWN Uh-huh . 
UNKNOWN No problem . 
UNKNOWN It's a rabbit . 
UNKNOWN Little rabbits . 
UNKNOWN And uh well uh it's uh quick , I guess . 
UNKNOWN That's uh my uh favourite animal .

UNKNOWN Not really . 
UNKNOWN Well , nice animals , nice words . 
UNKNOWN Sounds good . 
UNKNOWN Um back to business , back to the money part . 
UNKNOWN Um from the finance department I have learned that we are aiming for a selling price of twenty five Euros . 
UNKNOWN And we're hoping for a aim of fifty million Euros and uh we are hoping to achieve that uh by aiming for an international market . 
UNKNOWN And the production cost will be twelve Euro fifty max . 
UNKNOWN Okay , well it's time uh for some discussion . 
UNKNOWN I've wrote down some examples here of what we can can speak about . 
UNKNOWN Uh what's your experience with remote controls , um what kind of ideas do you have to design a new remote control , maybe for which market segments should we aim , or should we aim for all segments . 
UNKNOWN Uh well actually I'd like to hand the word uh back to you . 
UNKNOWN What's your experience with remote control ? 
UNKNOWN A lot of buttons . 
UNKNOWN I always lose them . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And you always lose them . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN A lot of buttons which you don't use or who you don't use Complex . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Complex . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Not user friendly . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN search for the buttons , which one is which and uh Well . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN Boring . 
UNKNOWN Boring , it's not fun to use a remote . 
NEGATION No . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Black , all black . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Black colours . 
UNKNOWN Well maybe we should try to make it fun . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN They use batteries and batteries uh and poor signal . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Uh . 
UNKNOWN The the angle you have to use . 
UNKNOWN Perhaps that you have a lot of road remotes r road con remote controls . 
UNKNOWN You had different remote controls for different devices . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , different remote controls , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yes , perhaps you can integrate them or something . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN Uh for the use of different uh devices . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Your stereo and your T_V_ and uh . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Perhaps that's an idea . 
UNKNOWN Yeah but then again you you still have a lot of buttons , so Flap yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's right . 
UNKNOWN Yeah but you could uh I thin uh there's a possibility to g uh to uh to put those buttons uh behind some uh kind of uh protection so that if y y you only get to see them when you need 'em . 
UNKNOWN And which you don't use . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
CONFIRMATION Yeah , okay , that's possible , but it'll get very big the the remote control . 
UNKNOWN That's possible , so that you only get the No n n no , just Uh for example you got th uh the same size uh remote control you use everyday , but um the usual buttons such as uh um zapping uh as you call it in Dutch . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN You should just give it to . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Uh and the volume control uh are only the only possible buttons uh to use directly . 
UNKNOWN Changing channel . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Or uh the numbers , of course . 
UNKNOWN numbers . 
UNKNOWN But uh not uh the buttons used to search on the the channels on your television . 
UNKNOWN On and off . 
UNKNOWN You only use those uh the first time , or . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , play , pause , stop . 
UNKNOWN So . 
CONFUSION Uh . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So maybe a a minimalist design , the least uh possible amount uh of buttons . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I think so , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN But you should make sure that you have every button they need on it . 
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm , of course . 
UNKNOWN Because uh things for uh teletext , I dunno uh , w what's the name ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , uh teletext . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN think so . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So you don't want to bother people with uh loads of buttons , but on the other hand they need many buttons so they don't have to get out of their seat . 
NEGATION No . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But But if if it's if it's international you should uh look in think in Britain they have uh different things they can do with the T_V_ , or so uh that you can choose what you want to see . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Because I think a market will be all kind of people . 
UNKNOWN Elderly p el elderly , young people , so . 
UNKNOWN I dunno if you should uh take that in consideration , or that you just should aim for the normal T_V_s that uh And the B_B_C_ . 
CONFUSION Uh . 
UNKNOWN Yeah I think that's the better one , because I think if you you're going to target a lot of people and the whole world and only Britain then I think the cost will uh rise higher than the twelve fifty , I think . 
UNKNOWN Yeah I I understand . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I don't know if the they have that anywhere else , though . 
UNKNOWN I think the aim is better to use uh the whole world and Britain , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , we can leave that . 
UNKNOWN When I think of it uh I think the main idea uh of this remote remote control is uh to make it user friendly . 
UNKNOWN Not that much . 
UNKNOWN So uh I think uh when p uh when uh the customers will buy this remote control , they already have uh the remote control which uh companies uh uh with uh the the standards uh remote control with which comes uh with the television . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Standard deliver . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN So uh it only has to have uh the most used buttons . 
UNKNOWN You don't have to integrate the buttons to search the channels on your television . 
UNKNOWN In those in that Yeah but I but it is impossible to uh to accommodate uh accommodate uh all the buttons on the s on the difference different televisions sets on one remote control . 
UNKNOWN No but Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well but but then you have to to find your other remote control if you want to search . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , th it it's I think that's not Yeah , okay . 
UNKNOWN That's not Yeah , that's right . 
UNKNOWN It's impossible . 
UNKNOWN Because uh for example Sony television uh has the opportunity to s to make uh uh to make it possible for to see on one side of the screen uh teletext , and on the other side uh just n uh regular television . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN Yeah that's uh . 
UNKNOWN Uh Yeah , but uh they don't use the same signal , uh on remote control . 
UNKNOWN I think n m n most televisions nowadays do this . 
UNKNOWN Well not everywhere . 
UNKNOWN So I think numerals . 
UNKNOWN Because you can't use a Panasonic uh remote control on a on a Philips television . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but then you have to choose the this always with r universal remotes you have to choose the code . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , you can choose the code . 
UNKNOWN You can use which which type of television you have . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN That's no problem . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN But I think like the two pageson the same screen , like teletext and normal television , that's that's nowadays standard , I think . 
UNKNOWN Okay , but uh I think that most people uh th uh will buy the remote control because because uh the first they lost the one they lost first one or the first one is broken , so uh uh perhaps they have a got a an older television , so that option is not uh optional for those uh people . 
UNKNOWN Simplicity . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah g available . 
UNKNOWN But the people have a new television , and c if you look into the future , then they want will want the button , if their thing is broke . 
UNKNOWN True . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So we should take that in consideration . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Okay , well any more ideas ? 
UNKNOWN Oh mm , no . 
UNKNOWN Of course . 
UNKNOWN No ? 
UNKNOWN Guess not . 
UNKNOWN Things'll come up . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay , yeah well we have some time . 
UNKNOWN Let's see what more I have to tell you . 
UNKNOWN I don't think there is much left . 
UNKNOWN Nope . 
UNKNOWN We're starting to close . 
UNKNOWN Um our next meeting uh will start well we're a little bit early , but our next meeting will start in in thirty minutes . 
UNKNOWN In the meantime uh there's time for some uh individual actions . 
UNKNOWN Um , as you can see , the different roles have uh different tasks . 
UNKNOWN And there's a ping . 
UNKNOWN Is it my laptop ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN Stop the meeting now . 
UNKNOWN Ah well that's good , five minutes and uh the meeting's over , uh right on schedule . 
UNKNOWN Yeah meeting will close in five minutes . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um the Marketing Expert will uh will take a look at the user requirement specification . 
UNKNOWN The User Interface Designer will work out the technical functions design . 
UNKNOWN And this was the Interface Designer ? 
UNKNOWN Or the Interaction Designer . 
UNKNOWN Hmm hmm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Or what was it , I_D_ ? 
UNKNOWN No interface . 
UNKNOWN No ? 
UNKNOWN Interface . 
UNKNOWN Interface Designer , okay , first guess was right . 
UNKNOWN Uh will take a look at the the working design . 
UNKNOWN No , the Industrial Designer will take a look at the working design , and the in uh usability interaction Yeah , okay . 
UNKNOWN No the Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Industrial Designer , okay , sorry . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Let's just use the acronyms . 
UNKNOWN So So I should look at uh what you should be able to do with the remote , or uh , or how I don't really Right . 
UNKNOWN Um and of course specific instructions uh will be sent to you uh through your personal coach . 
UNKNOWN Uh well those instructions will be uh in the emailyou will receive uh shortly , I hope . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
UNKNOWN Me too . 
UNKNOWN And of course you have your own uh expertise . 
UNKNOWN Well uh that was what I had to say . 
UNKNOWN Uh-huh . 
UNKNOWN Uh are there any more questions ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
NEGATION No . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN No ? 
UNKNOWN Okay well I think then we have to head uh back to our offices and uh start working . 
UNKNOWN I have one question . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Okay , one question ? 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN Where does it says we have to make a remote , because I presumed She didn't know who . 
UNKNOWN Okay , no , no problem . 
UNKNOWN Okay we're still going . 
UNKNOWN No problem . 
UNKNOWN No problem . 
UNKNOWN Okay , well I expect everything will be much clearer with the instructions we will receive uh shortly . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
UNKNOWN Okay well uh see you all in about thirty minutes , then . 
UNKNOWN Alrighty . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
THANKS Thank you very much . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Good morning , again . 
UNKNOWN One question . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Choose a number ? 
UNKNOWN Send . 
UNKNOWN Submit . 
UNKNOWN Yep yep yep yep . 
UNKNOWN All set ? 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Good . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Let's see what we can find here . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN A very warm welcome again to everyone . 
UNKNOWN Um here we are already at our uh functional design meeting . 
UNKNOWN Um and this is what we are going to do . 
UNKNOWN The opening , which we are doing now , um and the special note , I'm project manager but on the meetings I'm also the secretary , which means I will make uh minutesas I did of the previous meeting . 
UNKNOWN And uh I also put these as fast as possible in the uh project folder , so you can see them and review what we have discussed . 
UNKNOWN Um if I'm right , there are three presentations, I guess each one of you has prepared one ? 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN Good . 
UNKNOWN And um we will also take a look at new project requirements , um if you haven't heard about them yet . 
UNKNOWN And then of course we have to take a decision on the remote control functions and we have some more time , forty minutes . 
UNKNOWN But I think we will need it . 
UNKNOWN Um well I don't know who wants to go first with his presentation. 
UNKNOWN I'll go first . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I'll go first yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well . 
UNKNOWN You can go first , okay . 
UNKNOWN Well , shall I go first with the users ? 
UNKNOWN Well everybody already has his presentation, so you can adjust it . 
UNKNOWN I think well okay no problem . 
UNKNOWN Is there an order ? 
UNKNOWN I haven't And one question , uh your name Denni , is it with a I_E_ E_I_E_ , okay . 
UNKNOWN Ja precies , ja precies , ja precies E_I_E_ . 
UNKNOWN So . 
UNKNOWN Huh ? 
UNKNOWN Okay , um Okay , um I wanted to explain the working design of the remote control . 
THANKS Thank you . 
UNKNOWN It's possibly very handy if you want to uh design one of those . 
UNKNOWN Um well so it basically works uh as I uh uh r wrote down uh in this uh little uh summary . 
UNKNOWN Uh when you press a button , uh that's when you do pr for example when you uh want to turn up the volume , um a little connection is made uh the the rubber uh button just presses on a on a little printplate uh which uh makes uh uh a connection that uh gives the chips , uh which is uh mounted beneath those uh that plastic of a rubber button . 
UNKNOWN Sorry . 
UNKNOWN Uh senses that a connection has been made , and know and knows what button you pressed , becau uh for example the the volume up or volume down button . 
UNKNOWN Um uh the the chip uh makes a Morse code uh like uh signal which uh then is si uh signalled to uh several transistors which makes uh which sends the signal to a little let . 
UNKNOWN You know what a let is ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN And that makes uh the the infra-red lights signal which is sent to the television set . 
UNKNOWN Uh which has a sensor in it to uh sense uh the signal of the infra-red . 
UNKNOWN That's basically uh how it works . 
UNKNOWN Um the findings uh uh that I found uh searching up some uh detailed information about the remote controls , are that uh they are very easy to produce , uh it is pis uh it's possible to uh make them in mass production because it is as eas it is as easy as uh printing a page, uh just uh fibreglass plate um is b uh is uh covered with uh some uh coatings and uh uh and chips . 
UNKNOWN Uh and the technology's already available , we don't have to find out how remote controls uh have to work or uh how that how uh to make some chips that are possible to uh to to transmit those uh signals . 
UNKNOWN Uh I made a little uh uh animation of about how a tran our uh remote controller works . 
UNKNOWN Oh right . 
UNKNOWN Animation . 
UNKNOWN we tel There . 
UNKNOWN There is something turning . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , it's a little bug it's in the in the smart board . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Uh well the sub-component , I suppose that you understand what a sub-component is , is f in this example it's the button . 
UNKNOWN Uh when it is pressed down , um , the switch is ter is uh is switched on , so with uh the wire is sent to the to the chip in uh co-operation with the battery of course , because to make uh a a signal possible you have to have some sort of uh li uh a d ad uh electronic uh Yes , uh , okay . 
UNKNOWN Infrared light . 
UNKNOWN Um w after it's being composed by the chip uh the signal uh is transported uh to the infra-red bulb , and from there it signals a Morse code-like signal to the to the b to the bulb in uh in the television set . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN S Uh I wrote down some personal preferences about uh the remote control . 
UNKNOWN Of course it is very handy if the remote control is hand held , so you don't have to uh uh wind it up or something , or just is it's it's very light to uh to make uh to use it . 
UNKNOWN Uh I personally uh pref prefer that uh it would be p uh come available in the various colours , and uh easy to use buttons . 
UNKNOWN But I suppose that the one of the other team members uh uh thought of that uh too . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I've got it there too . 
UNKNOWN And it is possible for several designsand um easy to use b uh sorry , easy to use buttons . 
UNKNOWN Perhaps soft touch , uh touch screen uh buttons because uh the rubber buttons are always uh uh they uh slightly uh they can be slightly damaged , uh so the numbers on the buttons are not possible uh to read anymore . 
UNKNOWN And uh well as I said uh before th uh we can uh make several designs. 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay , well , that's my contribution to this meeting , and uh two of these this meeting . 
UNKNOWN To this meeting . 
CONFIRMATION Okay , thank you . 
UNKNOWN Shall I go uh next ? 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN So . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN Please . 
UNKNOWN So . 
UNKNOWN Smoking . 
UNKNOWN Well uh , my name's , and I looked at uh technical functions design of the remote . 
UNKNOWN Uh I did this by uh looking at examples of other remote controls , of how they uh they look , and information from the web that I found . 
UNKNOWN Um well what I found was that uh th the actual use of the remote control is to send messages to television set , how you uh d what you described uh just early . 
UNKNOWN And this can be all sorts of medsa messages , turn it on , turn it off , uh change the channel , adjust volume , that kind of thing . 
UNKNOWN Uh play video , teletext , but also t uh play C_D_ if you use it your C_D_ player the remote control will that one . 
UNKNOWN There are some uh examples of remote controls . 
UNKNOWN You can see they are very different . 
UNKNOWN The one has got all the functions that you could possibly need and an lot of uh buttons etcetera . 
UNKNOWN And the other is uh more user friendly , little with big buttons . 
UNKNOWN And uh not n all the the the the stuff you can do with it , but uh the the essential stuff is there . 
UNKNOWN Um I guess you could better y you should look at a a user centred uh approach , because the customers have to use them and and if they don't think it's usable they won't uh buy it . 
UNKNOWN A lot of buttons they may think from I don't need s as much as that . 
UNKNOWN Uh , well perf personal preferences is is uh a simple remote , with uh the basic functions that you can need that you could use . 
UNKNOWN But uh keep in mind the new functions of T_V_ what we discussed earlier , split screen and uh is that a function that you should have ? 
UNKNOWN Because all the T_V_s will have them . 
UNKNOWN Or because of only a few and isn't really necessary . 
UNKNOWN And then uh make it I would make so that you can could uh use it on more than one appliance . 
UNKNOWN If you have one that uh uh does with the vi the the video , it could also work with uh with the stereo , because play is play and stop stop and that sort of thing . 
UNKNOWN The shu c you could reuse the buttons so that you don't have to have a lot of buttons for uh anything . 
UNKNOWN And it should be a user friendly , clear buttons , and not too much . 
UNKNOWN And that is my presentation. 
CONFIRMATION Okay , thank you . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN Check . 
UNKNOWN You must still have it open . 
UNKNOWN Kijke 'Kay , so . 
UNKNOWN We're going to j discuss the functional requirements of the remote , that m that means that functions user n want to have on the remote control , or just Yeah , and the users , actually . 
UNKNOWN The methods I I prefer is we're going to look which section of the users we are going to focus a l on more . 
UNKNOWN Are the younger people going to buy the remote control or the elderly people ? 
UNKNOWN And then tho that section we're going to focus and adjust the remote more to that section than the whole user section . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Some data . 
UNKNOWN Younger people , from sixteen to thir forty five um years are more interested in fj features like L_C_D_ screens , speech recognition e etcetera . 
UNKNOWN And we possess about two third of the market from in that range of age . 
UNKNOWN The elderly people , from forty five years to sixty five years are not that much interested in features , and we possess less than two third , that's two fifth , of the market share in that area . 
UNKNOWN Goed so . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN Findings . 
UNKNOWN Fifty percent of the users lose their remote often . 
UNKNOWN So we don't have to make it very small , like uh like a mobile phone or something , but some somewhat bi bigger than small , so you don't lose it that much anymore . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Seventy five percent of the users also find it ugly , and fif seventy five of the users zap a lot , so the buttons sh should be that small , or shouldn't be that complex because we have to search for the buttons , which one are you going to use . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Next . 
UNKNOWN Important issues about the remote . 
UNKNOWN I think it would be better with a personal reference , but okay . 
UNKNOWN Remote control has to have to have a low power usage , because s w seventy five percent of the users only zap one time an hour , so the power usage is also one one time an hour , or so , with a high power usage we would use a lot of but batteries . 
UNKNOWN The volume button and the channel buttons are the two most important buttons on the remote control , so those they those have to h be find very easily . 
UNKNOWN And have to be somewhat like bigger etcetera . 
UNKNOWN It has also be have to find easily when the label is gone . 
UNKNOWN My colleague also announced it that labels should be scratched off or would be s uh senden okay . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN So uh if that's k uh if that's the problem , you also have to find it easily on the remote . 
UNKNOWN Buttons . 
UNKNOWN Like what all colleagues said , have to have to be minimalized . 
UNKNOWN or should be covered , or in L_C_D_ screen . 
UNKNOWN L_C_D_ screen is easy because we have the L_C_D_ screen , we have the various options . 
UNKNOWN Put one option and then you have the all the buttons of that options , so the other options would be gone . 
UNKNOWN And you don't see the buttons . 
UNKNOWN So L_C_D_ screens should be easy , but an L_C_D_ screen , the problem with the L_ sc L_C_D_ screen is that elderly people fr from forty five to for sixty five years don't use the L_C_D_ screen a lot . 
UNKNOWN So we have to that keep that in mind that if you're going to implement L_C_D_ screen , you don't have to make it that hard to learn or to use . 
UNKNOWN Uh L_C_D_ screen as in uh touch screen ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , touch screen , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN The last but not least , younger people are more critical about the features . 
UNKNOWN Because they use the remote control often more often , and are more technical than the ol older people . 
UNKNOWN And the older people spend more money , and easily on a remote control . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN So we have to keep in mind to to focus not a lot not that much on the younger pep younger people , but also somewhat on the elderly people . 
UNKNOWN And on my personal preferences , I don't have any mo more time to come with that , but like I said , L_C_D_ screen is easily to use because you have you can implement a lot of buttons in one remote with not that much buttons . 
UNKNOWN And it should be easy to use . 
UNKNOWN Especially the volume buttons , the channel buttes buttons and the number buttons to zap through the channels . 
UNKNOWN And that is it . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay , thank you . 
UNKNOWN Oh right . 
UNKNOWN Um , well thank you all , huh . 
UNKNOWN I dunno uh did everyone receive an emailwith uh the new project requirements ? 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN No ? 
UNKNOWN Well , then I think it's a good thing that I made a separate slideof them so you can all read them . 
UNKNOWN Res I did not . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN Perhaps the rest ? 
UNKNOWN Ja , Be television . 
UNKNOWN Oh , well not in this presentation. 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Should be in there . 
UNKNOWN Well , I can tell you them uh from my laptop . 
UNKNOWN Um teletext does has become outdated since the popularity of the internet . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN So that's uh the first thing we I think we should pay less attention to uh teletext . 
UNKNOWN Uh the remote control should only be used for the television , otherwise the project becomes more complex , which endangers the time to market , and of course would make it more costly , I think . 
UNKNOWN Um our current customers are within the age group of forty plus , and new product should reach a new market with customers that are younger than forty , and you talked about that before . 
UNKNOWN And uh a last point , but also very important , our corporate image should stay recognisable in our products , which means that our uh corporate colour and slogan must be implemented in the new design . 
UNKNOWN So we have to keep that in mind . 
UNKNOWN Um well uh according to our agendait's then time to take a decision on the remote control functions . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN So , who has any idea about what should be on it , and what shouldn't ? 
UNKNOWN Well you said it should only uh work with one appliance ? 
UNKNOWN Or with one uh d che only the T_V_ ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Only be used for television . 
UNKNOWN And the video also , or not uh ? 
UNKNOWN Only the television . 
UNKNOWN Well it says only for television here , huh . 
SURPRISE Oh .
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Makes it a lot easier , huh ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN So yeah , then you can yeah . 
UNKNOWN Requirements , no ? 
UNKNOWN Functions . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Then it should have uh on , off , and uh Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah for Standby options , yeah ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , the basics then by a volume , channel , one till two zero numbers on it , oh teletext doesn't have to be ? 
UNKNOWN Uh yeah . 
UNKNOWN And per perhaps uh No . 
UNKNOWN Um other functions . 
UNKNOWN Well uh uh yes yes s sh A button where you can uh change from one number to two numbers . 
UNKNOWN Yeah I had Yeah , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Two s two two digits , oh okay . 
UNKNOWN Can you Don't know if that's got a name , but Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah I understand what you mean . 
UNKNOWN I think it's I think it's easy to implement a button with a s s what which especially do that , because some T_V_s , if you press the t one and then the two , it be between five secs it make twelve , and that's that's not relaxed to user . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It makes it twelve , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Indeed . 
UNKNOWN S Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Well , not really And and there are some models that don't uh accommodate that function . 
UNKNOWN So d uh wh the Philip's television makes it possible in that indeed to uh press one and then two to make uh the uh tj to reach channel twelve . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So that it easy and fast . 
UNKNOWN But uh all the television makes uh use of those button where you first press that button and then press two digits to uh to get Uh yeah , think so . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , so you should have that one on . 
UNKNOWN Our main targets' age are ? 
UNKNOWN were ? 
UNKNOWN Forty five plus , or ? 
UNKNOWN Mute misschien also . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Uh well new product should reach a market with customers that are younger than forty , and now we have current customers uh of forty plus . 
UNKNOWN Forties , okay because because younger people as Uh younger people have now , sixteen till to twenty five age , are f eighty one percent interested in L_C_D_ screen . 
UNKNOWN From twenty six to thirty five have sixty six percent , and thirty six to forty five , fifty five percent , so I think to um Because on most recog remote controls um the printplate will be broken how much , two years . 
UNKNOWN You have to press h very hard to go to the next channel . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN With the L_C_D_ screen it's easier because you only have to wipe the screen to uh for fingerprint , and then you can use it again . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , we we could yeah . 
UNKNOWN But I think that uh that collides with our mission to make it very cheap . 
UNKNOWN Because L_C_D_ screens are very expensive . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah but a you don't know True . 
UNKNOWN A touch screen uh probably uh even more . 
UNKNOWN An But , do you But if you would do an L_C_D_ screen do we have don don't you have any buttons ? 
UNKNOWN So , true , true . 
UNKNOWN But uh Well um is it possible to make an L_C_D_ screen uh , how was the information ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , it only says that this perce percentage like L_C_D_ screen . 
UNKNOWN Because , yeah and it says that younger age between sixteen and forty five highly interesting features more critical . 
UNKNOWN And if the only f Yeah , because our target is sixteen to forty five . 
UNKNOWN So perhaps we should we should focus on that L_C_D_ screen . 
UNKNOWN Yeah but uh will we not uh exceed our uh our uh production uh Is it possible to find out , anyway ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah you don't know how much it costs . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , you don't know how much it costs , the L_C_D_ screen . 
UNKNOWN No , I don't have any costs here , I only have percentages . 
UNKNOWN You know ? 
UNKNOWN Or because if it only directs at the T_V_ , then you only have uh I don't know what you want to do with the L_C_D_ screen . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN No , an L_C_D_ screen's just like uh like a drawn here . 
UNKNOWN Um just uh displays several buttons , for example um if you wanted the minimal uh use b uh buttons , such as channel and volume , you just h uh displays four buttons on the screen and it's possible to p uh press them down , just like a touch screen . 
UNKNOWN Yeah ? 
UNKNOWN Oh right , so you can Oh , yeah alright . 
UNKNOWN So you can adjust which buttons you want on that s screen . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , if you want to adjust , like for example , adjust the audio settings , you press audio on the touchscreen and you get the buttons for audio settings , so the other buttons are gone . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , we can make it possible to do that , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah alright , oh right . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah . 
UNKNOWN So we're going for an L_C_D_ screen ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think it's the most easier thing , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Would be yeah . 
UNKNOWN That's my uh Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And hoping that when we produce a lot it won't be too expensive . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN Well we had twelve fifty , I guess , for uh production ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Twelve fifty . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I dunno how expensive an L_C_D_ screen is . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Any guesses ? 
UNKNOWN Well I suppose wi if the mar if our um if the i if the young people are interested in L_C_D_ screens , we should make 'em . 
UNKNOWN Highly . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN And if that is our d uh market share to uh and our goal to uh deliver those uh remote controls Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But But he also said that we should not only focus on the younger people , but also on the older , and will they use it if it only has an L_C_D_ screen ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but Um , s forty six to forty five , thirty three percent , and sixty fifty six to sixty five twelve percent . 
UNKNOWN But our our our what's it , project requirements are the new products should be reached for new markets , to customers that are younger than forty . 
UNKNOWN Oh , so still a little bit people Yeah that's right . 
UNKNOWN But you don't want to alienate the other uh But if they also buy it then it's alright . 
UNKNOWN No , that not now , but , so Yeah , but market share fro for for forty years and younger is higher than that of sixty five and younger . 
UNKNOWN I guess . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so L_C_D_ it is ? 
UNKNOWN An Yes . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN It's treasure . 
UNKNOWN And what else ? 
UNKNOWN I hope we uh h and let's hope to reach those uh those sales . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , i i if it Yeah , if it costs gets too much , too expensive , then yeah , we should be sticking to rubber buttons . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , can you um uh s I think that that they will send you some information about uh the cost of L_C_D_ uh screens . 
UNKNOWN N nothing , no costs at all . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh so if you uh Yeah , so if you uh you receive an emailabout that , uh can you post it in the or shouldn't we post that in uh our projects mailuh folder . 
UNKNOWN But perhaps later , so uh Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , in I think that should yeah I think we all get the costs of everything . 
UNKNOWN I don't Well perhaps we should have a backup plan that we would use buttons if it's uh too expensive . 
UNKNOWN Because you are the the Marketing uh Expert . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , okay , I'll I'll post it . 
UNKNOWN I uh Yeah sure , sure . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , okay . 
UNKNOWN But for now it's L_C_D_ . 
UNKNOWN Okay , L_C_D_ , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Then you have the seventy five percent of users find it r ugly . 
UNKNOWN The L_C_D_ ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , and eighty percent of the users would spend more money with a when a remote would look fancy . 
UNKNOWN Oh that's a bit of a problem . 
UNKNOWN Oh , that's a bit of a problem . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Tha i l i it'll look fancy with L_C_D_ screen . 
UNKNOWN It's looks fancy one yeah , of L_C_D_ screen . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but they don't they don't like it . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN They think it's ugly . 
UNKNOWN When it has an L_C_D_ screen . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , just a the plain remotes , not not specific L_C_D_ remotes . 
UNKNOWN Oh , alright , I thought that you said that . 
UNKNOWN So Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , and maybe you can make something fancy out of an L_C_D_ remote , because it's new , as far as I know . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , of course . 
UNKNOWN Mm yeah . 
UNKNOWN And then you have the other thing , that seventy five percent zap a lot , but that's not a f question with the L_C_D_ screen . 
UNKNOWN And then not yeah . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Only thing you have to do is wipe the screen off once each time , to get all the fingerprints off it . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Okay ? 
UNKNOWN Okay , what else does our remote need ? 
UNKNOWN Um Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN A mute button . 
UNKNOWN Mute button . 
UNKNOWN I think . 
UNKNOWN The most important things on a f on an on an uh remote control are channel selection , volume con selection , and power s power usage . 
UNKNOWN And Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And a teletext , but that is not of the question . 
UNKNOWN But But shouldn't you put a button of for teletext on the for the people who want to use it ? 
UNKNOWN Other things are Sorry ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , it could be . 
UNKNOWN Remembering we have got a big remote that you have to fill . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , and we could make an a a separate menu on the L_C_D_ uh screen for teletext . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , teletext . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And there's also a A sh but in a sub sub-menu or something like that . 
UNKNOWN And other other less important things are screen settings , audio settings , and channel settings , but Less important . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , they are less important , but I think they should be there , or not ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , should be there , but not press Yeah , sub-menu , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh I think it's also important to uh make it possible to um how do you call it in English , uh , to not use batteries , and use ac uh bat uh batteries to uh to be yeah yeah sure . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Like with a with a mouse , you have not , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Indeed . 
UNKNOWN So uh you can mount uh the the the uh uh the remote control to um to refill the Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , in a breath it's Charted . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN We should think of the twelve fifty we have but I don't know how much that's going to uh Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but we don't we don't have any costs now , so Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay , because i uh when you get an L_C_D_ screen , you run it on batteries , the batteries will be uh empty very soon , very fast . 
UNKNOWN Yeah e e power supply is one of the most important things . 
UNKNOWN You should Perhaps you should be able to to switch the control off . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN If you have an L_C_D_ screen that's burns all the time I dunno . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN You shouldn't on and off because that's ver extra , that you have t first you have to turn the remote on , and then you can uh I don't know . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Uh And go to standby mode when you don't use it , so that Yeah , automatically . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I think it's it's not that easy because I don't think people will like it who who uh that you have to turn it on first and then use it , so I think it's better when th the T_V_ shuts down , the remote shuts down . 
UNKNOWN Nee that's that's uh yeah . 
UNKNOWN But then you can't Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah yeah au automac matically , that it yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN After two minutes or three minutes , something like that . 
UNKNOWN After two minutes , yeah two three minutes , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And maybe a low battery indicator ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN On the screen . 
CONFIRMATION Sure . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And then b that uh before an hour when its get again gets empty . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Then you have plenty of time to recharge it , of put it in a recharger . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Charger . 
UNKNOWN So we are going for the for the recharger . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , if it's . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFUSION Uh . 
UNKNOWN If it's sensible . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , because when you're watching T_V_ , you're zapping and you have to put it in a recharger , and I don't think it Yeah , okay , but then we have to be sure that the the the the batteries go hours , six hours , five , six hours , then . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , b when the batteries are low But you'll also forget to put it in , because you throw it on the couch and you don't remember . 
UNKNOWN No , when you when you're done with s uh w uh watching your television , you have to put it Yeah sure , of course . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , then you have a problem . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but But you also forget to buy batteries , and then you can you can't use it , so I Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN That's right . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Or we have to be sure that the batteries last couple of days when they're recharged . 
UNKNOWN So . 
UNKNOWN Well I think the batteries should should w should work a lot longer than a couple of days , or not ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah because you have b but you have L_C_D_ screen . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause Yeah , that's right , but Yeah . 
UNKNOWN High power usage . 
UNKNOWN High power user cell , i uh it should be uh a standard move to to put your remote control in the charger when you're done watching television , that's also a a a great advantage because you can't lose it anymore . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN Because you are obliged to uh put it in the charger and not to uh leave it in a couch uh between some cushions . 
UNKNOWN True . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN True . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Yeah , you made a point there . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN But then you also have to s have somewhere where you can put a remo recharger near your couch because otherwise you have to walk a long way when you twoft want to turn on the T_V_ . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , also . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , otherwise all your yeah . 
UNKNOWN Just a small device . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah it hasn't It doesn't have to be big . 
UNKNOWN Plug it in , that's it . 
UNKNOWN I think everything has it for and I guess . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , like a like telephone charger or something . 
UNKNOWN Yeah just just a cable , or a even a a a a a charger where you can mount it on . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Something like that , just u Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
UNKNOWN Okay , well I've Yeah , you have some more points . 
UNKNOWN It has to be easy to use also , or things . 
UNKNOWN Uh market share , speaker re speech recognition . 
UNKNOWN I think . 
UNKNOWN Functional designsuh for the elderly uh you could make it possible to enlarge the screen , so make it possible to not uh display uh a button at ten points uh , or Yeah but it is uh one of the functions you have to uh specify . 
UNKNOWN Also . 
UNKNOWN Well I think that this should be standard . 
UNKNOWN Large button large buttons . 
UNKNOWN Yeah ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Because we can look at uh uh perhaps uh forty buttons at a screen , but the elderly only look at two buttons . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN And you said something about speech recognition ? 
UNKNOWN . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , it says also Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Speech recognition ? 
GREETING Hello . 
UNKNOWN Twelve Euro twelve Euro fifty . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , twelve fifty , twelve fifty . 
UNKNOWN Twelve . 
UNKNOWN That's an also ninety one percent sixteen to twenty five , twenty six to thirty five years , seventy six percent , and thirty six to forty five , thirty five percent . 
UNKNOWN So it's pretty big . 
UNKNOWN Well , spread it by a big market . 
UNKNOWN But then I I I Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Even bigger than for L_C_D_ . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN W I know let's do a speech . 
UNKNOWN Well let's leave out all the remote controls and just put a microphone on top of the television to Yeah Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Ninety . 
UNKNOWN Twenty five . 
UNKNOWN You can clap or something . 
UNKNOWN channel . 
UNKNOWN Turn volume up . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Hey , that that's an idea . 
UNKNOWN Now you shouldn't say the wrong thing , I dunno . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay , well that should it has to be remote control , not Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , twelve . 
UNKNOWN But they want to talk into the remo remote control , or something , or ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Sure why not why not Yeah , mm . 
UNKNOWN Is this only would you would you pay more for speech recognition in a remote control . 
UNKNOWN It's the only thing it says . 
UNKNOWN Oh , but do we want to implement that , or ? 
UNKNOWN I think an L_C_D_ screen should be suf sufficient . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But when you look at the percentages Speech recognition scores even higher , huh ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , it says a lot , but No I think I think it's better to have L_ L_C_D_ screen , because in the area of tw thirty six to forty five , we have about thirty percent of the market share in in our hands , and fifty five of those people want L_C_D_ screen and thirty five want speech recognition . 
UNKNOWN Perhaps the options should be uh Why not ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , well , maybe because of the cost , but uh nobody knows uh how much uh it will cost uh . 
UNKNOWN Why not ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Let's hope uh to have some uh d We should do it . 
UNKNOWN I know Mm . 
UNKNOWN So I think it's better to keep it with L_C_D_ screen . 
UNKNOWN But would it be useful to imple implement both ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , if the costs al allow it . 
UNKNOWN On one remote ? 
UNKNOWN Well I don't know if that can be done with the cost of twelve fifty . 
UNKNOWN Or Yeah , I dunno . 
UNKNOWN Nee . 
UNKNOWN With that uh Yeah , but how would you like to implement that , that you say volume up , and then it goes up , or ? 
UNKNOWN If it should be done , if it could be done , I won't matter . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Sure . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Uh . 
UNKNOWN Certain systems already exist , I think . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Then you also have to have different languages if we go international . 
UNKNOWN Then uh it's y it's yours to do a French and Dutch and English and Yeah , that's right . 
UNKNOWN True . 
UNKNOWN True , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN True . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But that should also be with f should be also with L_C_D_ screen . 
UNKNOWN This should be uh accommodated with some software , uh , uh . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Because then I think in Chinese is different written , volume is different written than um Swahili or something . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Swahili . 
UNKNOWN Yeah you can use icons for the a speaker and uh But if that's better than language for the for the remote . 
UNKNOWN Swahili . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Ja , well possible . 
UNKNOWN Indeed . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah yeah yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So we want to uh yeah it's international uh okay . 
UNKNOWN Then it's Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN 'Kay , what else ? 
UNKNOWN So , no speech recognition ? 
UNKNOWN Or Yeah , and then we have different languages . 
UNKNOWN Well , if it could be done , we Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , we have to keep Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Y it should be done . 
UNKNOWN If it could be done , should be done . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that should be uh anything matters . 
UNKNOWN That's not so difficult at all , because I already use on several voice operated systems , and they are all possible to uh not all , but Yeah , sure , indeed . 
UNKNOWN Okay , just make a separate remote for each uh Okay , so we only do this when we have enough money left . 
UNKNOWN Well , you sh you should to adjust the thing . 
UNKNOWN I think it's difficult . 
UNKNOWN Every language of dialects I think it's very differen difficult . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And you have to speak the so that it can understand . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think it can't be implemented , but maybe Yeah , 's an option , yes . 
UNKNOWN You could use that n as an option , if you have money left , or something . 
UNKNOWN Fifty Euro cents . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Let's do speech . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN For speech recognition . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Well I've written down an an on or off button , volume selection , channel selection , uh the digits from one to zero , huh . 
UNKNOWN Um or from zero to nine . 
UNKNOWN Uh a digits button to switch uh between one and two digits , mute button , a separate menu for teletext , a battery indicator . 
UNKNOWN Um we're going to use a docking station and uh probably L_C_D_ and if there's enough money , speech recognition . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN And uh the possibility to uh enlarge buttons or to have large buttons in general . 
UNKNOWN Mm , yes . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I With uh teletext if it wasn't ver very important , it was but You also now have colours . 
UNKNOWN No , but Curved ? 
UNKNOWN I don't know if we should implement that . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , when you press the red button , you go to pageone hundred two , and when you press the I don't know if we should implement that , because it says that teletext not really important , but yeah , the shortcut , and you can't go to sport . 
UNKNOWN Uh yeah . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN S Shortcuts . 
CONFUSION Uh . 
UNKNOWN I think we should we could that we could also implement a audio settings , screen settings and channel settings , but as sub-menus . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN D Mainly if you turn the uh remote control on , you have to u you have to see from one till zero , channel and volume . 
UNKNOWN And if you want to use teletext screen or audio , then you can press it . 
UNKNOWN Sh Yeah , just just sub-menu . 
UNKNOWN It should be available but not not Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause it should be there . 
UNKNOWN Not directly uh available . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so not too much teletext support , but in a separate menu , and Okay , but no more buttons or functions , or ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN So actually it is there but it's just not r ready there . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but s Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Directly available . 
UNKNOWN So does it confuse uh the user ? 
UNKNOWN You'll have to search for it . 
UNKNOWN They'd have to be easy to use . 
CONFUSION Uh . 
UNKNOWN I'll search um . 
UNKNOWN If you want to use teletext , you can push the teletext button and then the options uh become available . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's a I guess not . 
UNKNOWN The sign of it . 
UNKNOWN Uh , no . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN What else can you do with a television ? 
UNKNOWN We've got anon Have got got two examples here , but I don't think there's anything we're missing . 
UNKNOWN Aren't we forgetting something very important ? 
UNKNOWN Uh play , pause , doesn't n need to be there . 
UNKNOWN Well , we don't have the video orders Yeah , you could look here all the the Uh th th th th I don't know , technical functions . 
UNKNOWN Yes , so this is your presentation. 
UNKNOWN We could check the other remote controls with technical functions . 
UNKNOWN Which ones were yours ? 
UNKNOWN Techni Ja ja ja ja ja . 
UNKNOWN They're a bit small , you can we should stretch them , because I guess we've got them all . 
UNKNOWN Ping . 
UNKNOWN Technical functions . 
UNKNOWN Yeah okay . 
UNKNOWN Uh I think I go to have volume , mute but I Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Very slow . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , the zoom buttons . 
UNKNOWN And for a T_V_ ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , b wide screen , high screen , different things you have , yeah different uh Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Can you zoom in a T_V_ ? 
UNKNOWN Or that you can put 'em on uh on on wide and yeah . 
UNKNOWN But that should also be a sub then , a sub uh menu thing . 
UNKNOWN Menu . 
UNKNOWN Yeah it should be available , but then in separate screen settings or something . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , so we should also implement se screen settings . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , screen settings , audio settings , teletext settings you have . 
UNKNOWN Oh right . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Channel settings . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , so you can program the Yeah , so the first you see the main , and the other ones you can uh go to uh Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So those four , and of course the main . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Like tap screens or something or , I dunno . 
UNKNOWN Something Yeah , if uh No , you don't yu a no you then you don't no ni don't then you don't use it . 
UNKNOWN I hope we can do this . 
UNKNOWN There are a lot of options depending uh on what kind of television you got . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause if you don't got a wide screen television you don't need the uh the screen settings uh for uh Yeah and if the television does not support such uh operations Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN We don't have to use that top . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So you leave it alone . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Or it could be possible to have a a standard version of the remote , an expanded version . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And do we want them in different colours , or And and the buttons , should they have colours ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Colours . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Colours I think the main colour of the remote control is uh the colour of the L_C_D_ screen . 
UNKNOWN Oh but we don't have any buttons . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I Because we don't want a lot a devi yeah a device self s g Okay , so use uh very uh lot of peo Adjust with phones , yes Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , then defines itself . 
UNKNOWN Because uh how many percent ? 
UNKNOWN Eighty percent ? 
UNKNOWN They think it's ugly , right ? 
UNKNOWN Would spend more money if it looks fancy . 
UNKNOWN Perhaps you can uh make adjustable fronts , like with the telephones . 
UNKNOWN You can uh But I don't think that uh Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Twelve Euro fifty . 
UNKNOWN Well , make it available in different colours , you mean ? 
CONFIRMATION Sure . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Red , white , blue , black . 
UNKNOWN Rasta colours . 
UNKNOWN And a see-through uh Okay , well that's the signal for las final five minutes . 
UNKNOWN Grey . 
UNKNOWN Yeah sea view , yes , Simpson's versions and Leave . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , see through version . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN If you press a button , it turns green . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN A disco version . 
UNKNOWN Five minutes ? 
UNKNOWN Um so I have uh the things I just read . 
UNKNOWN Um then we have uh separate menus for teletext , screen settings , audio settings , and what else ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Channel settings ? 
UNKNOWN Oh yeah , right . 
UNKNOWN Channel settings . 
UNKNOWN So you can program the T_V_ . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Perhaps you should you'd throw them on on in one pile . 
UNKNOWN So , options , and then you sub them . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Otherwise you have all those teletext , perhaps teletext not , but Yeah , but I Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Could be possible . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Or like uh you have a menu button , you press Yeah , or otherwise you have a menu button , press menu then you have uh main uh menu search uh all the all the settings . 
UNKNOWN No , we said teletext also a separate menu . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay , but we can work that out later , I guess . 
UNKNOWN But I don't know . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , no problem . 
UNKNOWN So we're having a a general menu with the most used functions , uh teletext , screen settings , audio settings , channel settings , and maybe there are options for the remote itself ? 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN Like uh large icons or small icons and I don't know what else , but Yeah , but on the L_C_D_ , huh ? 
UNKNOWN Um , I think b because we don't have a lot of buttons on the one screen , I think the buttons Yeah , but but or like you have you only have channel button or volume button . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN Or do we have any buttons ? 
UNKNOWN On the remote . 
UNKNOWN Which one ? 
UNKNOWN Those buttons you can you can Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But that's also in the L_C_D_ , right ? 
UNKNOWN Right , yeah , okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , th No , no normal buttons , yeah . 
UNKNOWN So we don't have any normal buttons that uh No , alright . 
UNKNOWN Maybe only the on and o on and off button . 
UNKNOWN Yet on and off is p is perhaps you kno No , no . 
UNKNOWN But we don't need a special we don't need a special options menu for the remote itself . 
UNKNOWN Uh not button Yeah sure , of course you need uh a settings button , uh or a settings option for the remote control . 
UNKNOWN But I don't think Mm , no . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Oh well , you should be able to set which T_V_ you have . 
UNKNOWN If you have if you have uh Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But isn't idea to use uh uh what you said , uh normal on and off button for the T_V_ , that you don't have to use a Yeah but but not for the remote but for the T_V_ , that you use But a not as normal button , in the L_C_D_ , yeah . 
UNKNOWN No no no , because we we discussed that you could charge it , otherwise is it it jumps to stand-by mode automatically . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but a T_V_ of course , th that's the I think that's a best thing is that to implement that one in the menu with the volume and channel . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN Well maybe there should be a separate button apart from the L_C_D_ , because you can't turn it on when the L_C_D_ is off . 
UNKNOWN So how do you turn the thing on ? 
UNKNOWN There has to be a on button on the remote , huh ? 
UNKNOWN No you just tap I think . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , you tap . 
UNKNOWN Just tap it . 
UNKNOWN Touch screen , yeah then it's turn turn off , turn on . 
UNKNOWN Tap the thing . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN And then the television is on also , or just the remote ? 
UNKNOWN No , just the remote . 
UNKNOWN A television don't have to be on , that one you can press on , yeah stand-by , then press on remote , press on and then T_V_ should be available . 
CONFIRMATION Sure . 
UNKNOWN But Yeah a yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , it should be in standby mode , but A A A normal button on the remote control , or norm ? 
UNKNOWN Or not . 
UNKNOWN I don't know whether it's handy to have a n a normal on button , a r just uh rubber uh for for T_V_ , so you can turn it on and then you can choose the channel . 
UNKNOWN Separate . 
UNKNOWN Otherwise you I don't know whether or not that's Yeah , yeah . 
UNKNOWN To turn it on . 
UNKNOWN Of or you should put it in the L_C_D_ screen . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , because uh when you touch the L_C_D_ screen when it is in standby mode , it should pop on . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I have , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay , well Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Wh uh why would it be a a need to have a normal button ? 
UNKNOWN Well I I guess if you use the L_C_D_ screen , you first have to search where is the on button , then you uh you you then turn it , and then the T_V_ goes on . 
UNKNOWN But if you have a normal on button on the on the remote , then you do the on , and then you search the channel which you want . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but I think the re the remote control , if you press tap the screen , it always should jump to the screen which has the volume button , channel button , and of course of also the on and off button . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Oh right . 
UNKNOWN I think it looks a lot more fancy if you use uh if you don't have any buttons on the s on on remote control . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I think so too . 
UNKNOWN Otherwise y wet e k Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So actually we're going to create a a button-less uh remote . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN No buttons at all . 
UNKNOWN Okay , well that's might be a unique selling point , huh for a remote . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN If we can afford it . 
UNKNOWN Okay , well I guess we have to postpone further discussion to uh our next meeting , because we're running out of time . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , if we can afford it . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Oh , okay Oh . 
UNKNOWN Um for now , we're having a lunch break , and then there will be uh half an hour for the uh next share of individual work . 
UNKNOWN I will uh write uh minutes, if I can create them out of this . 
UNKNOWN And uh put them in the the project documentsuh folder . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN And here are the individual actions for the for the other roles . 
UNKNOWN And of course specific instructions will be sent to you again by your uh personal coach . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
UNKNOWN Luckily as we are . 
UNKNOWN Okay , well thank you very much , for now , and uh have a nice lunch , huh ? 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Lunch . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Food . 
UNKNOWN Should we put this back in our rooms , or uh ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , think so . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay , welcome everyone to our next meeting . 
UNKNOWN I'm busy writing and busy leading the meeting , but um I've prepared a little presentationonce again um or at least an agendaI think uh the biggest part of the presentationwill be uh on your side . 
UNKNOWN Um we are here at the conceptual design meeting , which is hereby opened . 
UNKNOWN Um once again I will try to uh write some minuteswhich I just from the previous meeting uh placed inside our project folder , which was quite some typing . 
UNKNOWN Um today we once again have uh three presentations, if I'm right , and after that we will take a decision on the remote control concepts . 
UNKNOWN And just as the last time we have forty minutes to accomplish that . 
UNKNOWN Okay , well I'd say let's start with the first presentation. 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN Um in the same order as last time ? 
UNKNOWN W sure . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
UNKNOWN Well , take it away . 
UNKNOWN Okay uh welcome you all . 
UNKNOWN Components design , um uh first of all uh I would like to uh uh accommodate some of those uh things I uh uh elaborate some of the things I did . 
UNKNOWN I I elaborated on the concept . 
UNKNOWN What should be um uh said about uh the components , uh its properties and what kind of materials should we use to uh to make uh one of those r remote controls . 
UNKNOWN Uh well first of all I've uh d subtracted some of the components that is that are used uh are w w um you know from what uh the remote control's formed . 
UNKNOWN Uh first of all , the case , the case , the surrounding of the of the the remote control . 
UNKNOWN I would like to uh give you an idea of uh how I thought about . 
UNKNOWN Don't destroy my giraffe . 
UNKNOWN Giraffe's gone now . 
UNKNOWN Okay um the case was is made from rubber , I suppose . 
UNKNOWN There's one of the because when you use a remote control a lot of people uh will uh will uh drop their remote control and they break uh becau the uh titanium was also an option . 
UNKNOWN Drop it . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN But uh it's a very expensive material . 
UNKNOWN Uh rubber is , I think , uh the best suitable uh material uh to use uh for our uh for our remote control . 
UNKNOWN Um it's poss it's also possible to uh create fancy colours with rubber . 
UNKNOWN Uh rubber l makes it easy to uh to to it lets lets itself colour . 
UNKNOWN Uh titanium uh you have to paint it and with that uh it's possible to scratch it or uh yeah make it ugly . 
UNKNOWN Uh rubber uh the total uh piece of rubber that's sor uh that's that's used uh to make the case is uh the same colour , so if you scratch it it's still the same colour , perhaps uh it's a little bit damaged . 
UNKNOWN But it's a very strong material . 
UNKNOWN Um I h I had an idea single covered uh curved , sorry , single curved . 
UNKNOWN Uh so it's t two dimensional . 
UNKNOWN I think it's uh it's best to drawoh green . 
UNKNOWN It's a colour . 
UNKNOWN Bright colour . 
UNKNOWN Uh New . 
UNKNOWN Fancy colour . 
UNKNOWN Forward . 
UNKNOWN Blank . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN You have to go t Oh it's a side view . 
UNKNOWN Let's make it uh black . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN I thought of an idea like this . 
UNKNOWN Oh that . 
UNKNOWN Um delete . 
UNKNOWN Blank . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So it also looks nice when it's on your table . 
UNKNOWN So you get uh it doesn't lay flat down on the table , but it's c it's stands . 
UNKNOWN Side view yes it's side view so uh I I'm not technically good at th three D_ modelling , but . 
UNKNOWN Um uh it's just an idea I had so it's uh it's very uh so its also looks nice when it's on the table . 
UNKNOWN Um the graphical user interface and the buttons , uh we also thought about that already . 
UNKNOWN Uh I thought about uh the L_C_D_ touch screen , which is uh is easy to clean too . 
UNKNOWN One of the great uh advantages of the L_C_D_ screen you just use some or uh another uh cleaning uh uh cl some cleaning stuff . 
UNKNOWN And um it should be made of strong plastic and it should be bright . 
UNKNOWN Well I already uh s uh explained some properties of that material and I think uh well we also we almost concluded about that uh this should uh be uh our uh button component . 
UNKNOWN True . 
UNKNOWN So uh uh that's all about uh the buttons . 
UNKNOWN Uh the batteries , uh we also thought about that already , uh will be chargeable with uh uh an option for a mount station so you can uh put the uh the remote control in a mount station so its charges itself up instead of uh plugging it in or something like that . 
UNKNOWN Questions , ? 
UNKNOWN No no no no no . 
NEGATION No . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Just looking . 
UNKNOWN And they should be long lasting , not uh not be empty uh in about uh two minutes or uh thirty minutes or forty minutes of use . 
UNKNOWN And next step is the chip uh th the component that's uh makes or transmits the signal to the television . 
UNKNOWN Uh there was an option to use s a rather simple chip but I think uh because uh of our uh highly uh requiring uh requirements , there should be an advanced chip in it with uh also the ability to uh facilitate speaker speech recognition uh which unfortunately is still in a test phase , so uh there should be some more uh investigation on that side . 
UNKNOWN Uh my personal preferences uh I also overheard in the last meeting that there shou we should use uh our own business colours . 
UNKNOWN That was correct , wasn't it ? 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN I think they are rather boring for um for use with rubber . 
UNKNOWN Well , business colours I thought it was the the slogan and uh the corporate image , so yeah , it needs colour , but I don't think you have to make the entire thing in the corporate colour . 
UNKNOWN Okay they should be m sh they should be in mind , wasn't it ? 
UNKNOWN Okay so it d it doesn't says uh to uh have the slogan ? 
UNKNOWN It must be recognisable . 
UNKNOWN Okay okay . 
UNKNOWN Well that's possible of course . 
UNKNOWN We could make a little R_ and R_ on the top of the machine . 
UNKNOWN You can put the R_ and R_ . 
UNKNOWN Uh so they are pretty boring , I suggest , because just the availability with rubber to make fantastic colours uh and also in a lot of possible colours , so it's possible to make very uh fancy uh remote controls which peopl uh who people in which people will find they're uh interesting . 
UNKNOWN And uh will buy uh them faster when they look at the same old grey or black uh colours . 
UNKNOWN Uh s as I said uh before rubber is uh is impossible to damage severely imp instead of uh of course you can break it when you you when you break it in s for example with a pair of scissors or something like that , but i if you drop it it's not uh broken uh right away s instead of using uh plastic , hard plastic or uh titanium . 
UNKNOWN And I personally liked uh the single curved uh remote control , because it yeah it makes sense . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Well that's all about my uh my findings . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
CONFIRMATION Okay , thank you . 
UNKNOWN Mm mm mm . 
UNKNOWN I will go next . 
UNKNOWN Next . 
UNKNOWN Alright so I thought a little bit about the interface . 
UNKNOWN Uh how it should look . 
UNKNOWN And uh uh we uh determined that will not be no buttons , but only an L_C_D_ screen , so I had to uh look on that . 
UNKNOWN And the design is therefore based on what we just uh uh thought of . 
UNKNOWN Uh first there are some new findings and new technology for speech recognition . 
UNKNOWN And this is that uh um uh uh you you ask you give a question through through the device and it answers you . 
UNKNOWN And they already uh put this in an in a coffee maker . 
UNKNOWN And so that it you say uh good morning , uh coffee maker , and it says t says to you back good morning Joe or what's your name . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN This uh and there's an easy way to uh program that uh you say record into the device into the speaker and then you say the question and three seconds later you say the answer and then when you say the question it gives you the answer . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Um perhaps it's useful , perhaps for because people um lose the remote , they can yell uh remote where are you and calls or something . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN It's true . 
UNKNOWN And perhaps we could uh implement that . 
UNKNOWN And then I have to go out of the presentationbecause I tried to make some kind of a a idea of how it should look like but I can't draw, so uh don't make too much of it . 
UNKNOWN Oh my God . 
UNKNOWN I tried to uh the L_C_D_ screen I tried to sort of to draw. 
UNKNOWN I thought uh at least uh the icon for the volume . 
UNKNOWN I don't know if there is an icon for the program , but yeah . 
UNKNOWN Not just a P_ . 
UNKNOWN P_ yeah , just a P_ . 
UNKNOWN Oh okay . 
UNKNOWN So uh and then the buttons above and uh below the and the and the mute button also recognisable as an icon . 
UNKNOWN .. . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Where's where's the button for two ? 
UNKNOWN I forgot that one . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN I thought I forgot something , but uh . 
UNKNOWN And uh and uh the numbers , that should be a bit larger I think it's not really on scale and and so forth . 
UNKNOWN Ah . 
UNKNOWN Doesn't matter . 
UNKNOWN Um an options button . 
UNKNOWN And I thought the the button for teletext apar uh apart because it's not really options , I think . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN It's uh options is the settings of the remote and of the T_V_ and that kind of uh thing . 
NEGATION No . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN So could call it settings or something . 
UNKNOWN But this is a bit uh how I thought it . 
UNKNOWN And uh the L_C_D_ uh somewhere on the remote . 
UNKNOWN Perhaps we could be more curvy the remote perhaps should , so that it's better in your hand or something uh . 
UNKNOWN Oh okay , yeah . 
UNKNOWN But uh and and uh a microph microphone for the speech uh recognition if we want to implement that . 
UNKNOWN Uh and then uh if you press the op options button , now we have an example of and then you should get the other options with what what you could do and that you could do with something like this this . 
UNKNOWN Oh yeah , . 
UNKNOWN And uh it's also uh I thought think we discussed uh earlier that uh older people don't really want to use uh these extra settings . 
UNKNOWN And older people a also don't really want to use this uh th this kind of option menus . 
UNKNOWN So they want to u use one button and then something happens , and not choose with uh this kind of uh And you could put in a an a really s little scrolling device on the side of your uh remote , so you could scroll scroll uh across these uh things . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN That's an option . 
UNKNOWN And that was my uh finding dinge . 
CONFIRMATION Thanks . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Now our third team member with his presentation. 
UNKNOWN Go Danny , go Danny . 
UNKNOWN Okay , I'm going to tell you something about a trend watching . 
UNKNOWN The trends from the past years , what the people like , what the youngsters like , what the elderly people liked about shapes , colours , material and stuff . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN The method I used was Like I told I watched the trends from the past years about colours , shapes , material they wanted uh from elderly and young people . 
UNKNOWN So we can keep that in mind for designing f uh the device itself . 
UNKNOWN Findings I made . 
UNKNOWN The most important thing people liked last year was that the remote control should be look look fancy . 
UNKNOWN The second important thing that w should be if inv in innov innovative , okay , like the L_C_D_ screen that's quite innovative so that should be great meeting for this . 
UNKNOWN And the third thing is it should be easy to use . 
UNKNOWN I think with only one menu , four button , channel , volume , it should also be enough for easy to use . 
UNKNOWN The personal preferences for the young people , they liked fruity colours like uh banana yellow , uh strawberry red and stuff . 
UNKNOWN Fruity ? 
UNKNOWN Fruity . 
UNKNOWN Grass green . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Like that . 
UNKNOWN The round shapes , and soft material m materials like the rubber . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN It should be soft uh i it should feeling spongy or s Sponge Bob like things . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Let's build it into a sponge . 
UNKNOWN Th Elderly people like au colours which y are being seen in autumn like um woods um dark brown , red , deep reds and stuff . 
UNKNOWN They liked square shapes with round edges . 
UNKNOWN And hard materials like wood , um titanium . 
UNKNOWN They those kind of materials they liked . 
UNKNOWN This is a bit like the young peoples like the fruity colours , innovative , all the colours you see , the blue , the red , the white , the yellow , that stuff . 
UNKNOWN And then I th I I personally thought the front side of the shape should be something for the youngsters like like this or something . 
UNKNOWN Oh y So for the older people , a more traditional uh form . 
UNKNOWN It's it's a bit like a banana . 
UNKNOWN And the colour should be yellow , or something . 
UNKNOWN And for the elderly people just plain old . 
UNKNOWN Because we decided to have two kind of remotes , two designs, or was it two colours ? 
UNKNOWN It was one remote , I think , different colours . 
UNKNOWN Different colours , yeah . 
UNKNOWN We should decide whether it's going to be with round shapes . 
UNKNOWN I think like my colleague , you said , is that's e better , or for the elderly people something like like the iPod or something , with round squares . 
UNKNOWN Simple but easy to use . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN So that's it . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN That is my Yeah , like the older o older colours I can maybe Yeah . 
UNKNOWN You could you could uh change the colours , that was also the idea . 
UNKNOWN I don't know which shape you should should take , but . 
UNKNOWN Colours th the elderly people Uh Look something like that . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I guess changing colours will be easier than changing uh the shape of it . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Changing just the shape of the uh remote control ? 
UNKNOWN Perhaps you could find something in the middle . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , s round corners , but s but square , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Round but square . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But maybe then both groups won't buy it . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh i i if you do it uh uh square , with round corners but a little uh in the middle of it uh i Do you know what I mean ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah I know what you mean , kind of like a . 
UNKNOWN wait , like like this uh a bit . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So it's a bit square , but it's also a bit uh round . 
UNKNOWN Kinda like a beer glass . 
UNKNOWN So but then Same sides . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I know what you mean . 
UNKNOWN It's also easy to to have to to put in your hand . 
UNKNOWN But that's uh Yeah but that's also how other remotes are shaped , so that's uh But perhaps that's a good thing , so that's easy to use . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN People know the Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Will recognise that's as a remote control . 
UNKNOWN Uh when I saw your d Oh . 
UNKNOWN Autumn colours like red , brown . 
UNKNOWN They liked the wood a lot . 
UNKNOWN Huh . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So maybe we could give it like wooden loo look look or something in that colour . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , kinda like old cars , uh Let's put it all together . 
UNKNOWN And a bit bit old school style renaissance , medieval kind of things . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Swords . 
UNKNOWN Those kind of Yeah , those kind of things . 
UNKNOWN So you see the big difference between the young people ? 
UNKNOWN Fresh , exciting . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And the old people , old and boring . 
UNKNOWN But that's easily to do with the colour , I think . 
UNKNOWN So Sorry ? 
UNKNOWN That's easy to do with the colours , I think . 
UNKNOWN Yeah I think it's it's easier to do in colour than in shape . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Uh . 
UNKNOWN Because otherwise we have to get different shapes , and colour way easier than yeah the shapes . 
UNKNOWN Yeah we think so too . 
UNKNOWN In material yeah rubber , rubber is , like I said , young people like more soft materials and spongy ones and the old people like plain wood . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So we have to decide if we're going to use real hard rubber , or soft rubber . 
UNKNOWN Yeah think uh Also in between . 
UNKNOWN Or something something between that . 
UNKNOWN Soft rubber . 
UNKNOWN Yeah soft rubber which you can you can feel in it . 
UNKNOWN Yeah I know what you Um . 
UNKNOWN I don't think you should be able to mould it , but Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Or No . 
UNKNOWN Or or wh what's something harder . 
UNKNOWN It should shouldn't be . 
UNKNOWN No no no but but you have to like like like a a eraser or something . 
UNKNOWN That's the bit you can press it in , or something harder . 
CONFUSION Uh . 
UNKNOWN Bit like this kind of rubber . 
UNKNOWN This uh But it's quite hard , this . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , something like this , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah it's quite hard but you can press it in . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It's feels kind s spongy . 
UNKNOWN Spongy . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Something . 
UNKNOWN I don't think it's rubber . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN N n n Are you going to invite Sponge Bob , maybe he can Yeah I think that's the better thing to do . 
UNKNOWN So we need a spongy feeling . 
UNKNOWN Uh did you have something about uh So we should first decide about shape , I think . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Ding ding . 
UNKNOWN Which uh Then you can fit the L_C_D_ screen in it , and can decide uh . 
UNKNOWN Um I also s uh can't help but notice that you uh used an you had a remote control and the L_C_D_ screen was uh rather small . 
UNKNOWN Yeah w I think that L_C_D_ screen should be like Yeah three quarter of the of the Yeah the buttons won't get that small when the L_C_D_ screen is Mm-hmm . 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN Yeah it it's supposed to be bit s bit s bit Yeah . 
UNKNOWN .. . 
UNKNOWN This was your size , but I think it should be larger . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , three quarters . 
UNKNOWN So uh so you don't have to put your oh . 
UNKNOWN Uh new , blank . 
UNKNOWN So uh when you get this uh Uh kinda like this . 
UNKNOWN Ooh Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Or should it be larger ? 
UNKNOWN Larger I think . 
UNKNOWN Larger ? 
UNKNOWN Because you want to put your hands You want Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But if you pu Now you can put your hand there and then you won't touch the screen . 
UNKNOWN Yeah becau because you have Yeah okay , true , true , true true . 
UNKNOWN Perhaps that's best . 
UNKNOWN Your thumb here . 
UNKNOWN But not on the screen because Yeah that's uh that's an idea . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Looks a bit like a Game Boy now . 
UNKNOWN Because when you put your f Yeah but if yo if you make the the L_C_D_ screen as large as the remote control itself , uh you'll you'll always get some You Yeah . 
UNKNOWN You always touch it , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah yeah yeah yeah . 
UNKNOWN Going to be very greasy and stuff . 
UNKNOWN But it won't get that small because you have how much ? 
UNKNOWN Nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen buttons on the screen . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN One to zero , the two digit , You have to you have to Because some fat people with d thick fingers will press three buttons at same time . 
UNKNOWN Yeah you don't want it too small . 
UNKNOWN How yeah how large Yeah they have thick fingers . 
UNKNOWN But if you wanna make it in international , Japanese uh people got uh rather small hands and we got these large Zoom opt Ah yeah of course , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah true , but Yeah , we have we have the zoom option , right ? 
UNKNOWN You can make it larger to to uh to uh with accompanying uh greater fields to push the button . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And we won't include a a pen , or something to point , hey , we we want to do it with our fingers , right ? 
NEGATION No . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Your fingers , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN You don't want uh Because if you lose the pen uh if you lose the pen uh you can't use Yeah You can do whatever uh any uh cloth . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Y you could include a pen . 
UNKNOWN Use a pen You you c you can lose the pen . 
UNKNOWN Yeah but I think people want to use a remote with with their fingers because th they're used to that and And maybe we have to add a tissue to remove the grease from all the fingers , huh . 
UNKNOWN Yeah the fingers , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah o yeah , if they think it's handy to use a pen . 
UNKNOWN Yeah I think this uh this is a good size for the screen . 
UNKNOWN I don't know how how large the actual remote should be but a little bit like this , or something . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah but that that can be with plain soft tissue . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , you can buy those at Maybe it's better to to include rechargeable batteries which you can recharge through the docking station . 
UNKNOWN Okay well maybe , if I can interrupt you , maybe I should uh should show some points on which we uh should take a decision . 
CONFIRMATION Sure . 
UNKNOWN So we can discuss these points . 
UNKNOWN those points um energy question mark . 
UNKNOWN How how should we uh supply the thing with energy and how are we going to do it with separate docking station and then put in it . 
UNKNOWN Uh chip on printand case . 
UNKNOWN Those are points my uh coach advised me to discuss here , but I hope you have ideas about them . 
UNKNOWN I think energy were batteries and then uh and uh Yeah . 
UNKNOWN The docking station . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So that's the the the first point . 
UNKNOWN We already decided that on the previous meeting . 
UNKNOWN W Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So if the badg the batteries are dead then you can re you can uh change them . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Just like with the telephone . 
UNKNOWN I kinda like your Yeah you got some uh some of those uh uh wireless uh mice ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah yeah yeah like those . 
UNKNOWN Mouse . 
UNKNOWN Computer mouse . 
UNKNOWN Kinda like those kind of batteries . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN but it should be th I think normal batteries , not not like two or two uh Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , normal plain you No normal plain batteries you can buy at the supermarket or retail shop . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Simple rechargeable uh batteries . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um what was with the chip on print? 
UNKNOWN The chip on print? 
UNKNOWN Um Uh you gotta f Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think so . 
UNKNOWN Chip on printwith a with a simple uh a sim not a simple but a We also discussed that . 
UNKNOWN Printplate . 
UNKNOWN Didn't we ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah but how did this how does that with a L_C_D_ screen ? 
UNKNOWN You still have a printplate . 
UNKNOWN Uh Beg your pardon ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah yeah yeah . 
UNKNOWN You always have a printplate . 
UNKNOWN You always have a printplate , right ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah sure , of course , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Always , so I dunno what w what we have to decide about that . 
UNKNOWN Yeah well it's a good question . 
UNKNOWN It just was in there and I didn't have any information about it , but Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Well uh chip on print, I think what they mean uh with the regular rubber buttons that you got , uh it's always clear for the remote control when you press uh a certain button . 
UNKNOWN But when you got a L_C_D_ screen , with no uh with not the buttons are not always on the same place , for example if you enlarge a button , or if you got several options uh appearing on your screen , uh the co-ordinations aren't always the same . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , okay . 
UNKNOWN But Yeah okay , but the p printplate of L_ L_C_D_ screen is more advanced than a normal printplate , so that that's not of any discussion , I think . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN When you got a regular button , th the button of stand-by is always on the same place and you got on the and on the Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well you need some kind of C_P_U_ , I guess . 
UNKNOWN I suppose so . 
UNKNOWN Mm , I don't I dunno I don't think that's Yeah yeah okay but I d I I don't know if nor o s it's quite a simple L_C_D_ . 
UNKNOWN It is a simple C_P_U_ but it doesn't Yeah because it has to uh b Yeah but it the the remote control has to know whether you're in a settings menu or just uh you just want to turn up the volume . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , it's quite a simple L_C_D_ screen . 
UNKNOWN I think they don't need that big of C_P_U_ . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , okay , true true . 
UNKNOWN True . 
UNKNOWN So it has to have some kind of a calculation unit or C_P_U_ to know uh in which state you are and uh which button you are pressing in at the right moment . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Because we're projecting projecting the buttons on the L_C_D_ screen . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And a touch screen makes it uh possible to uh to get the co-ordination of your finger on the screen . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And the case , yeah we already discussed the case , we wanted to make it from rubber and uh Uh hard rubber I think . 
UNKNOWN It's rubber . 
UNKNOWN Yeah but but a hard rubber like this ? 
UNKNOWN Or softer rubber or Yeah . 
UNKNOWN That's the easy to ha uh to to uh Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It bounces back from the floor where you throw it . 
UNKNOWN Yeah sure , look . 
UNKNOWN We have different colours . 
UNKNOWN Yeah yeah this in different colours ? 
UNKNOWN So the shapes is something between the square shapes with round colo corners and a round shapes ? 
UNKNOWN D It's our main target . 
UNKNOWN No I don't think , I think it's more round than square . 
UNKNOWN Yeah it's a bit . 
UNKNOWN But I think it should be a bit longer , perhaps . 
UNKNOWN So it meets I think it meets more the young people than the older people . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But that's what we want , . 
UNKNOWN I think so too . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's our target . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Lower than forty years , I think it was . 
UNKNOWN Well and how about my idea uh of making it um with one single curve ? 
UNKNOWN Oh yeah that that I think I thought that was a quite good Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So i Because it's a gadget and you want to show it off , of course . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah yeah you have a fancy design , then , right away . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Uh . 
UNKNOWN You can put it on your table with the L_C_D_ screen , you don't have to put it get it in your hand , you can put it next to you and then dive it in and . 
UNKNOWN So Okay so Yeah but I wrote it down . 
UNKNOWN Because it Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's a good idea . 
UNKNOWN It's a lot easier . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , alright . 
UNKNOWN So You can't you You can't oh , you c you can drawit on your paperand then load it on the And load it on the the user the server . 
UNKNOWN So , so you got uh Did you write that down ? 
UNKNOWN And then Yeah , you can uh It's pretty easy but And Yeah , I had what I just uh I should again . 
UNKNOWN Uh got a single curved uh rubber f uh fancy coloured remote control . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN What about the user interface , there are also some some questions uh about the concepts I think you have some ideas on that . 
UNKNOWN You you showed your drawing. 
UNKNOWN I miss a few buttons , but . 
UNKNOWN Well . 
UNKNOWN At least uh what we should also have on , I just remembered , um a menu to go back through the first uh if if you touch options , you can't go back to this uh right away now . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , you have to go back . 
UNKNOWN Yeah uh uh . 
UNKNOWN This I don't know . 
UNKNOWN Isn't it better to have the sound and the general buttons horizontal ? 
UNKNOWN With the minus and the plus . 
UNKNOWN I think it's I don't know . 
UNKNOWN I think it's easier than Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I I thought it was uh easier to handle this way , but I don't know what they think . 
CONFUSION Sorry ? 
UNKNOWN Would you like the the buttons horizontal or v vertical ? 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN For sound and channel . 
UNKNOWN Depends on the screen . 
UNKNOWN Th Right well if we make it like this , I think if you put it like this Yeah . 
UNKNOWN If you make the screen vertical it doesn't matter . 
UNKNOWN If you make it uh in a rectangle I so it's it's it's it's Square . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think it's it's easier to have it something like Oh a button uh minus here , plus over here . 
UNKNOWN A minus here , plus over here . 
CONFIRMATION Oh , okay . 
UNKNOWN And on here . 
UNKNOWN The other buttons and on here the top . 
UNKNOWN The options and then you have something like uh the P_ over here , and the sound . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But I think I wou I think that's a matter of what you're used to . 
UNKNOWN Something uh Something like Sh Plus minus plus uh minus . 
UNKNOWN I think I would put a plus and a min uh here . 
UNKNOWN And then the P_ in the mid in the middle and the sound uh in the middle . 
CONFUSION Uh . 
UNKNOWN Take your time . 
UNKNOWN Almost . 
UNKNOWN Yeah but I think when you are holding it , you could press the minus and the plus and with the other finger the minus and the plus . 
UNKNOWN Yeah I think you're going to s you're going to use it with one thumb . 
UNKNOWN Yeah but I think Yeah I don't know . 
UNKNOWN Perhaps I have some examples . 
UNKNOWN W We'll leave that to the usability engineering then . 
UNKNOWN I don't know That's me . 
UNKNOWN Who's the usability engineering ? 
UNKNOWN She is . 
UNKNOWN But I'm going to look if I've got some examples 'cause perhaps you should choose what's most often used . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN The 'Cause they can use that better . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um Oh I have that those s numbers . 
UNKNOWN Consistency . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I Here is our here are uh I don't really know . 
UNKNOWN Or a good watch . 
UNKNOWN B Channel selection . 
UNKNOWN Everybody's searching in his data . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Per hour one hundred and sixty eight . 
UNKNOWN Volume selection four times an hour Uh Yeah , that depends on on on the remote . 
UNKNOWN Yeah but But I mean if it's usually plus or min above each other or next to each other on a normal remote . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So not how much n not how often it's used , but Uh . 
UNKNOWN W what's what's usual or normal . 
UNKNOWN Yes I'm looking here . 
UNKNOWN But here's it's below , here also , and now here's here's next to each other . 
UNKNOWN I think it's it's a Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think because I have two televisions at home . 
UNKNOWN One is horizontal , one is vertical , so it depends . 
UNKNOWN Yeah it does it doesn't really matter , but Uh . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Depends . 
UNKNOWN I think the the the volume was usually uh above each other , because you go higher and down . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , lower . 
UNKNOWN And the the pay the the the program is next to each other , because you would go further and back . 
UNKNOWN True . 
UNKNOWN That's how it's is usually when I look here that's what I see . 
UNKNOWN Okay , um . 
UNKNOWN Let's cut to the chase . 
UNKNOWN It's got to change . 
UNKNOWN Yeah well I think we have we don't have to decide about that now how where we will put the buttons just the concepts . 
UNKNOWN I don't know . 
UNKNOWN Yeah is it is user interface . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Component . 
UNKNOWN This concept is in the actual design , but you should know where you would place a And the speech uh shall we implement that ? 
UNKNOWN Okay , well le Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Interface , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Or uh Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah well we just heard about the new uh technology , huh ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah I think it's it's easy for that , where are you , but then it says I'm here . 
UNKNOWN Technologies , uh . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Makes it possible to Mm . 
UNKNOWN But then you should also find a place You could if you do it like this you could put it in a corner or something . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN You can talk into the corner . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , a microphone , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Not even necessary , because a lotta you can make a very sensitive microphone , so it makes it possible to uh just put it arou uh underneath it or on the on the bottom of the uh remote . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah maybe at the bottom where you can can hel hold it with you hand that there's also a microphone uh over there . 
UNKNOWN But Yeah , that's also . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN So , in the middle or something . 
UNKNOWN But that's not import I think that's not im very important because yeah , it doesn't matter where the microphone is . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah . 
UNKNOWN but you should uh decide where you want to put it . 
UNKNOWN Ah okay , sure , okay , well tha Underneath ? 
UNKNOWN Right ? 
UNKNOWN Um I think where it isn't seen the most . 
UNKNOWN Indeed . 
UNKNOWN It shouldn't be uh very uh visible . 
UNKNOWN Inside . 
UNKNOWN You could p you could put it in a logo of the company . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah sure , why no Yeah but it doesn't makes it uh any more fancy because you get to see uh Uh . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well maybe just in the the spot you just pointed out because I think it should be in a in an important position where people can see it , because it is the the unique uh idea of our remote , huh , the the speech control . 
UNKNOWN I i between the round of the R_ . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , okay . 
UNKNOWN So where do you want to put it ? 
UNKNOWN Well maybe where the one hand But are we talking about the button , or about the microphone ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah actually it does because it you can you can find it better if you use it . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah bu but I think the left s under corner should be the best . 
UNKNOWN It's a way for you to uh So it makes more sense just 'cause other remotes don't have that . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , okay . 
UNKNOWN About a microphone , there is no button . 
UNKNOWN Yeah because a microphone is very small thing , but you can make it look like it's big so as its its really an important function of the remote . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Where isn't i it isn't most in sight . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN I think . 
UNKNOWN Well put it there . 
UNKNOWN I don't mind . 
UNKNOWN That doesn't doesn't really matter . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN Actually doesn't . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
UNKNOWN So ? 
UNKNOWN Any more uh Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So well uh type , supplements , anything . 
UNKNOWN Interface type . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , well we already s discussed that , huh , the the L_C_D_ and Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN The L_C_D_ yeah , uh supplements well the supplement is to yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think I thought the , like you said , like scroll next to the remote isn't that handy . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think it's better to just up what you'd like to do on the screen . 
UNKNOWN If you want to go back you have to back button go back , if you want to choose audio settings you press audio settings and it goes to that s sub-menu . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Hey , . 
UNKNOWN Um yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah the the young people do like uh scroll uh yeah . 
UNKNOWN Use the scroll . 
UNKNOWN Yeah ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah I think so too . 
UNKNOWN You do like it ? 
UNKNOWN So why not , on on side . 
UNKNOWN Or at least Yeah I don't know if it's really the scroll , but the menu they like most , and I think you can never get through a menu great with a scroll uh But you have it's f uh we have five or four or something . 
UNKNOWN Fast , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah I think it is is faster . 
UNKNOWN So if you've got a settings , if you Yes . 
UNKNOWN Becau I think the scroll's easier if you have a lot of options , but if you don't have a lot of option then Y Uh-huh . 
UNKNOWN You have a lot of options , because when you use Yeah you get w when you use uh the settings menu for example to look up some uh uh some channels on your uh on your television , you should scroll scroll down uh on a menu which probably does not fit on your screen . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , okay , true . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So then it's uh very handy to to scroll down , you make just a rubber just like uh on your mouse or . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Just put it on the side and it's very easy to use . 
UNKNOWN Okay , no problem . 
UNKNOWN And I think I would it would make even more fancy because you have another interesting thing on the side which you can touch and Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It's also different . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Well there's our five minutes uh warning . 
UNKNOWN Um any more uh questions about about the design or the user interface or different components , everyone ? 
CONFUSION Um . 
UNKNOWN No , colours are clear , shape is clear , material is clear . 
UNKNOWN Everybody think they can can work for that ? 
UNKNOWN Okay , what's the standard colour ? 
UNKNOWN And a standard , yeah we don't no we have different colour . 
UNKNOWN Is there a standard colour ? 
UNKNOWN I I You got you got different colours , but you should have a standard colour . 
UNKNOWN How many colours are we going to Black . 
UNKNOWN You should you should have a black one because uh I think black is standard . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , black I think is is the standard . 
UNKNOWN Black ? 
UNKNOWN With the with the yellow uh Just a regular uh remote colour . 
UNKNOWN But if you want to be different , then uh Silver . 
UNKNOWN Dark grey , something like this this colour or something . 
UNKNOWN Yeah like like yeah . 
UNKNOWN And then have uh different covers uh to use . 
UNKNOWN Or or silver . 
UNKNOWN I think it's better to have silver nowadays . 
UNKNOWN Silver , yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think you see more silver than black . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN You see a lot of t uh silver televisions . 
UNKNOWN But still silver and black are well silver is new but also traditional , so uh Yeah w what about a yellow thing , I mean it could be ugly , but it's definitely fancy . 
UNKNOWN Silver rubber . 
UNKNOWN Yeah the the silver black are our main colours . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think we have silver , black and between those is like I dunno s five colours between them or something . 
UNKNOWN Yeah y I think it's better to Yeah th yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah yeah yeah it'll be a banana yellow , we have . 
UNKNOWN R red . 
UNKNOWN But yeah . 
UNKNOWN That's right . 
UNKNOWN Green , wood , brown . 
UNKNOWN But if you use uh silver , uh rubber s silver rubber isn't fancy . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN True . 
UNKNOWN When you use titanium , silver is fancy , but when you use silver rubber , it isn't fancy . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Silver has to shine , and rubber doesn't shine . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Especially when it's made of soft rubber like this . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN You understand ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I understand . 
UNKNOWN Yeah I would think about colours like uh red , yellow , green , blue , just Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah o of course . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN The fruity colours and the autumn colours , like red and brown , dark red and brown . 
UNKNOWN Fruity . 
UNKNOWN Just all kind of colour . 
UNKNOWN Fruity loops . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Maroon . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so Who's pinging ? 
UNKNOWN And and do we have to have a normal black one , or uh Is it Yeah . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN You are pingin Okay . 
UNKNOWN You ping . 
UNKNOWN I thought we Okay , so uh that wraps it up ? 
UNKNOWN Everybody knows uh what to do ? 
UNKNOWN Well I wrote it down here . 
UNKNOWN Well not what to do . 
UNKNOWN Well I don't know what to do , but . 
UNKNOWN I wrote it down here what to do um . 
UNKNOWN Not what to do . 
UNKNOWN Look . 
UNKNOWN The next meeting is once again in thirty minutes . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um here are the individual actions , and especially notice that uh the Industrial Designer and the User Interface Designer are going to work together on a prototype drawingon a smart board , and of course to all four of us uh specific instructions will be emailed by our personal coach . 
UNKNOWN Ooh . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN S tough . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN We'll be available . 
UNKNOWN But do we have to We'll work together , but do we have to stay here , or do we Right . 
UNKNOWN Well I I'd say just wait uh for emailand uh find out . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN I don't know . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Thin I think we should work . 
UNKNOWN Okay well that was what I had to say , uh , final thoughts from anyone , or ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah I think . 
NEGATION No . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN We're finished . 
UNKNOWN Okay , well thank you very much . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Finished . 
THANKS Thank you very much . 
UNKNOWN So we have to keep talking English now ? 
UNKNOWN Good . 
UNKNOWN Beep . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN What ? 
UNKNOWN So well uh welcome everyone . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um as you may have noticed I uh created separate foldersbecause it was uh tending to get a little busy in our uh shared project documentsuh folder . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I don't know if everybody uh put their own uh documentsin the right folder , which is for now the detailed design meeting . 
UNKNOWN That's new one ? 
UNKNOWN We didn't make any uh Oh in Didn't we just do that ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh , we should save that one . 
UNKNOWN Then I'll move this one . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , save in the folder . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN Save as project . 
UNKNOWN Oh no , this is just one big document, so you can leave that wherever it is . 
CONFIRMATION Oh , okay . 
UNKNOWN Hmm hmm . 
UNKNOWN And we have a evaluation left here . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Agenda. 
UNKNOWN Well not main documentsthis time . 
UNKNOWN Hmm ? 
UNKNOWN Oh uh yes . 
UNKNOWN I have it open myself I guess . 
UNKNOWN Um well the detailed design meeting Huh ? 
UNKNOWN We're finally getting somewhere hopefully . 
UNKNOWN Um what are we going to do ? 
UNKNOWN I've opened it already . 
UNKNOWN Um I'm still going to take some minutes, and if I'm right , you two are going to give a prototype presentation? 
UNKNOWN Oh , sorry . 
UNKNOWN We could . 
UNKNOWN Aren't you ? 
UNKNOWN Yes , you are . 
UNKNOWN And uh m did you do something with evaluation criteria ? 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN Good . 
UNKNOWN And we have a correct agenda. 
UNKNOWN And uh then we have to look at something which is less nice , the finance uh aspect , whether we can afford what we have designed , and if we can we can uh commence the final part which is the production or project evaluation , how did we work together and what are the results , and how happy are we with those . 
UNKNOWN Oops . 
UNKNOWN Okay , well finance uh will be later . 
UNKNOWN Now I'd like to give the word to you two . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Get up stand up . 
UNKNOWN Well uh we made a prototype . 
UNKNOWN just 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN We first start with the overall uh This is about the total remote control . 
UNKNOWN View . 
UNKNOWN We made it green . 
UNKNOWN Just example colour , so uh there's one of the colours we would like to uh see in our prototype . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It's a fresh colour . 
UNKNOWN And uh the screen light blue . 
UNKNOWN Oh uh this the scroll button and the microphone on the on the sides here under . 
UNKNOWN And the R_ and R_ logo , it just says R_ and R_ now , but uh Any questions so far ? 
UNKNOWN Okay ? 
UNKNOWN Big microphone . 
UNKNOWN yeah , just uh just an idea about how to m th that could also be possible . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Oh okay . 
UNKNOWN That's the place where it's going to be , not the size . 
UNKNOWN Uh well , it's an idea in a so . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Oh y you perhaps you should make it a bit big , so people know it's there and uh Uh Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Do not forget it . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN To function it it doesn't really have to be sm uh big of course . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , okay . 
UNKNOWN The microphone could be just a minor uh hole uh on the left uh button . 
UNKNOWN Of course . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Mm , th yeah . 
UNKNOWN Small . 
UNKNOWN Okay um we also made some uh ideas about how uh the options menu would work . 
UNKNOWN Uh using the scroll button on sides uh y uh I uh um Yeah , you push the scroll button and a drop down menu or a pull out menu comes out and uh you get uh you get the options uh becoming available . 
UNKNOWN You push the scroll button and it's claps out if there's a Remote settings , et cetera . 
UNKNOWN For example uh T_V_ settings , uh remote settings , et cetera . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So uh you can scroll down too with the scroll uh button , uh as you can see oh , it's here , just push it in , uh the menu comes out like this and uh i it all becomes visible . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um Yeah , that's c Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And you could also touch it so that it comes out , and and use the the the scroll thing as a with your fingers . 
UNKNOWN Indeed . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN Okay , um it's also uh nice to see that um we made a small uh menu , uh the options menu uh becoming available when pressing the uh scroll uh button , and the opportunity to use the teletext , whi which is used uh which should still be used and we think that it's uh very handy to put it uh not uh under the options menu , but in uh Yes . 
UNKNOWN In an apart uh In a separate button , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So a separate button for for text , okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Perhaps we should use the teletext sign in p yeah . 
UNKNOWN A sign , yeah , just like Okay , indeed . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay , we can uh modify that later . 
UNKNOWN Forgot . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Would you like to make any comments about next uh Previous page, yeah , indeed . 
UNKNOWN Uh well , this is the total interface uh that f of the L_C_D_ screen . 
UNKNOWN Uh the numbers , which is pretty straight forward . 
UNKNOWN We put ano an an extra button in . 
UNKNOWN We can erase it , but It's the button where you can switch channels . 
UNKNOWN just when you are one and you go to two , you can or if you go to five , you can go back to one with that button . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that one , yeah . 
UNKNOWN It has a name . 
UNKNOWN And uh uh we put that in , I thought it would be handy there . 
UNKNOWN Oh my God . 
UNKNOWN Uh this the one number or two numbers button . 
UNKNOWN Below that , the pageand the sound . 
UNKNOWN And uh in the middle the the mute . 
UNKNOWN Uh battery indicator . 
UNKNOWN It's it's a bit big . 
UNKNOWN It's quite large . 
UNKNOWN And this is the uh the on off uh knop , the stand by uh knop . 
UNKNOWN Or at least it should look like it . 
UNKNOWN And the options uh of teletext . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN You can see very clearly now that the uh teletext and options menu isn't uh taking uh much uh uh it's taking much part of the screen , so it's very uh when you uh when you use it , doesn't uh become irritating to see . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause if you put it on the top you always get see the the options menu . 
UNKNOWN Huh . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause people regularly uh read from left top to right down , so Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well this about it , I think . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Huh . 
THANKS Thank you . 
UNKNOWN I will put it back on the on the nice green . 
UNKNOWN Looks good . 
UNKNOWN And I just missed when I was typing The R_R_ stands for ? 
UNKNOWN That's the logo of the Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Logo , okay . 
UNKNOWN It's th th right now it's only R_ R_ , but uh Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay well I would have recognised it if it were the right colours of course . 
UNKNOWN Full screen . 
UNKNOWN Shit . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
UNKNOWN Sorry . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN Okay , the evaluation criteria , huh ? 
UNKNOWN Oh full screen , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Huh . 
UNKNOWN Evaluation . 
UNKNOWN 'Kay , my task was this time to put up a questionnaire by which we can evaluate the design of the remote control by the questions we requirements from the of the users . 
UNKNOWN My name , my job , okay . 
UNKNOWN My name , my job . 
UNKNOWN The methods . 
UNKNOWN Questionnaire with seven point scale from one to seven , from true to false , like question , is remote big enough , we can say it's true or it's false by steps . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN One means absolutely not true , seven means true . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN The three important things of refa are uh from th of this year is are , is the remote control fancy enough , is it in innovative enough , and is it easy enough to use . 
UNKNOWN Sorry , you used the PowerPointWhat ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And then evaluation itself . 
CONFUSION Uh . 
UNKNOWN So . 
UNKNOWN Bling . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN First question . 
UNKNOWN Is the design fancy enough ? 
UNKNOWN Well Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Project Manager , what do you think ? 
UNKNOWN Well it's looks fancy , especially with the green colour . 
UNKNOWN But does it Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And the the curves which we decided , huh ? 
UNKNOWN Only what happened to the single curve we spoke about last meeting ? 
UNKNOWN Now uh the single curved idea was uh Yeah , okay , you ge um Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It uh oh it's in the background . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN Y you should make uh a sideways uh view . 
UNKNOWN The sideways view , uh that that that ma Ho not that pen . 
UNKNOWN It will be , I guess . 
UNKNOWN Oh , we can Oh g I would smart board . 
UNKNOWN Not that pen . 
UNKNOWN Well it might work one time , huh . 
UNKNOWN Uh can I drawhere or uh Ooh . 
UNKNOWN Suppose so . 
UNKNOWN Think . 
UNKNOWN Ah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah , you can . 
UNKNOWN Oh my God , it works . 
UNKNOWN So it would be uh something like this from the side , but with a bit of uh curve here , right ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's the single curve indeed . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So if you v flip it like this . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Here's yeah . 
UNKNOWN That's not very i it's also uh very handy if you make a side curve way to make the the remote control very thin at the bottom uh at a bottom at a bottom . 
UNKNOWN Uh make it uh rather thick on the top , because uh on the top it has uh the screen , which takes uh in some uh space , and the batteries can be located over there , so uh Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So you just make the back of this part a bit bigger , so that it lays a bit o Yeah , that's a bit of problem maybe . 
UNKNOWN Isn't going to be a little bit heavy at the top ? 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN With two batteries , the whole printplate and t and top , and if you're holding it quite a lot I think Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think yeah , the battery should be in here , because it's just nothing , so if you could Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay , indeed . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause otherwise I think i I think it does . 
UNKNOWN Okay , but we have to rate uh these things now ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , we have to rate . 
UNKNOWN Is it fancy enough ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN True is one , false is seven . 
UNKNOWN So fancy enough means , does it comes to the younger people and the elder people . 
UNKNOWN I think so . 
UNKNOWN I think Yeah , I have to agree , all the colour colours don don doesn't matter that m that much now , it's only design . 
UNKNOWN I if you don't make it green , then the elder people won't won't like it . 
UNKNOWN It's pretty fancy . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN you get th Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN I think it does . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And the design . 
UNKNOWN Well I think uh especially because of the microphone and the L_C_D_ screen also . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I don't know whether older people will use it , but I would make it a two or something . 
UNKNOWN Very new thing . 
UNKNOWN Well Fancy the old people will . 
UNKNOWN So A two ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Huh ? 
UNKNOWN It's true , it's a one . 
UNKNOWN Alright , it's a one . 
UNKNOWN Very fancy . 
UNKNOWN Oh it's a one . 
UNKNOWN No , it's a two . 
UNKNOWN Little bit strange we have to judge that ourselves , huh ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I n used I wouldn I should use that one , but it doesn't Okay , no it's two ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But it's a one uh Maybe uh Yeah . 
UNKNOWN True is a one . 
UNKNOWN Very true , is it very true or isn't that true ? 
UNKNOWN Well I'd say two on a scale No , okay well , that's true . 
UNKNOWN Well they think it's very true , but uh Yeah , but We should perhaps That not . 
UNKNOWN It's very true , because we designed it to be very fancy , so It's very fancy , I think . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I think two . 
UNKNOWN Have you ever seen a remote control like this ? 
UNKNOWN No , okay , so so it's fancy . 
UNKNOWN That's fancy enough . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Then ? 
UNKNOWN Okay , one two . 
UNKNOWN That doesn't matter that much , so make it a one . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Let's give it a two . 
UNKNOWN Is it innovative ? 
UNKNOWN I think it is , because it has an L_C_D_ screen , a mi microphone . 
UNKNOWN Enough . 
UNKNOWN Yeah m Yeah , and you use these buttons the most , huh ? 
UNKNOWN And uh uh the scroll is rubber , so s Eno enough to I think . 
UNKNOWN We have for the search function . 
UNKNOWN It's from rubber . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN The scroller a bit I think it's it's a one yeah . 
UNKNOWN It's a one I think . 
UNKNOWN True . 
UNKNOWN Also huh uh-huh the buttons , are they easy to find ? 
UNKNOWN That was a big requirement of the old people . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , because they're right on your screen . 
UNKNOWN So you can use the b the the arrows . 
UNKNOWN Huh . 
UNKNOWN They're right on your screen , so I don't know where you'd search . 
UNKNOWN With the ones Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Are all the buttons easy to find ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Not only this buttons , all the buttons . 
UNKNOWN Well , I think they are . 
UNKNOWN The options are it uh little bit harder , but if you touch the options then it's uh No they're not , but they're they're they are easy to find . 
UNKNOWN Take a harder look , yeah , sure . 
UNKNOWN I think th it's easy t Yeah , I think this is easy now . 
UNKNOWN It's easier than the regular uh remote control . 
UNKNOWN I think th I think the options buttons are not the the easiest way to to to handle . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So So which So which number are we going to fill in ? 
UNKNOWN True . 
UNKNOWN I would rate it a Yeah , okay , that's true , that's true . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , they are a lot easier to find than uh th than on the regular remote controls where you have to uh find out what which sign or icon means on uh every button . 
SURPRISE Oh .
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So you have t you have to use the the the manual to understand most Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But that's that's vantage of L_C_D_ screen , you can have text . 
UNKNOWN I would say yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think it's uh it's a two , at least . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , you can make it a two . 
UNKNOWN A two , yeah ? 
UNKNOWN Two , three and what do you think ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It's not perfect , but A three ? 
UNKNOWN I think it's a three . 
UNKNOWN Okay , so we have two , two , three . 
UNKNOWN And why is that ? 
UNKNOWN I personally think , because I d I don't think i maybe it's easy to use , it has to be easy to find right away . 
UNKNOWN I I think if you have the button at the right , I don't think you can find the option button that easy . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but you don't have t have to use the button on the right . 
UNKNOWN You can touch it . 
UNKNOWN You can touch it . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It said bo both the options . 
UNKNOWN You you can touch options . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , okay , but you have y then you have here s written option on here , the teletext button , right ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay , then okay , good . 
UNKNOWN Then I think also two , yeah . 
UNKNOWN You can touch options and it's comes out . 
UNKNOWN A two , okay , because we have to It's the box below it , huh ? 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN A two , a two . 
UNKNOWN The uh the um Below . 
UNKNOWN Uh the next question the next question . 
UNKNOWN Oh my God . 
UNKNOWN Otherwise we have two results in one question . 
UNKNOWN It's different . 
UNKNOWN Okay , next question . 
UNKNOWN It's easy to use , as well for younger as elderl elderly people . 
UNKNOWN For young people I think it's easy to use . 
UNKNOWN Young means sixteen to forty years . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I was uh Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And elderly from forty eight to their death . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think it's In the entire mankind . 
UNKNOWN I think it's the most useful uh remote control ever to be manufactured . 
UNKNOWN Okay , you're very enthusiastic about your own design , huh ? 
UNKNOWN Also if you're sixty years old Also Yeah , as well as your if you're fif sixty years old , you're holding one of those things in your hand No , but we're going to th make this f for a all kind of people , so it it it has to be If you read the manual , always . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but because it has the regular uh controls , li uh as you can see in the screen now , and uh you don't have all the other options uh always uh on your screen . 
UNKNOWN So it's t I think it's really easy to use . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN You want these options to Uh sure . 
UNKNOWN As well for the for the older people ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but uh Yeah , but they they don't want the uh extra options , right ? 
UNKNOWN So Yeah , okay , but so they could Uh I think it is . 
UNKNOWN And would it be easy for them to use the speech recognition ? 
UNKNOWN If they read a manual . 
UNKNOWN Because that might Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay , well M maybe that's the most user friendly and easy to use . 
UNKNOWN Perhaps that is one of the most uh Uh because a lot of Channel one , channel four , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , alright . 
UNKNOWN Because it it's not it's not it's it's not uh difficult . 
UNKNOWN You say you say uh record to to the to the speech recognition , then you say the question and the answer . 
UNKNOWN And that's everything it does , the speech recognition . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , well maybe that would make it even more easy to use for them . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think it would make it uh I would make it two . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I think it does . 
UNKNOWN So Also two ? 
UNKNOWN Because all the people who can't uh Uh a two . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Not a seven for this ? 
UNKNOWN Sure , two . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN I'd say three . 
UNKNOWN Three ? 
UNKNOWN I would also say three . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN Okay , so we have three three two two or So what are we going to do ? 
UNKNOWN You ? 
UNKNOWN Two . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN Well Two and a half . 
UNKNOWN Okay , a three , I see . 
UNKNOWN Uh Another question . 
UNKNOWN Three ? 
UNKNOWN Give me more . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN Remotes overwhelmed with buttons . 
NEGATION No . 
NEGATION No . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN No , that that's that's yeah . 
UNKNOWN But um I mean , that's definitely one . 
UNKNOWN Tha that's a one , I think , that's definitely a one . 
UNKNOWN That's definitely our uh A false , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Oh nee , oh seven is it ? 
UNKNOWN It is . 
UNKNOWN No ? 
UNKNOWN Oh yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , uh the remote score . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but I think you should make it one scale with with one being good and seven being bad , because otherwise we can't uh calculate anything from the results , so Okay , a one , because we designed for that , huh ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I think isn't , this has to be something like isn't overwhelmed . 
UNKNOWN It's not overwhelmed . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , indeed . 
UNKNOWN True . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN Remote control has uh colours that different that meet different target groups . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause we make them in different colours , so that they uh Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , is optional . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN That's true . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , and I though w we had about single colours , but you can also make uh a wood colour , not just one single colour but a wood-like thing , can't you ? 
UNKNOWN Huh . 
UNKNOWN That it that it looks like wood , like something , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Also with rubber ? 
UNKNOWN Uh I think you can . 
UNKNOWN Whether it looks like wood , it isn't w it isn't wood but You can make a printon rubber , can't you ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , okay . 
UNKNOWN It it feels like rubber , but Well but then when you scratch it it does come off . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah ? 
UNKNOWN So that's a one then , huh ? 
UNKNOWN That's a one ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , it is it is harder to to like Geez . 
UNKNOWN So that's a bit Oh we have time . 
UNKNOWN Do you have many questions ? 
UNKNOWN Uh I have The material used is spongy , that that's uh that's a one , that's m rubber . 
CONFIRMATION Oh , okay well Yeah , but we have We also We have to get to the money . 
UNKNOWN We're getting paid . 
UNKNOWN We're getting paid . 
UNKNOWN What ? 
UNKNOWN What spongy . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah , it's very spongy . 
CONFUSION Uh . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I th think it's not the most spongy thing . 
UNKNOWN Oh but not it's not very spongy , because it's hard rubber . 
UNKNOWN I think it's a three . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , it's a three , because you want to make it uh rather flexible but not too flexible , because it has a L_C_D_ screen . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh-huh , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Hard but Yeah . 
UNKNOWN You can break it . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Remote control is hard to lose . 
UNKNOWN Hard to lose , yeah it sh and it's easy to find . 
UNKNOWN Y yeah , you could you could call it . 
UNKNOWN Y you can't you can't lose it if you're sixty years old . 
UNKNOWN If first time see the thing you didn didn't adjust uh set the microphone , and then you lose it , then you have lost it . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , y you can lose it , but it isn't hard to lose . 
UNKNOWN It isn't hard , no . 
UNKNOWN I think I think this is a two , personally . 
UNKNOWN Two . 
UNKNOWN That it's hard to lose ? 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , it it is there's the it's a six , you think ? 
UNKNOWN Isn't hard to lose . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , so isn't hard to lose you . 
UNKNOWN Isn't hard to lose , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Isn't hard to lose . 
UNKNOWN So it's a two . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , you can lose it , so I don't you can make it a three I It does have an a built in function . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN You can't lose it . 
UNKNOWN Or if you're you're sixty years old , your demands I think yeah , I think also . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but a har A hard to lose is good . 
UNKNOWN So it should this question should be hard to lose . 
UNKNOWN Nee . 
UNKNOWN Hard to lose . 
UNKNOWN It's difficult to lose it . 
UNKNOWN Oh right . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , this this is hard to lose . 
UNKNOWN It is hard to lose . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , so then this is it is almost true , so a two . 
UNKNOWN This Two , yeah . 
UNKNOWN A two . 
UNKNOWN A two . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN And most all because of the option to Whoa . 
UNKNOWN Huh ? 
UNKNOWN Ooh . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , it's okay . 
UNKNOWN That happens above also . 
SURPRISE Oh .
CONFUSION Uh . 
UNKNOWN But maybe when you scroll away and back it will be normal , but Yep . 
UNKNOWN Yeah ? 
CONFIRMATION Oh , okay . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN Oh , it isn't , well okay . 
UNKNOWN Oh well , it doesn't . 
UNKNOWN Remember . 
UNKNOWN put the cor cursor on the . 
UNKNOWN Okay okay okay . 
UNKNOWN Remote control mainly be sold to younger people . 
UNKNOWN Click . 
UNKNOWN True . 
UNKNOWN I think it will , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah ? 
UNKNOWN True . 
UNKNOWN True ? 
UNKNOWN Very true ? 
UNKNOWN Uh yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh well I a a two . 
UNKNOWN No , I don't think very true because the colours . 
UNKNOWN Uh Materials , yeah . 
UNKNOWN There . 
UNKNOWN We have the colours . 
UNKNOWN Um we have the buttons is aren't that that much . 
UNKNOWN Nah , the material isn't that So I don I think I think it's a three . 
UNKNOWN It's it's much more younger . 
UNKNOWN Uh okay . 
UNKNOWN So ma uh make it make it a two . 
UNKNOWN Well I think it's it's uh a lower number , so better because w we designed it for young people especially , didn't we ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but I uh Okay , okay . 
UNKNOWN I think it's a two but Two two two . 
UNKNOWN What do you think ? 
UNKNOWN I think because yeah ? 
UNKNOWN Questions ? 
UNKNOWN A two ? 
UNKNOWN I think it's two . 
UNKNOWN Two . 
UNKNOWN I think it's two too , two too too . 
UNKNOWN Uh-huh . 
UNKNOWN Let's make everything a two . 
UNKNOWN In the features ? 
UNKNOWN Dissatisfy younger people . 
UNKNOWN Younger people . 
UNKNOWN Um Yeah , but those are more fancy functions , not not really many features or something . 
UNKNOWN It has What did Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well perhaps not . 
UNKNOWN Because younger peoples are cr critical and they wanted a lot of features on this thing . 
UNKNOWN Well that it doesn't . 
UNKNOWN Well , n not exactly but uh uh if it had some games on it or something like that , but it's for a remote control I think it i it would satisfy those needs . 
UNKNOWN Yeah bu but I think they like the speech . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , the speech possibility , the colours . 
UNKNOWN You could call to your uh yeah , and the screen , yeah . 
UNKNOWN L_C_D_ screen and scroll . 
UNKNOWN Scroll options , yeah . 
UNKNOWN I I think they'll be quite met with their expectations . 
UNKNOWN Right , that that that those are features . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN It has relatively few features , with Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It's three features , basically , the L_C_D_ touch screen is feature . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN The microphone is a feature . 
UNKNOWN No , aren't the features the microphone's feature and that you can change the channel's feature , and that you can change the volume is feature , and that you can change the options of the remote , uh uh something like that . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , okay . 
UNKNOWN Ours had other features with Okay , you think one , what do you think ? 
UNKNOWN I think yeah , and then you have the audio settings , channel setting , video settings . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN The easy volume up button . 
UNKNOWN Those are features . 
UNKNOWN Remote younger people usually use the remote control to put on the volume . 
UNKNOWN Yeah yeah . 
UNKNOWN Turn uh turn up the volume . 
UNKNOWN So I've chos I shou I think it's it's it's a one . 
UNKNOWN Enough features ? 
UNKNOWN Personally , yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think once you've 'cause you have the channel features b uh you have the uh screen features , audio features , the you have all buttons on it which you'd like , microphone extra , L_C_D_ screen extra , scroll thing extra . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think two or three . 
UNKNOWN You . 
UNKNOWN three , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Two . 
UNKNOWN I'd say three , so two it is then or Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah uh a two a two . 
UNKNOWN Make it make it a two . 
UNKNOWN One two three . 
UNKNOWN Or make it uh a fucking two . 
UNKNOWN Just another two . 
UNKNOWN We like two . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN You can see the remote control is R_ and R_ . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , there's R_ and R_ in front . 
CONFUSION Uh . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN Uh it's not the colour , so maybe you should make two , but it has R_ and R_ . 
UNKNOWN Has oh yeah , do did have nah y you have the black one . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And we'll probably make also a yellow one . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but not R_ and R_ yellow I think . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , maybe maybe two . 
UNKNOWN Well m th but the logo is on on the front , so a two , yeah , that's Oh , well that's that's pretty good , huh ? 
UNKNOWN Maybe two . 
UNKNOWN Okay , true , yeah . 
UNKNOWN One d on i it's the colours and the I think it is , but I don't know what you think . 
UNKNOWN X_ marks spot . 
UNKNOWN And the menu is avail that is available is easy to use . 
UNKNOWN I think it's easier to use than a regular remote control , because when you push on the options menu , you get the the the various options uh entirely explained . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , tha that's so true . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Entirely explained . 
UNKNOWN Instead of uh just finding out what an icon means on a button . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , uh I think that wou that would be quite hard to learn to use it . 
UNKNOWN And you can navigate easier , because wi with the you have to push the the the arrows and with a normal T_V_ uh remote . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , you can navigate . 
CONFUSION Uh . 
UNKNOWN You're not satisfied , okay . 
UNKNOWN No , I'm not not convinc . 
UNKNOWN Let's start over again then . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Let's make a different remote . 
UNKNOWN Let's go th for I think it would be a t yeah , two . 
UNKNOWN Well Menu . 
UNKNOWN A two ? 
UNKNOWN Now lower . 
UNKNOWN A two . 
UNKNOWN We only have twos . 
UNKNOWN Oh yeah , I think so . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh just twos . 
UNKNOWN So okay , we have one three , a one , that that have to got up . 
UNKNOWN And three . 
UNKNOWN One three and a few ones . 
UNKNOWN Two threes . 
UNKNOWN Two two two two two . 
UNKNOWN We m mostly have twos , so it's pretty good . 
UNKNOWN So two , yeah . 
UNKNOWN The average is a two . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN That is quite good in my opinion . 
UNKNOWN The average . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think so too . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , I think so . 
UNKNOWN That Ooh . 
UNKNOWN We can be happy . 
UNKNOWN Save . 
UNKNOWN Ooh . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN What is it ? 
UNKNOWN It's like a bug or something . 
UNKNOWN It's a fly . 
UNKNOWN A fly , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Oh m Yeah . 
UNKNOWN A f butterfly . 
UNKNOWN Top . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN That's it . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN That was your evaluation uh show , okay , so we don't have to calculate anything because of um these results . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
CONFIRMATION Sure . 
UNKNOWN No , it's two . 
UNKNOWN Okay , good . 
UNKNOWN The average is two . 
UNKNOWN It's good . 
UNKNOWN Um let's see oh , it isn't asked to save but it did already And this Everything okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I uh uh I uh saved it . 
UNKNOWN Exactly . 
UNKNOWN Well , the next part uh might be a little bit difficult to do in a group , but I am willing to try it . 
UNKNOWN Because we are going to look at the finance and I have a nice Excel sheetto do that . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Redesign . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN And um I'm not sure if I put it in the project folder . 
UNKNOWN look on that . 
UNKNOWN Um and we're going to calculate the production costs , and if they are uh under or at twelve Euro fifty , we're good , and if they're not we're going to uh re-design , but we have to do that uh very very quick I think , yes . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So we're going to erase features or something . 
UNKNOWN Um I don't know if I put the Excel sheetin the n not in the folder . 
UNKNOWN Do you have the cost or uh Let's hope . 
UNKNOWN f fifty five Euros . 
UNKNOWN We're going to be here at eight o'clock . 
UNKNOWN I think it's I think it's still in my own documentsfolder . 
UNKNOWN We're goin still going to be here at eight o'clock . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN I doubt it . 
UNKNOWN Oh shit . 
UNKNOWN Perhaps we've got features that don't exist in the Excel sheet. 
UNKNOWN Yeah mm yeah , maybe . 
UNKNOWN So Okay , well this is it . 
UNKNOWN The microphone . 
UNKNOWN No , it was in my uh my information , so uh Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It i It wasn't too much . 
UNKNOWN Yeah ? 
UNKNOWN maybe you're going scrap scrap it . 
UNKNOWN As well as the L_C_D_ screen . 
UNKNOWN Whoa . 
UNKNOWN Well , if it doesn't work I want to fill it in , but uh But you should uh direct The number of We've got a battery , one or t two batteries , or not ? 
UNKNOWN Um maybe I could ask one of you to uh fill it in , so that I can also uh take minutes, and uh maybe the other can uh use that thing to count uh numerous functions . 
UNKNOWN No prob . 
UNKNOWN Ah . 
UNKNOWN Count it ? 
UNKNOWN Li like write it be Ah , okay , cool . 
UNKNOWN Well we have to count some things and we have to think about some things . 
UNKNOWN Count it . 
UNKNOWN But you have to fill in this column , huh ? 
UNKNOWN You got Excel to count . 
UNKNOWN No , uh count uh number of functions , because for every button you have to pay and there are different screen shots , so or different different screens , so Yeah , but it's it's more about the energy source , huh ? 
UNKNOWN Oh okay . 
UNKNOWN Well I dra uh Danny , Danny , I'll do that , because I drawthe uh No , no solar cell , no no no no . 
UNKNOWN Huh ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah ? 
UNKNOWN Oh , yea yeah , you design it . 
UNKNOWN Um Yeah . 
UNKNOWN nee one battery , with two small batteries . 
UNKNOWN Do you use a hand dynamo , a battery , kinetic or solar cells ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I would do a battery we do . 
UNKNOWN Solar cell . 
UNKNOWN Right ? 
UNKNOWN No it took a battery ? 
UNKNOWN A battery . 
UNKNOWN We'll wait . 
UNKNOWN One battery , right ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN No hand dynamo . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Hand On advanced chip . 
UNKNOWN Electronics , simple chip advanced chip , right ? 
UNKNOWN We have No , we have sample speaker . 
UNKNOWN But b al but we also have sample speaker , do Oh , we already on nine . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , so this one and this one . 
UNKNOWN Uh we ha we have um single what ? 
UNKNOWN Are we ? 
UNKNOWN Oh yay . 
UNKNOWN We have double curved . 
UNKNOWN Single nee single curved . 
UNKNOWN The single . 
UNKNOWN Single . 
UNKNOWN Double curved was uh uh see uh ju three dimensional . 
UNKNOWN But it isn't three dimensional , it isn't curved in a l No no no , single curved is like this . 
UNKNOWN This one is This one is curved like this , right . 
UNKNOWN Oh the the it's not going to work uh people . 
UNKNOWN We have rubber . 
UNKNOWN I'll just fill it in . 
UNKNOWN It's curved like this . 
UNKNOWN Um rubber indeed ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , bu what Oh , but we have curves like it and it . 
UNKNOWN Uh that's the only curve you made , not th uh curved like that . 
UNKNOWN That's uh Huh ? 
UNKNOWN There are two curves , right ? 
UNKNOWN Thirteen ? 
CONFIRMATION Oh , okay I understand , I understand . 
UNKNOWN With a scroll wheel , right ? 
UNKNOWN Rubber . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Is he integrated ? 
UNKNOWN No , eh ? 
UNKNOWN I don't know . 
UNKNOWN Push button . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , we gotta integrate scroll wheel and push button , because when you push it and you w it won't just pu uh makes possible to s Not going to work ? 
UNKNOWN No , we don't have push button . 
UNKNOWN Oh yeah , right , we want it to it's not it's not no . 
UNKNOWN L_C_D_ display . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN Fifteen , oh , too bad . 
UNKNOWN Okay um But now button supplements . 
UNKNOWN Oh but with special colour we have . 
UNKNOWN A special form , right ? 
UNKNOWN We don't got the button supplements . 
UNKNOWN Oh , we don't have any buttons , so Yeah , we need to uh No , uh we have fifteen and oh , right . 
UNKNOWN Eighteen and a half , damn . 
UNKNOWN We have to lower it with six points . 
UNKNOWN Damn . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Twelve and half . 
UNKNOWN We could lose the curve . 
UNKNOWN Nah . 
UNKNOWN We could use I think we should scrap the sample speaker . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I would lose the curve . 
UNKNOWN We could lose the scroll wheel . 
UNKNOWN You could make it just a regular scroll wheel . 
UNKNOWN But you can't push it , so you have to tap . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , if you can't push it you have to tap the the options window uh button here and then uh scroll down with the d with uh with uh the button . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , alright . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I think that will be our best bet . 
UNKNOWN So normal scroll wheel ? 
UNKNOWN Normal scroll wheel . 
UNKNOWN And I think we should lose the curve . 
UNKNOWN Lose Okay , so we don't exactly need the single We don't need a curve . 
UNKNOWN It's four pri it four units . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but if you would i it is a new feature , it it's something special . 
UNKNOWN But w d wha Curved then it will be square . 
UNKNOWN No , the curve doesn't really No , then it will won't uh stand up from the table . 
UNKNOWN 'S possible to lose curve . 
UNKNOWN Then it would just Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Was that does that mean to it , single curve ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's meant with scr uh with s curve . 
UNKNOWN The curve is uh in a dimension . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN If you make it a flat one , s n it's no curve , you got no curves . 
UNKNOWN So We would lose this one ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but tha that that only is one . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , we could s yeah , a bit . 
UNKNOWN No , two . 
UNKNOWN No , one . 
UNKNOWN Sixteen point three . 
CONFIRMATION Oh , okay , indeed . 
UNKNOWN So we don't Yeah , we also have to No , otherwise we don't have an L_C_D_ screen . 
UNKNOWN So we still Could could we do it on a regular chip on printor something ? 
UNKNOWN Is it possible to make No . 
UNKNOWN No ? 
UNKNOWN Ma y you just can't do that , or uh We changed th Yeah , and the single curved to uncurved . 
UNKNOWN And what did you change ? 
UNKNOWN You changed the uh scroll wheel and Oh , but it's just one point , so maybe you should should uh Yeah , you should you should drop the speech recognition . 
UNKNOWN Single curved . 
UNKNOWN Flat . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , so that does doesn't doesn't that mu I think Scrap sample speaker ? 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN That that's uh Yes , four points . 
UNKNOWN The sample speaker is two d wait , f s four points . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but it's t Yeah , but it is uh it it is a new feature , it is something special . 
UNKNOWN And then you can keep the curve . 
UNKNOWN Or can't you ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , uh becau uh when you lose the Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but what what else what else uh do you want to scrap ? 
UNKNOWN F You have to we have to scrap four points . 
UNKNOWN I don't know . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's difficult . 
UNKNOWN Or make it on a hand dynamo , but I don't think that will work . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Ma make it with wood instead of rubber ? 
UNKNOWN No , that's no . 
UNKNOWN Make it w uh when you made it uh uh uh a remote control of wood ? 
CONFUSION Uh . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , it it i Yeah , it also uh it also takes one point less . 
UNKNOWN You don't make a remote control of Ah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN We could make it titanium instead of rubber . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but uh a wooden remote control only helps for uh old people we discussed , yes ? 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN Oh can I ask something ? 
UNKNOWN What is special colour ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Is that the wood uh wood uh this , we have to have that one too ? 
UNKNOWN I think it is . 
UNKNOWN It isn't . 
UNKNOWN What ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but it's only a half . 
UNKNOWN But I think the only option is to drop the uh sample speaker . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Sample speaker . 
UNKNOWN To knock the sample speaker , yeah . 
UNKNOWN And sample sensor . 
UNKNOWN Th then we still have too much if we use the uh Yeah , we we scrap that one ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , okay , three . 
UNKNOWN But m yeah , course , but What we'll have . 
UNKNOWN Point three . 
UNKNOWN Huh ? 
UNKNOWN Let's make it thirteen or fourteen . 
UNKNOWN Point twelve . 
UNKNOWN See , a po three . 
UNKNOWN We need point three . 
UNKNOWN That's a scroll wheel . 
UNKNOWN Uh it's a colour . 
UNKNOWN Don't make it wood . 
UNKNOWN A colour . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but a wood we can make it brown , dark brown , not wood . 
UNKNOWN Make it uh Yeah , but it's it's special colour , is it a all kind of colours ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , special colours , fruity colours . 
UNKNOWN It's also green or uh Yeah , but it's a special colour than just rubber colour . 
UNKNOWN Is it also no that that's just normal colour fruit colours . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Normal colours , yellow Yeah , but then I d I don't think we can ever make to a twelve and half . 
UNKNOWN You have to add something to the rubber to make it green . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN You don't say here's green rubber . 
UNKNOWN They don't sell green rubber plants . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , you can , you should you have to lose No , it is the scroll wheel , I guess . 
UNKNOWN But then we have to scrap L_C_D_ display , we have to scrap uh s advanced chip . 
UNKNOWN No no no . 
UNKNOWN No then we have to scrap everything we got because how many colours we gonna make ? 
UNKNOWN Five ? 
UNKNOWN If we lose the scroll wheel and make it totally uh depending uh dependent on uh the touch screen then it's possible to make . 
UNKNOWN Then we have two . 
UNKNOWN S touch . 
UNKNOWN A push , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Then we can make add two colours on it . 
UNKNOWN And then you can and then you can add to the colours . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , two colours it . 
UNKNOWN Special c Okay , if you lose uh if you lose the You lose this one , you got eleven point five and you make i and then you can make uh the spec single curve , for example . 
UNKNOWN Switch colours . 
UNKNOWN It was such a great idea . 
UNKNOWN They can add two colours . 
UNKNOWN But the colours . 
UNKNOWN Um how ma uh the colours like l she told , is that all the colours we add or Yeah , but we we we are we have yellow , red , uh black , titanium . 
UNKNOWN How d uh uh how many colours ? 
UNKNOWN What do you mean ? 
UNKNOWN Special colours , all the colours you want , because you want to make p Yeah , but uh when you use more than one colour , it's a special colour . 
UNKNOWN Ah okay . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN But I think when you use the colour that's not originally the rubber then you use special colour , 'cause you have to add it . 
UNKNOWN I suppose . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but the rubbers alls original black . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , so you always lose the special colour . 
UNKNOWN You co you could make it always black , like normal remote . 
UNKNOWN Yeah b Yeah , but we're gonna make it yellow uh red , and then you add you have two special colours on top of the one we have now . 
UNKNOWN Nee we we also want to make ano another colour . 
UNKNOWN Oh right , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , we should u Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but m Yeah , because we have more colours than only black . 
UNKNOWN We have to make this like four or five or something . 
UNKNOWN That's what it means . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but isn't it per remote that you pay ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I then I think I p I don I don't think they me mean they're special Yeah , okay okay , true . 
UNKNOWN Oh right , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Half ? 
UNKNOWN Is it per remote ? 
UNKNOWN I think you pay half per remote . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's right , and you one colour per remote . 
UNKNOWN So each remote with a special colour . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , indeed , yeah . 
UNKNOWN So then it is one . 
UNKNOWN You don't need four of those uh four of those special colours in one in one remote . 
UNKNOWN True , true . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN I hope . 
UNKNOWN We have two points spare . 
UNKNOWN So the battery , we have um advanced chip on print.

UNKNOWN Yeah , single curve . 
UNKNOWN Because that was very important , huh ? 
UNKNOWN It's too bad for the speaker .

CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN A and we changed something , I guess , or not ? 
UNKNOWN We Oh no . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Twelve Euro fifty . 
UNKNOWN Um and did you try to make a new design , or what were you trying to do ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I tried to copythat one , but it didn't work . 
UNKNOWN It didn't work . 
UNKNOWN So we could fix it like tha that it's like this . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Strange . 
UNKNOWN You could select it all , but then you can't erase . 
UNKNOWN Strange . 
UNKNOWN Oh , you can arrange Hmm , can't you then just say copy?

CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I don't think I can , but uh we can try . 
UNKNOWN Uh , we already try . 
UNKNOWN Well it should be possible . 
UNKNOWN Oh , yeah , no , ha-ha . 
UNKNOWN Oh no . 
UNKNOWN Well you can drawover it with white uh pen . 
UNKNOWN No ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , we tried it earlier . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN It's very much work . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Sorry . 
UNKNOWN Well but that's also useful for the evaluation , because I think uh we have a prototype now which we can afford and uh we only need to drawa little bit to get a good uh design . 
UNKNOWN Evaluation drops . 
UNKNOWN Doodle . 
UNKNOWN And I think we should then move on to the production evaluation because of the time . 
UNKNOWN And erase the mic . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , goodbye mic . 
UNKNOWN All I need is no mic . 
UNKNOWN Let's see , we can save this now . 
UNKNOWN Oh , I already erased half of the line . 
UNKNOWN Bon chance No , add Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And move back to here . 
UNKNOWN Too bad , oh . 
UNKNOWN Like this ? 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Still looks nice . 
UNKNOWN And then all green . 
UNKNOWN Okay , well thank you . 
UNKNOWN Oh , that's erase . 
UNKNOWN Looks like a iPod . 
UNKNOWN Oh , no . 
UNKNOWN Hey , but you can erase that . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's a bit weird . 
SURPRISE Uh-oh . 
UNKNOWN Oh , now I'm line . 
UNKNOWN S Difference between lines and text and the pen . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
SURPRISE Oh .
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN All I need is mic . 
UNKNOWN And you can't erase this ? 
UNKNOWN Hmm , strange . 
UNKNOWN No , it's weird . 
UNKNOWN Okay , well uh just leave it at this and quickly save . 
UNKNOWN Station page. 
UNKNOWN Um and then we are going to the project or product evaluation . 
UNKNOWN Huh , looks fucking boring now . 
UNKNOWN We just did our project evaluation . 
UNKNOWN Um well , I think I can sit for that since it's almost my final slide. 
UNKNOWN Um what did you think about uh the process ? 
UNKNOWN How satisfied are we ? 
UNKNOWN Deadlines were sometimes very short . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Bu but stressful . 
UNKNOWN But And stressful . 
UNKNOWN You think , no , my presentationisn't ready . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think we it should be b it would be better if we worked a little bit together . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Now we worked through each other , something he said yeah , and you had information I also had , so some some things I had in my presentation, they already told , so So yeah , that I don't think that is the best way to work at for such project . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And you could ask things . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , you had information I didn't have and then uh Oh right . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And for me it sometimes was a surprise who was going to present what , huh ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And uh Yeah . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN So you would say uh communicate during our individual uh work . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , no , or maybe session of five minutes together or something , and then work separate . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but but why not work here together , for example ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , you could Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Why should we be separated from each other in those difference uh different rooms ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Well , probably to simulate the whole working uh process , huh , th you can't have a meeting uh for several weeks . 
UNKNOWN I think so too . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but then you can work together too when A chat would also be uh Well , I I don't really like the board , it doesn't really work great . 
UNKNOWN Yeah m yeah , like she told . 
UNKNOWN Then you can work together too by mailor by , I dunno , chat , something , but now we're completely separated from each other . 
UNKNOWN Huh , oh right . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN I don't think that was the best way , but Yeah , the technology's okay . 
UNKNOWN But the technology was uh fantastic . 
UNKNOWN Work now ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah okay , but I don I do I think becau that's because Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Sometimes I think . 
UNKNOWN Perhaps it is e Yeah , perhaps it is easier to get one of those uh dig digital pens or so and to uh and lay it next to that keyboard over there . 
UNKNOWN It does work , but sometimes it doesn't erase or it doesn't uh Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So you can drawuh see it over th on the screen . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , like the f like a plotters or something , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yep yep yep yep yep . 
UNKNOWN So you don't think the SMARTboard is is really useful or Yeah , so it's maybe a bit unnatural also . 
UNKNOWN But Well it is useful , but it doesn't really work all the time . 
UNKNOWN It's useful , but not m Because when you put this pen on the screen uh uh for exam and line is d being drawn at at two or three centimetres uh below . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , it is useful , but No . 
UNKNOWN Th the pen doesn't The line is a bit off . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , you can point to where you want the line to be . 
UNKNOWN But Yeah . 
UNKNOWN The project uh because of the deadlines you didn't had the time to uh have , you didn't have time to uh to make a very uh qualitati qualitative uh presentation. 
UNKNOWN So you used uh this uh the different PowerPointpresentationsuh in which you put your uh material in the Oh . 
UNKNOWN That wasn't me . 
UNKNOWN Uh so um the means , we discussed the smart board , and what about uh this digital pen ? 
UNKNOWN Wasn't me . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I I I used it , it it was you can use it , it's quite handy I think . 
UNKNOWN I didn't use it at all . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , well I use it as a a normal pen and and and only you use it to uh get it on the computer , huh ? 
UNKNOWN But I didn't I uh I used it too , but oh well . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I used it to y to Yeah , it did work pretty well . 
UNKNOWN I didn't use . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I don't think why you would want to use it actually , but it it does work . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , because it shou To make some designs, it is very easy . 
UNKNOWN No yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It is it is yeah , it is easy for to design something and then load it in your computer . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , and then you can show it to everybody . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But to write it th yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It's b bi little bit too big to write . 
UNKNOWN It doesn't really write normally . 
UNKNOWN It's a bit Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , it's too big , it's too fat . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Fat document, those . 
UNKNOWN Okay , um and what about the teamwork ? 
UNKNOWN Team work was okay . 
UNKNOWN I think it was great , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , well I think so too . 
UNKNOWN Only thing that we worked through , past each other . 
UNKNOWN we Yeah , but that was it was our assignment , huh ? 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN With some things that was only problem , but Yeah yeah yeah , but furthermore better . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but it was because we didn't uh Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay , and maybe I should walk out of the room when you discuss uh this point , the leadership . 
UNKNOWN That's yeah , no prob . 
UNKNOWN I thought it was good , but uh Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Ah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah well , okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Not too much , not too too too too . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN And creativity ? 
UNKNOWN Well , when we look at this I'd say we have been creative , huh ? 
UNKNOWN But There was room for You did ? 
UNKNOWN Well . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , or the room for it was the idea to be creative , so You got some standard ideas in your head and this what came out . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN And you get get stuff from the from the computer , but Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN The information uh was sometimes uh a little bit too late or Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Little bit uh lo yeah . 
UNKNOWN Too late it it it took a lot of time before you got your ema yeah . 
UNKNOWN You just sit there for ten minutes . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , where is that email? 
UNKNOWN I played I think seven times Solitaire something . 
UNKNOWN Well , I didn't have time for that . 
UNKNOWN Oh did you ?

UNKNOWN I didn't find the didn't look but uh I didn't look , but I got like one emailafter ten minutes or something . 
UNKNOWN At some times I Sometimes I received like like five emails at at one moment , and then I even got spam . 
UNKNOWN Was searching and searching . 
UNKNOWN No , I I never got that . 
UNKNOWN I always N yeah . 
UNKNOWN Or something like that . 
UNKNOWN That's what we said . 
UNKNOWN So does this I think lik oh and information was a bit low I think , sometimes , in in in in the beginning I didn't understand what what to do . 
UNKNOWN And it not a lot uh No , the first one . 
UNKNOWN No , w I didn't know Make a r yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , like I with with the remote and I never new we have t we had to uh yeah made a made a rec a remote control . 
UNKNOWN I didn't know uh nee . 
UNKNOWN And I didn't know what to do for the first ten minutes before we got here , so I went , right . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , so So , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN No stepping on the table and then looking at the internet page. 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And I was working and working and work Okay , well um but after all we can say uh we are satisfied , but it it could've been uh better . 
UNKNOWN Just looking at the screen and uh Yeah , an Yeah , that will be handy . 
NEGATION No . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN When we get uh when we have we would have gotten uh more information . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , more information about the costs . 
UNKNOWN Faster . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN First of all I didn't think uh that we were able to make an L_C_D_ screen uh first point , but uh it was possible uh uh , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , it only costs four units . 
UNKNOWN Uh yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yea uh so tha actually you could make an L_C_D_ screen but no mic , or it could make mic but no L_C_D_ screen , when you look at that . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that was a bit mean to put it in the end . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And uh what were the other points to to improve this whole process ? 
UNKNOWN Uh , I dunno . 
UNKNOWN Um Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Think that's about it . 
UNKNOWN Nothing . 
CONFUSION Hmm .

CONFUSION Uh . 
UNKNOWN Faster laptop . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Uh .

UNKNOWN And furthermore the the the network was okay . 
UNKNOWN Everything you loaded was also av available there . 
CONFUSION Uh . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , everything worked . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN And so more time uh w might have improved the the quality of work , is what you say . 
UNKNOWN So Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but that It's now half past four half past three , so Yeah , okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but it's just the the off hours between that you will work alone .

UNKNOWN You did ? 
UNKNOWN Well Oh , right . 
UNKNOWN Well uh , we managed , but we did it very quickly . 
UNKNOWN I don't know if that's the best way to when it isn't is it when it is too expensive to quickly re-arrange it and say , okay , this is it , but we had to do it , huh , because we have to have a design , and that is within the budget . 
UNKNOWN Well Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And we evaluated . 
UNKNOWN Maybe we should re-evaluate uh the product , but we did that before , and we also evaluated the project . 
UNKNOWN And I think uh everybody's uh very happy .

UNKNOWN Uh the aim is to reach uh uh to sell as much as fifty million Euros . 
UNKNOWN Uh that's quite a big amount of money . 
UNKNOWN And the production cost should be the half of the selling price . 
UNKNOWN So we have to s Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay now it's time for some discussion . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Uh Yeah . 
UNKNOWN What uh what uh do you want to discuss ? 
UNKNOWN We should get started . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN Uh I'm taking notes. 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Great . 
UNKNOWN Um we each have a specific task , as I saw in my mail. 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN I didn't know if you received the same mail. 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I guess so . 
UNKNOWN Okay so the um uh this industrati Industrial Designer should produce a working design . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Am I correct ? 
UNKNOWN True . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Uh the User Interface Designer should specify the technical functions . 
UNKNOWN Right ? 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN Yeah ? 
UNKNOWN And the Marketing uh Expert should come up with user requirements . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh did any of you already do some work on this part or Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Well I started making an overview for myself , um what I had to do , 'cause we have three design steps and in every step I have a s specific task to perform or whatever . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So I had to uh , I dunno , make an overview for myself about what I have to do , and kind of let it work in to get ideas about well how I have to fill it . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN And do you have any ideas about the product uh so far ? 
UNKNOWN Well I started I started with the first phase , I think was the functional . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN And uh let's see I had to focus on the working design , which you said . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN How does the apparatus work ? 
UNKNOWN And well I basically had two points . 
UNKNOWN Uh according to the coffee uh machine example , I have batteries to supply energy , and we ye use button presses to activate or deactivate certain functions on the T_V_ . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN And that's basically all I have so far . 
UNKNOWN Yeah I got another point . 
UNKNOWN It uses infrared light to communicate the signal to the T_V_ apparatus or stereo . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Wireless uh huh . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So that's very common . 
UNKNOWN Uh it's uh some buttons for for the on off function . 
UNKNOWN You d you already told that . 
UNKNOWN And for the changing up to the to all the channels and changing the volume . 
UNKNOWN That are the the basic options for a remote control . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah I kept it global 'cause that it activates or deactivates specific functions , 'cause I wasn't thinking yet about that . 
CONFIRMATION Okay , yeah . 
UNKNOWN I mean , you wanna ch ch flip the channel but you might wanna use teletext also . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I dunno what the word is in English . 
UNKNOWN Uh Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Same I believe . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh and what did the Marketing Expert do ? 
UNKNOWN Uh well from a marketing uh perspective , um well the function des design phase uh consists out of the user requirements . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um what needs and desires are to be fulfilled ? 
UNKNOWN So there are a few means to reach that um by by doing research uh to see what existing products are there out in the market . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN I mean , what functions do they have . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Um especially what are their shortcomings ? 
UNKNOWN Are there any new functions uh which can be added to our product ? 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um therefore we have to to do some internet search . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN For example for um well what kind of applications do current remote controls support , and what are f featur features of uh current and future televisions ? 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN So we can see uh what needs to be supported . 
UNKNOWN Um and we can interview current users and future users . 
UNKNOWN What w what would they like to see uh on a new remote control ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um especially for future users , uh I'm thinking of early adopters , because they they use new technology first , and they play with a lot of tools and stuff so maybe they have some good ideas to uh to add . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN And you can get that information ? 
UNKNOWN I think I can get that information , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN That would be very handy . 
UNKNOWN So yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um but have you any idea so far as what uh the user requirements are ? 
UNKNOWN No n not specifically . 
UNKNOWN More to how to get them and Yeah ? 
UNKNOWN No ? 
UNKNOWN No okay . 
UNKNOWN I got some uh requirements it has uh it has to be user-friendly . 
UNKNOWN Yeah ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Of course . 
UNKNOWN Obviously . 
UNKNOWN Uh really easy to use buttons , not not uh very small buttons , but not the the also the big big buttons , but just normal buttons . 
UNKNOWN It has to be a small unit . 
UNKNOWN It has to be uh yeah , you can take it with you uh everywhere in in your house . 
UNKNOWN So it has n has not to be l yeah , gigantic uh machine . 
UNKNOWN Big , mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh and a and a good uh zapping range . 
UNKNOWN Uh what do you mean by that ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh the distance uh from your television to your uh remote control has to be , uh yeah um yeah , quite a big distance . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It has to be capable for zapping uh Yeah . 
UNKNOWN From the other end of the room or something ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay um Well I don't think I have anything more to add at the moment . 
UNKNOWN Um I think the best is to go to work . 
UNKNOWN Whoa . 
UNKNOWN Is that you or alright . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Any more points to discuss ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think we can go ahead with what we have . 
UNKNOWN I will summarise the things we discussed and put it in the project folder . 
UNKNOWN Uh the use of the Industrial Designer can work on the working design , etcetera etcetera . 
UNKNOWN And it seems you get more information by email. 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
UNKNOWN So that was it for me . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
CONFIRMATION Thanks . 
UNKNOWN Uh Yeah , in the project folder . 
UNKNOWN Are you going to put the the noteson the Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN The pro okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
UNKNOWN I'm writing very fast . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Hope it's readable . 
CONFUSION Uh . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN Okay um anything more you want to add to the discussion ? 
UNKNOWN I guess so . 
UNKNOWN Well no I'm just a bit wondering what we're gonna do the next uh session ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Do we only have to to do uh phase one , the functional design uh ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Because then we have a Yeah . 
UNKNOWN After that we are going to the conceptual uh Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN We're just working the three phases . 
UNKNOWN Y you do some individual work , we have meeting , individual work , meeting . 
UNKNOWN And at the end of the day we have a final meeting . 
UNKNOWN And then I have to prepare uh I have to defend our design , so make it good . 
UNKNOWN Yeah okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN We'll do our best . 
UNKNOWN I depend on you . 
UNKNOWN Better make it Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I am gonna work on the conceptual design already 'cause yeah it's fairly important to know what kind of components we want to put in . 
UNKNOWN Yeah ? 
UNKNOWN If you can mix it it's okay . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Do we I mean , is it gonna be a multimedia control centre ? 
UNKNOWN Do we want to be able to use the video recorder with it ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN That is my question also because like new new functions Requirements . 
UNKNOWN Well I think that is the user requirements part . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN As to what they want . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN True . 
UNKNOWN Uh do they want all those functions on that small Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But but we need good communication about this stuff , 'cause I have to f put the components into the design . 
UNKNOWN Unit . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN I would first m Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So if I don't know what components to put in , it's kind of hard . 
UNKNOWN Yeah well I I was Yeah well like l li like some like some some remotes who are out there , which I know , there's one button which is very easy to switch between devices . 
UNKNOWN Yeah I understand . 
UNKNOWN I I think we have first to start with the basic functions and we can uh expand them . 
UNKNOWN You can always add a few Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So you can switch to your video and then the same buttons control your video . 
UNKNOWN Hmm , the C_D_ player . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And another function I'll think of switch to your media centre , because that's getting very popular . 
UNKNOWN Yeah so Okay . 
UNKNOWN And then use your Windows media centre under your T_V_ with the same remote control . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So with the switch , one single switch S Yeah records and stuff like that . 
UNKNOWN Yeah I I know what you mean , but you'll ne need several other buttons for a video player . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN You need a play and a forw fast forward and a stop function . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN And you you don't need that for a T_V_ . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN And and for a t uh teletext you need additional buttons as well , so I kind of need to know what we uh need . 
UNKNOWN You need additional yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Whatever , I'll just put my ideas in uh in here and then we can discuss it with the next uh meeting . 
UNKNOWN In the project uh Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN We could just start with the assumption that's only for T_V_ and video . 
UNKNOWN And um reserve the possibility to add other features . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So we have a basic starting point and you can always extend that so make sure it's extendible . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah it it has yeah it has to be user-friendly . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So it's hasn't it's yeah . 
UNKNOWN Th the least amount of functions possible so it's easier to get to know how it works etcetera . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I understand . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah ? 
UNKNOWN Okay and uh I'll see you again uh when the computer tells us to . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Can we leave now or Mm . 
UNKNOWN Half an hour . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , you're di dismissed . 
CONFIRMATION Thanks . 
UNKNOWN You're fired . 
UNKNOWN Not yet . 
NEGATION No . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Alright let's move on . 
UNKNOWN Let's see what we got to do . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN See you later . 
UNKNOWN Yeah see you later . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Good luck . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
THANKS Thank you . 
UNKNOWN Well good luck . 
UNKNOWN What the We're the first . 
GREETING Hello . 
UNKNOWN . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN You all saw the newsflash ? 
UNKNOWN It's I don't know . 
UNKNOWN Or you got the same message ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah I I just saw it one minute ago . 
UNKNOWN Yeah sorry . 
UNKNOWN When I uh Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I didn't see it yet I think . 
UNKNOWN Newsflash ? 
UNKNOWN D did I miss something ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah I received an emailso I thought I I can't mailyou so I thought I'd just drop it in the folder , but Is it unlocked ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah pretty much . 
UNKNOWN Hey what's wrong with my computer ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN . 
UNKNOWN Yeah that's my presentation. 
UNKNOWN Woah . 
UNKNOWN I uh kind of opened it . 
UNKNOWN Huh ? 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Mm ? 
UNKNOWN What the Not really . 
UNKNOWN Oh right . 
UNKNOWN Uh Okay . 
UNKNOWN I think you have to uh change your desktop uh size . 
UNKNOWN Ooh . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN Everybody ready ? 
UNKNOWN Well Alright . 
UNKNOWN Sorry . 
UNKNOWN No no no . 
UNKNOWN computer is uh not functioning ? 
UNKNOWN Yes yes yes . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Where do I find this ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN I'm not so g display huh ? 
UNKNOWN Uh display . 
UNKNOWN And then uh settings ? 
UNKNOWN Appearance ? 
UNKNOWN Huh . 
UNKNOWN Mm I'm not sure I . 
UNKNOWN You read the newsflash ? 
NEGATION No . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN No what was it about ? 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Can we get started or is there some pressing issue ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah my computer is not functioning properly . 
UNKNOWN Oh no pressing . 
UNKNOWN Did you plug in the power cable when you come back ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah yeah . 
UNKNOWN No but my screen is reduced in size . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN What ? 
UNKNOWN That's difficult . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Feedback . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN alt delete . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Format . 
UNKNOWN Format save . 
UNKNOWN . 
UNKNOWN So it doesn't drawthe attention away . 
UNKNOWN This is dreadful . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I made uh uh my own map. 
UNKNOWN No not this , but the task . 
UNKNOWN Oh yeah sure . 
UNKNOWN It's a Yeah . 
UNKNOWN You have Playstation also ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN No that's okay . 
UNKNOWN No I just flapped it , closed it , took it here and then this happened . 
UNKNOWN Ah . 
UNKNOWN Uh where was it ? 
UNKNOWN In settings ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
THANKS Thank you . 
UNKNOWN Huh . 
UNKNOWN Do you guys like your tasks ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I spent a lot of time thinking about what I was gonna do and then a couple of minutes before this I get my function you know the information that I need . 
UNKNOWN Yeah wa wa you actually Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So frustrating . 
UNKNOWN But it it's not clear what you have to to to type uh type in your presentation. 
UNKNOWN So Yeah Yeah exactly . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I I had a whole idea and then just was typing it and then oh . 
UNKNOWN I have to do that so switch . 
UNKNOWN This presentationis mainly based on my own ideas 'cause I hadn't time to intergrate tha the information yet so Really annoying . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So there we are again . 
UNKNOWN By your humble P_M_ . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay this is the agenda. 
UNKNOWN Um we have three presentations, I heard . 
UNKNOWN Really . 
UNKNOWN Yeah really . 
UNKNOWN So who wants to start ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah that's fine . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN We have to start it right away ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Functional ? 
UNKNOWN Uh this is you ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah functional requirements . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
UNKNOWN I'm gonna talk about functional requirements . 
UNKNOWN Um Well uh some research has be done uh has been done . 
UNKNOWN Uh observing of one hundred uh subjects in the usability lab using a remote control . 
UNKNOWN Uh and they also filled in a questionnaire . 
UNKNOWN The findings were um , well you can see them for yourself . 
UNKNOWN They disliked the look-and-feel of current remotes controls . 
UNKNOWN Users think they're ugly . 
UNKNOWN Um they do not match the the operating behaviour of the users . 
UNKNOWN So they they d they don't match what they want to have on it . 
UNKNOWN Um they are often lost somewhere in the room . 
UNKNOWN Um it takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote control . 
UNKNOWN And they're bad for R_S_I_ . 
UNKNOWN I don't know uh how a user can reach that but okay . 
UNKNOWN Um there is also uh was also some research on uh the most relevant and and and irrelevant uh f functions . 
UNKNOWN Ts So they do need to be in the Alright . 
UNKNOWN Uh most irrelevant and less used were audio settings , mono , stereo , uh pitch , bass . 
UNKNOWN Um screen settings for brightness and colour and stuff like that . 
UNKNOWN Um but they are used . 
UNKNOWN I mean the Yeah they do need to be on the on the remote control . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I mean if you can't control the the sound settings I mean if you dislike a very uh loud bass or something , you you need to change that . 
UNKNOWN So um yeah we have to . 
UNKNOWN often . 
UNKNOWN By the way my T_V_ doesn't have an equ equaliser but okay . 
UNKNOWN We c we c Yeah I mean w we can't my my T_V_ has , but we we can leave them uh away . 
UNKNOWN Next generation does . 
NEGATION No . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
UNKNOWN Uh most relevant , uh most used functions , uh they speak for themselves I guess . 
UNKNOWN Uh power button , uh channel , volume selection . 
UNKNOWN Uh teletext but we can skip that because I saw the newsflash , and teletext is so outdated that it it's i should not be used uh any more in the future . 
UNKNOWN N not used anymore . 
UNKNOWN So forget this one . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Uh channel settings , so for programming uh your channels in in the right order . 
UNKNOWN By the way where did you guys get that newsflash from ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I didn't get anything . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , on on the project uh No so it's a text filen in the project folder . 
UNKNOWN I was wondering uh But you you've got more information than uh . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Not by mail. 
UNKNOWN I receiv the mailbut you don't . 
UNKNOWN So That's in the presentation, so Uh below I believe . 
UNKNOWN So teletext can be skipped . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
UNKNOWN Um there was some research on new features in a remote control . 
UNKNOWN Uh about an L_C_D_ screen uh and speech recognition . 
UNKNOWN Well we got an update for the for the audience . 
UNKNOWN Or the the the targeted group . 
UNKNOWN So it's above forty I guess . 
UNKNOWN The new product ? 
UNKNOWN Or below because that's pretty relevant . 
UNKNOWN Yeah below forty . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN I thought I read a Yeah ? 
UNKNOWN Our current customers are in the age group forty plus . 
UNKNOWN And the new product should reach new markets , which is the customers below forty . 
UNKNOWN Below ? 
UNKNOWN Okay well that's that's in the newsfla okay that's a good to know . 
UNKNOWN But where did you get uh that information ? 
UNKNOWN That's in a newsflash . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um because you see see a clear distinction between the age groups , concerning the features . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I mean uh above forty people are not so interested uh not so interested in a screen or speech recognition . 
UNKNOWN Uh but below that age they uh they pretty much are . 
UNKNOWN So I think we can build that in . 
UNKNOWN Um Yeah well we can skip this part as well , because I thought I read above forty so we could skip the features , but we just have to build them in because uh they find it very interesting . 
UNKNOWN Um well we have to keep all the classic functions but make the buttons as user-friendly as possible . 
UNKNOWN Um and and also there's so not only the design of the bus uh buttons but o how you can push them , and stuff like that . 
UNKNOWN So the physical uh aspect of it . 
UNKNOWN Um And I think and certainly for for the for the lower age groups , uh nice design , which uh does not make the remote control in your room . 
UNKNOWN It's it's actually a part of your interior , of of your design in your room . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So it's the people can say , well what's that , well that's my remote control , so it's d it has to look nice and feel nice , and and have all the functions that uh Yeah so the the logo has to be uh present yeah , and the colours as well . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But it also needs to have corporate identity . 
UNKNOWN Present and the colours . 
UNKNOWN So we can't change much of that . 
UNKNOWN Do we have uh yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah so but I I don't think that's that's a problem because the thing has to have a colour anyway , and most of the times there is a brand present on it . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So I think that's not gonna gonna affect it very uh very much . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Well that are the the consequences uh on a marketing uh part . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN It's open already so you can use to find yours . 
UNKNOWN . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN It's F_ five . 
UNKNOWN F_ five . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN Go Jurgen . 
UNKNOWN What is this ? 
UNKNOWN Oh no . 
UNKNOWN How do I uh No no no . 
UNKNOWN You pressed alt F_ four ? 
UNKNOWN I pressed the mouse button . 
UNKNOWN Oh great . 
UNKNOWN It's th that's the self-destruct button . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh maybe you can do it from your computer so talk us through it . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um if you all go stand around uh Computer Um No . 
UNKNOWN Just yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Sure . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
UNKNOWN That's nice . 
UNKNOWN F_ five . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
UNKNOWN I uh had uh two examples . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um this one is the the yeah the advanced one with a lot of options and functions and buttons . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN This the easy one I think we have to to combine them . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN And uh yeah merge the best functions of all examples . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um but yeah the the age is uh under forty ? 
UNKNOWN The mm yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah and and and marketing research stated that that that kind of users are not afraid of of a lot of functions . 
UNKNOWN So we Okay so so we have the option for more functions . 
UNKNOWN So not not too much but yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um yeah . 
UNKNOWN And we do have to integrate the screen and the the speech alright . 
UNKNOWN And the speech recognition yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh yeah this this one we can remove for kids . 
UNKNOWN It's just only for adults so uh we can uh use some advanced options . 
UNKNOWN Yeah from age of sixteen so yeah . 
UNKNOWN But Yeah but I prefer we we uh use the the basic options uh yeah . 
UNKNOWN We have to to make them very easy so for just uh zapping around the channels you can just push one button . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN But if you want to to use your your video recorder or something else , you should use use an uh an advanced option . 
UNKNOWN Yeah but uh the the newsflash also stated that it should control only one device , only your television . 
UNKNOWN Okay one device . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So n it's very easy . 
UNKNOWN So w So there are not extra options in this case , but uh Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I didn't see . 
UNKNOWN Now yeah it's okay . 
UNKNOWN Okay and I also uh yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN W yeah . 
UNKNOWN We have to make it fashionable . 
UNKNOWN Like you uh said uh before . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh yeah the basic functions . 
UNKNOWN Um yeah only use a extra function if they are really needed . 
UNKNOWN Yeah so maybe you can hide them or something . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah well what what we can do with the screen is is all the the configuration options , you can put that in the screen . 
UNKNOWN Yeah you make a screen menu or something . 
UNKNOWN And the and the yeah screen menu to to to uh to do that , and then the basic function just on the device itself . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So it looks very simple and all the advanced features are hidden in the screen , uh with a clear menu . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah and the other oth other uh functionality is the screen . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN What does the screen do ? 
CONFUSION Uh . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
UNKNOWN Did I uh did I break it ? 
UNKNOWN What are wh What . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It's low power . 
UNKNOWN So what does the screen do ? 
UNKNOWN They said they needed it but what does it do ? 
UNKNOWN What do they want with the screen ? 
UNKNOWN For for the advanced functions I think . 
UNKNOWN Yeah that's what we make it up . 
UNKNOWN Yeah well it yeah it didn't it didn't say what they want to do with the screen . 
UNKNOWN So but what did the marketing No . 
UNKNOWN Well I , my guess is it's it's pretty handy for advanced uh advanced functions . 
UNKNOWN Yeah okay it's handy . 
UNKNOWN With no predefined uh We're back online . 
UNKNOWN Like searching for channels and Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah searching for channels , programming them . 
UNKNOWN Ah look . 
UNKNOWN We have your uh oh never mind . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN That's uh I'm al I'm almost finished so Um the we have to to to watch out for the i if we make it f very fashionable , it it the functional functionality will go down . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So we have to make uh a compromise between functionality and fashional fashionable yeah content and form . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Content and form . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Now that that was uh was the end . 
UNKNOWN That was the end . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Well my presentationis a bit uh sucky . 
UNKNOWN Well you can improvise right ? 
UNKNOWN Uh which one is it ? 
UNKNOWN Technical functions ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah a little bit . 
UNKNOWN Uh no . 
UNKNOWN This one ? 
UNKNOWN No no . 
UNKNOWN Functional requirements ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah I think that would be it then . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN So we we can go for So we can go for the look-and-feel of the the left example , and then a screen on top of it . 
UNKNOWN I have no idea . 
UNKNOWN You didn't put it in ? 
UNKNOWN Or it's not really English . 
UNKNOWN That w . 
UNKNOWN Let me check . 
UNKNOWN I know . 
UNKNOWN Uh kick off . 
UNKNOWN Oh working design I got it . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Here you go . 
UNKNOWN Alright how do I uh skip pages? 
UNKNOWN Just uh press uh yeah . 
UNKNOWN The keys yeah ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
UNKNOWN Um yeah well I was working on this before I got my information . 
UNKNOWN So I was just working off the top of my head and using my colin common knowledge about uh remote controls . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN And well the info on the website which came too late . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um so I didn't really know what kind of functions we had to put into it yet . 
UNKNOWN So uh uh this is basically an overview of what we discussed in our last uh meeting . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Those were my uh starting points . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Uh I was working on a s yeah on a schedule , and I was supposed to do it like this . 
UNKNOWN But um yeah then uh the information came and it was kind of exact with all the steps in the remote control that I had to follow , so I was trying to organise them for myself . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN And then make the the design , a the actual design , but I never came around to do that . 
UNKNOWN Design ? 
UNKNOWN Design yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So I'm not really sure what I'm supposed to say about it . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN I mean everything speaks for itself I guess . 
UNKNOWN Mean you press a button um the it tru goes , it sends a signal to a chip , which uh translates it into infrared signal of certin spatial frequencies . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah frequency . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And uh or temporal fr frequencies actually . 
UNKNOWN And then uh through a uh transformer , it the signal gets boosted and then sent to the to the receiver on the T_V_ and the T_V_ will translate it into a function . 
UNKNOWN Yeah decoder . 
UNKNOWN Um Yeah well this was actually all I got around to do . 
UNKNOWN Blank . 
UNKNOWN Yeah okay . 
UNKNOWN I mean I dunno if I'm too slow for this stuff , but uh Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Work harder . 
UNKNOWN Okay shou should we make a list of the of all the functions we want uh Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Whatever . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah we want to incorporate in uh into it . 
UNKNOWN Um for those that didn't see yet um the basic new requirements of the management were no teletext , only for T_V_ . 
UNKNOWN Uh it should be designed for a use g uh group below forty , but I don't think it's w wrong if we can uh target the current customer group as well . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN And uh the corporate identity should be clear in the design of the remote control . 
UNKNOWN And we have to decide on the functions , and on the , let's see what was it , uh the target group . 
UNKNOWN We have to make be clear what that is . 
UNKNOWN group of users , or because it says below forty I mean . 
UNKNOWN Yeah users . 
UNKNOWN Yeah so I think it's easy but Yeah it's below forty so we can decide where to Okay . 
UNKNOWN I guess that's that's the tar yeah uh or male and female Uh six the marketing research started on s on the age of sixteen . 
UNKNOWN But uh it's it's also for children or just uh Okay . 
UNKNOWN Sixteen to twenty five , twenty five to thirty five , thirty five to forty five , something like that . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So um How do you mean ? 
UNKNOWN So below forty is okay . 
UNKNOWN But we need an lower level which to s uh focus . 
UNKNOWN So is it from sixteen to forty ? 
UNKNOWN Is it from twenty to forty ? 
UNKNOWN Is it from thirty ? 
UNKNOWN Uh sixteen to forty . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah ? 
UNKNOWN Well I I guess people of sixteen are are quite used to technology . 
UNKNOWN We we have to And if we have a larger public we have uh yeah more options to to uh sell our product . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So they they adapt to it pretty soon I guess . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah so what we might wanna do is uh yeah cust I have customised the screen functions , if you know what I mean . 
UNKNOWN The uh younger users are more acquainted with these kind of machines so they can use more advanced functions . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN But maybe elderly people don't understand it so well , so they need a simpler remote . 
UNKNOWN Design . 
UNKNOWN And yeah that you can choose what the design displays , or wha whatever . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah that's that's why uh I wanted to to make yeah two uh different uh yeah groups of functions . 
UNKNOWN The the simple functions for for the the whole public , and the the advanced options for the younger people yeah who are more yeah experienced with uh Na I w I should uh put uh the the yeah the extra advanced options on the onto the onscreen display . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Experienced yeah . 
UNKNOWN And maybe y Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But uh all incorporated in the screen or or just on the remote itself ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah like like you have a visual of the of the brightness with with a kind of sliding bar and a bus and and stuff like that for sound and and vis and and visuals ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So is you should have a menu for all the the functions you don't use regular and which are Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh you can make a if you make a drawing. 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Aye yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh Uh . 
UNKNOWN Shall I uh Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh black's okay . 
UNKNOWN And drawit very big . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN It's okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN no , it doesn't have line control , so Yeah we get the The remote , yeah ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah well , this is basically uh it's alright the remote ? 
UNKNOWN The remote ? 
UNKNOWN Um well usually the power button is on top I guess . 
UNKNOWN Basic . 
UNKNOWN Is on top . 
UNKNOWN Which should be easy , easily reached with the thumb . 
UNKNOWN Yeah so it should fit right in into your hand . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN L left top or right uh top ? 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN T I s should said right . 
UNKNOWN Right top . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , right . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN I most people are right-handed so maybe left-handed special addition , but okay . 
UNKNOWN Because yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah definitely . 
UNKNOWN If you put it like like here . 
UNKNOWN Or something . 
UNKNOWN I dunno . 
UNKNOWN Um then you could put a screen , like on a mobile phone , also on top I guess . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah but if you are using the the normal functions , the the basic functions , you normally press them on the u yeah . 
UNKNOWN Do the also with the thumb . 
UNKNOWN So it should be a little bit longer so that you can put your uh thumb , also reach the middle . 
UNKNOWN Or you should screen at the bottom and then you can see it very clearly . 
UNKNOWN Okay so y yeah you have you have it in your hand , and the screen is below , and the buttons are in the middle . 
UNKNOWN You you need to be able to hold it so Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay for example if you put the screen here , it's more about the functions now than the than the layout. 
UNKNOWN Yeah okay that's true . 
UNKNOWN Layout. 
UNKNOWN That's for the I can't help it . 
UNKNOWN Doesn't work too well . 
UNKNOWN It's uh it's bent . 
UNKNOWN You broke it . 
UNKNOWN . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN . 
UNKNOWN Man . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN Yeah okay . 
UNKNOWN Okay you get it . 
UNKNOWN Uh for example if y if you put all the Right . 
UNKNOWN You want the normal piece of paper? 
UNKNOWN And you have a pen ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And might be easier huh ? 
UNKNOWN Maybe this . 
UNKNOWN kind of works . 
UNKNOWN Yeah ? 
UNKNOWN Like if you have like uh ten buttons for for all the for all the channels , um and here one for for Yeah that that usually uh like here , here , here , here . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFUSION Uh . 
UNKNOWN And the for flipping up and down . 
UNKNOWN Yeah yeah . 
UNKNOWN And volume control . 
UNKNOWN Yeah I Yeah exactly . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So you have up and down for the for the channels , and left and right for the volume uh Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And left to right . 
UNKNOWN And those can also be used for the menu . 
UNKNOWN I thought but this is really your department , that we need just the functional display and four cursors . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah okay but this is function so if you can use them for multiple things For the menu . 
UNKNOWN And you you have most of the time you have one button in the middle . 
UNKNOWN And Yeah okay . 
UNKNOWN It says menu , and then if you press it you the screen gets activated and then you can use these buttons to scroll up and down and left and right to go into functon and then just mo most of the time this menu button is also like okay , to to confirm a a kind of action . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So you scroll into it , okay . 
UNKNOWN You select a function like v like uh bass . 
UNKNOWN You just adjust it with these two buttons . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Then okay to confirm , and then uh on on each on each screen there's there should be an option to go back to a to a upper level . 
UNKNOWN And then finally say okay , exit . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Or or one button to exit it . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh in one time I dunno , that's not really my department . 
UNKNOWN That's more your uh your department to to uh to Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And do we need a a logo on our uh remote control , or On the left uh top yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But it should be if the screen is here then the logo should be like on on top , yeah . 
UNKNOWN I mean it's uh Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah but that depends on where you put the screen . 
UNKNOWN But it's essential that there is a screen . 
UNKNOWN Yeah I mean the position of the screen is also more essential than I mean we we look where we have space left and then put the logo over there . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And for the speech uh recognition part , if we want to incorporate that , we need a microphone . 
UNKNOWN But um Yeah so it should be I mean if you have it in your hand here , should be on top somewhere , maybe . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN This would be uh No that's not s sure so uh we need a display . 
UNKNOWN Why did we wanna put the display in the bottom ? 
UNKNOWN I mean i That's not sure but it's Yeah I mean a screen on top looks more lo logical to me . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah may maybe because you're Yeah okay but only for the basic functi if you're going to use the advanced option , you're going to press the the menu button and then yeah . 
UNKNOWN Because yeah if you use the functions your hand will block the display . 
UNKNOWN Normal for logical t Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Also because people use m mobile phones and they also have the screen on top . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah they're used to it . 
UNKNOWN Okay the yeah . 
UNKNOWN So you you just have to reach a little bit for the power button . 
UNKNOWN That's possible . 
UNKNOWN I mean if you grab it . 
UNKNOWN On once it's on it's on . 
UNKNOWN But most most of the times if a if if a T_V_'s on standby people just press a channel to put it on . 
UNKNOWN You don't need the power button . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , okay . 
UNKNOWN Okay we put it on top . 
UNKNOWN So we put this on top , and then make the corporate logo like over here . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN R_R_ . 
UNKNOWN And j and the microphone , I mean it can be very small . 
UNKNOWN If you look at your mobile phones are some stripes , little little holes . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Maybe on the top or even on the side . 
UNKNOWN Yeah maybe on the side . 
UNKNOWN I mean if the if the microphone is good . 
UNKNOWN Yeah but then it's possible that you cover it with your hand so I think that top is the best option . 
UNKNOWN True . 
UNKNOWN Yeah okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So on the on the top is better . 
UNKNOWN But if you uh if you hold the ma the remote like this , if you put it on the top on the side I dunno . 
UNKNOWN Yeah okay . 
UNKNOWN Should be able to work . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Depends on the sensitivity of the microphone , but I think that's okay . 
UNKNOWN Never mind . 
UNKNOWN . 
UNKNOWN Can we leave this up to you ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah it doesn't matter that much . 
UNKNOWN So but um the screen is on top ? 
UNKNOWN Which functions did we have left ? 
UNKNOWN I mean this is basically numbers , volume , uh channel up and down . 
UNKNOWN Volume . 
UNKNOWN Up . 
UNKNOWN Channel up and down , and the control of the advanced options . 
UNKNOWN Screen is over there . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So maybe it , we should decide what advanced options we want to put in the L_C_D_ screen . 
UNKNOWN If we Yeah it it's just a remote control so Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN That's uh that's a good one . 
UNKNOWN Yeah so we we needed to integrate the sound and uh and image options right ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah so sounds ? 
UNKNOWN Like uh bass uh so we need kind of an equaliser . 
UNKNOWN Sound ? 
UNKNOWN If you Yeah treble , middl middle , bass or something . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Equaliser . 
UNKNOWN So if you have sound But not too advanced . 
UNKNOWN I mean most T_V_s use only treble and bass . 
UNKNOWN Yeah and they're They're not used often so Yeah just Yeah sounds . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It's uh pretty hard to write . 
UNKNOWN Ah as . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Okay but you have sound ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah just oh y you have digital uh better write it down over there yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN . 
UNKNOWN Of course . 
UNKNOWN So you have sound . 
UNKNOWN I'm just a secretary . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Coffee ? 
UNKNOWN Uh yeah sound and then within sound I guess treble and bass ? 
UNKNOWN Yes please . 
UNKNOWN Treble bass . 
UNKNOWN the mono stereo option ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh Pitch I believe , yeah . 
UNKNOWN And there there was something else also . 
UNKNOWN Also . 
UNKNOWN And then pitch . 
UNKNOWN Pitch . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But pitch , isn't that yeah that's the the height of the tone . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN The fr yeah the frequency of the tones , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah okay , wh why would you use that ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah and mono stereo . 
UNKNOWN Yeah isn't that that depends on the on the signal of the of what program you're watching . 
UNKNOWN If people like talk like uh Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN And also the tuning part ? 
UNKNOWN Programming part . 
UNKNOWN Yeah programming . 
UNKNOWN Uh so we have sound , yeah ? 
UNKNOWN So channel programming ? 
UNKNOWN Channel programming . 
UNKNOWN And yeah in the functionality of the no no of the remote uh do do we want uh the buttons to make sound when you press them ? 
UNKNOWN Television uh itself uh Mm . 
UNKNOWN As a confirmation or whatever you know ? 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN I dunno . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN I think it g it gets annoying . 
UNKNOWN I mean most mobile phones used that in the beginning but Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN We we could make an option for it , but uh you can disable s Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Under the a yeah advanced option menu you can put those things . 
UNKNOWN But uh the the television itself has also the the options brightness and uh screen colour etcetera . 
UNKNOWN So yeah . 
UNKNOWN Contrast yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah but people don't want to sit on their knees on their knees in front of their television with only three buttons then it's very hard to y yeah contrast and brightness ? 
CONFUSION Mm . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN Uh , so contrast , bright , uh And the others were in your presentationright ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah those are the most used I guess . 
UNKNOWN If you look at your monitor . 
UNKNOWN So I can just copythose ? 
UNKNOWN Well yeah well I guess that these were the only ones , I guess . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN It's easy . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But so we have we have T_V_ options , which is all this . 
UNKNOWN I will look it up . 
UNKNOWN Yeah the button options and the L_C_D_ options . 
UNKNOWN The sound , sound and image . 
UNKNOWN And you have in that uh the indeed the remote control options . 
UNKNOWN Indeed . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So we need two menus kind of thing . 
UNKNOWN Yeah you have basically a button menu , which you can use directly , uh according to the old principle . 
UNKNOWN Uh-huh . 
UNKNOWN And the L_C_D_ options are activated by some some software options , thats communicates with the infrared uh decoder yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah with the chip and then I mean Uh yeah . 
UNKNOWN So you You have an additional processor and and software part . 
UNKNOWN Well yeah we have power button , whether that's present . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
UNKNOWN Compared to o Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Channel volume selection present . 
UNKNOWN Uh numbers present . 
UNKNOWN Yeah a audio settings , mono , stereo , pitch , bass , treble . 
UNKNOWN L_ s Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Screen settings , brightness and colour . 
UNKNOWN Colour . 
UNKNOWN Yeah I I call it contrast . 
UNKNOWN Yeah con contrast is Yeah okay , colour and brightness . 
UNKNOWN Yeah I make it c colour . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um and what you say , channel settings or channel programming ? 
UNKNOWN So you you have an option to to start scanning all the frequencies , and when it encounters one , well it shows on your T_V_ . 
UNKNOWN Yeah and automatically um Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN And then you can um Uh and then you can select uh a number in your remote on which you want to save it . 
UNKNOWN Yeah so I've g channel program is autoseek ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , autoseek . 
UNKNOWN Uh name a channel , or Oh they get automatic names , okay . 
UNKNOWN Well most T_V_s automatically display the name , which they get through the cable . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So you only have to choose the position on your It only has to match the the channel frequency on your T_V_ , with with the with the position on your T_V_ and and so your remote . 
UNKNOWN . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah but can you also say I want f uh Veronica on the channel number uh five or Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Help . 
UNKNOWN If you already programmed it . 
UNKNOWN If you want to move it . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah that should be possible too . 
UNKNOWN How do you call that ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah how do you call that ? 
UNKNOWN Mm ? 
UNKNOWN Wait you you should be able to to browse through a list or something , which w displays all the all the values , all the channels which are possible . 
UNKNOWN Channels ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I mean like one to f thirty of or ninety or whatever . 
UNKNOWN Ninety nine or something . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Just browse through it and then um in some kind of way see if it if it if it is programmed . 
UNKNOWN S swap channels ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Can I call it that ? 
UNKNOWN Swap channels . 
UNKNOWN Swap's good option . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Uh other functions ? 
UNKNOWN So you most of the time if you if you swap it S uh let's say for example you have uh R_T_L_ five on on channel five . 
UNKNOWN And Veronica on channel eight and you want to move Veronica to channel five , um most of the times you override the previous uh the previous one . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Well that's 's up to uh Mister User Interface Designer . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It's it's pretty uh yeah I mean you have to look on on the menu on the T_V_ . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN working design . 
UNKNOWN Doch . 
UNKNOWN Also . 
UNKNOWN That's you're Yeah but also , which buttons you have to press to get a certain result ? 
UNKNOWN He only has to figure out how it has to look . 
UNKNOWN And how to use Yeah okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And the working design was to specify how ph the physical interation between the components was , as I believe . 
UNKNOWN But You did your homework . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But um yeah . 
UNKNOWN Or or is it too hard to to ju to just do it all on your remote ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN To programme the channels ? 
UNKNOWN No no . 
UNKNOWN No I don't think so . 
UNKNOWN No that's Okay On the uh yeah can you i make a a mapwith with all the yeah 'cause it's now there are lots and lots of documentsand The the layoutof the remote control ? 
UNKNOWN It should be able to do any remote . 
CONFUSION Uh . 
UNKNOWN But I think the communication with the television is difficult . 
UNKNOWN But that's not our part . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN We don't have to design a protocol so No that's the Yeah . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN That's true . 
UNKNOWN That's true . 
UNKNOWN Thank god . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So we have a figure a figure out a way to to do that easily . 
UNKNOWN I mean th the autoseek is is not a problem . 
UNKNOWN I mean you uh you uh current channel and then then it just says , uh on which number do you want to save this , and you just press a number on your remote , and then say confirm , okay , and then it's it's saved . 
UNKNOWN It's easier , it's it's it's harder to , if you have already programmed it , to to swap . 
UNKNOWN So we have to think of something for that . 
UNKNOWN So but Um The User Interface Designer can design a menu for all these function I put them on the . 
UNKNOWN Yeah k kind of structure into layers . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah I can . 
UNKNOWN I'll just try to reorganise uh things . 
UNKNOWN So And and the layoutof of the thing itself . 
UNKNOWN Um So you design the basic function menu for the L_C_D_ screen ? 
UNKNOWN Uh um I think th I think the yeah the layoutof the screen and I think you can concentrate more on the button placement and the placement of the uh screen itself on the . 
UNKNOWN . 
UNKNOWN Isn't that more the the u uh the user interface part ? 
UNKNOWN No I d I think that's more in . 
UNKNOWN Uh all the functional uh aspects of the remote I think are in my department . 
UNKNOWN Maybe more on Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I have to know what it has to do , so if you wanna you know the changing the channels kind of s thing is , I have to integrate that in the design . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So he's layoutand you're function . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Form function okay . 
UNKNOWN I think that's a that's a good separation . 
UNKNOWN But do I have to to uh to yeah to make the the menu layoutalso ? 
UNKNOWN Or Are you going to do that ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah I guess so . 
UNKNOWN Yeah ? 
UNKNOWN I I'm going to make yeah o okay . 
UNKNOWN I think i that's your department yes , because w he already knows what Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah we have to kind of work together . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN If if I make the the the yeah the menu like , I have to state which function has to be in the menu , and then you have to decide , it's , in a in a way that b is user-friendly . 
UNKNOWN But we're not allowed . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Y you you are going to make a list of what functions are uh are going to to be on the the screen , the menu screen . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And I'm going to make a a nice menu uh with with pagesand yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think yeah . 
UNKNOWN With with some l with some layers in it . 
UNKNOWN So some menus . 
UNKNOWN Yeah and also make clear which buttons to press to get certain result , because that's always the difficulty . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Every device has its own Menu okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well I guess this this button , the the the okay , menu okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Or you can incorporate two uh difference uh different buttons . 
UNKNOWN Uh like uh for your mobile phone . 
UNKNOWN Um so this is only for to get in the menu , or to exit it . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN And then one to confirm , and one to go one step back . 
UNKNOWN Back . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So it's like the the save button on your your mobile phone , if you have a Nokia or like that . 
UNKNOWN Or the or the no button . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN To go one step back you it's only two extra buttons , but if it if it's very clear that they are for the screen Yeah because this this is used for both . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN W we Uh I think we have to to group , to make two groups . 
UNKNOWN Um the one group for the for the display , and one group for the basic functions , and Yeah okay but we we have a m yeah but maybe that's that's not uh yeah if you're if you're z zapping uh with your uh yeah remote control , you can press the the menu button , and then you are suddenly into the the yeah the display . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah but they're incorporated ? 
UNKNOWN Up and down is Smart ? 
UNKNOWN Into your screen . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So you l should leave the menu button out of here . 
UNKNOWN You wanna separate uh . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And and just put it under the screen , the screen Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Put it on top . 
UNKNOWN Yeah j just just group group the yeah we make these the advanced functions and these the basic functions . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So we make a yeah a line between them . 
UNKNOWN But we should place the screen on top , right ? 
UNKNOWN Well But that's uh J Jurgen's department . 
UNKNOWN F oh yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay yeah we swap uh Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So we make it a Okay . 
UNKNOWN You just you just find out and . 
UNKNOWN You just make the layout. 
UNKNOWN You do we do the extra two buttons or not ? 
UNKNOWN Uh Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think you should . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It's easier . 
UNKNOWN If you put too many functions in one button it gets confusing . 
UNKNOWN Yeah okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN That's true . 
UNKNOWN So we have a a menu button and a s Okay . 
UNKNOWN And to , okay and back , also . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay and back button . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , or confirm and back . 
UNKNOWN And of course the four arrows . 
UNKNOWN Whatever . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN But those are still y doubly used . 
UNKNOWN Should we save this picture , or or you know what it looks like ? 
UNKNOWN Both the L_C_D_ Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah I'm I'm not s clear about uh the the extra two buttons . 
UNKNOWN We have a menu button and That's the the one with the yeah okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN That that just to to activate the screen . 
UNKNOWN So And then with these buttons , woa , y you navigate . 
UNKNOWN Menu button access the menu in the L_C_D_ screen . 
UNKNOWN You can navigate . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN But you can also navigate the channels . 
UNKNOWN And the volume . 
UNKNOWN Okay so that that's not uh Yeah that Those are multifunctional . 
UNKNOWN Those are both both yeah . 
UNKNOWN Hey is it interesting for users if we put LED lights under the buttons ? 
UNKNOWN So that if you uh press on the menu function that only the buttons that are used for the menu are ligh li light up . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN L l litten up yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN That's very good idea . 
UNKNOWN Oh five minutes . 
UNKNOWN N Yeah and then it's also easier to integrate several functions in one button . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
UNKNOWN Yeah that's a good idea because then it becomes clear which buttons are active now , which you can use . 
UNKNOWN Light uh Yeah sure . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um Anything else ? 
UNKNOWN So Those buttons are are lit up . 
UNKNOWN I think not . 
UNKNOWN But just one thing . 
UNKNOWN Should we use those two ? 
UNKNOWN Them ? 
UNKNOWN Or only this to to scroll ? 
UNKNOWN And then use the two functional buttons to confirm , to go into something ? 
UNKNOWN I've Volume . 
UNKNOWN Oh no we have to use this to adjust some some bars ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah keep it optional 'cause maybe you can you know go left to right and up and down in a in one menu . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And maybe we should use this also as an okay button , still . 
UNKNOWN And then just only a back button . 
UNKNOWN Well we have those buttons . 
UNKNOWN No Yeah . 
UNKNOWN The pr the problem with the okay button in the middle is , sorry sorry , uh is uh if you're pressing up and down , you can easily press the okay once you , when you're not already at your choice . 
UNKNOWN We use all four . 
UNKNOWN Yeah okay go ahead . 
UNKNOWN Yeah ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So maybe make one uh one okay button and and one navigation button . 
UNKNOWN And one back . 
UNKNOWN Yeah that was already decided . 
UNKNOWN Yeah the with with the the channel and the volume uh yeah m a multifunctional navigation button . 
UNKNOWN Okay that's what we decided earlier on . 
UNKNOWN Yeah okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Right okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So yeah I wanna close down . 
UNKNOWN You wanna close down huh ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I have to , sorry . 
UNKNOWN That's okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN it's not because I don't like you but yh we have lunch break , and then we can work for thirty minutes , and I have to write very fast to make the minich min minutes. 
UNKNOWN Already . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And then uh we'll see I don't know . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
UNKNOWN How m how long is the lunchbreak ? 
UNKNOWN We have to ask . 
UNKNOWN Nobody told me . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN But do we have to write uh to write down uh the our stuff now ? 
UNKNOWN Or first lunchbreak ? 
UNKNOWN No I th believe there's first lunch break . 
UNKNOWN Because I I've everything in my head now so Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Or you can just Yeah ? 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN I think you can put uh the laptop back in the room and 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN This is Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yes sir . 
UNKNOWN Time pressure . 
UNKNOWN Yeah it's a lot of pressure . 
UNKNOWN Sorry for my uh not finished presentationuh . 
UNKNOWN That's okay . 
UNKNOWN Oh yeah . 
UNKNOWN Oh no no . 
UNKNOWN Yeah we'll kick your ass later . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN Bring it on . 
CONFUSION Uh . 
UNKNOWN I don't know if it works but it should be saved . 
UNKNOWN Aye Y you saved it ? 
UNKNOWN Does it save automatically in the project folder ? 
UNKNOWN Or Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It's uh Should be here . 
UNKNOWN We'll see . 
UNKNOWN Just put back my laptop . 
UNKNOWN Smart board . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
UNKNOWN Don't know if you can use it but Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah you can open it with the picture preview or stuff like that . 
UNKNOWN And uh we have to make uh some maps with uh with the all the the data we uh gathered . 
UNKNOWN I try to organise it by these three . 
UNKNOWN . 
UNKNOWN Yeah yeah yeah . 
UNKNOWN It's it's just my own mapso I put everything into the But you got some extra information uh Okay . 
UNKNOWN I don't really mind . 
UNKNOWN I just put the minuteshere and we'll see . 
UNKNOWN Yeah that's in the functional design uh folder . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah that's just basically what I just showed . 
UNKNOWN But where do you did you get the newsflash ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah I got it by yeah . 
UNKNOWN You're the only one uh okay . 
UNKNOWN I'm gonna get kicked if I don't do it so Make me proud . 
UNKNOWN internet . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I'll try to . 
UNKNOWN So first we have a lunchbreak now ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
UNKNOWN I believe so . 
UNKNOWN just ask . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN I dunno where she . 
GREETING Hello . 
UNKNOWN . 
UNKNOWN . 
UNKNOWN Yes , I made it . 
UNKNOWN English from now on . 
UNKNOWN Drawingor Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah just testing . 
UNKNOWN Mm ? 
UNKNOWN Just kidding . 
UNKNOWN English . 
UNKNOWN . 
UNKNOWN So annoying . 
UNKNOWN Break is over . 
UNKNOWN Ooh it works . 
UNKNOWN Whoo . 
UNKNOWN Spicy . 
UNKNOWN Spicy . 
UNKNOWN Where are are all the other presentations? 
UNKNOWN I just put it in the in the shared folder so it should be yeah I think so . 
UNKNOWN The conceptual or Ah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , conceptual design . 
UNKNOWN What or whatever does it No no no , can you go back one ? 
UNKNOWN Because I see only my own presentationyeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh 'cause it has to be PowerPointpre yeah components design , that's it . 
UNKNOWN This ? 
UNKNOWN I'll just put it in there . 
UNKNOWN So , he's coming . 
UNKNOWN . 
UNKNOWN I did get a bit more done than the last time , 'cause I knew that I didn't have time so I just copyand paste everything into the Sometimes I have these pop-ups or these sounds and there's nothing there , and also with I don't know how to use PowerPoint, so it takes me forever to get something done with it . 
UNKNOWN Or not . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Oh okay . 
UNKNOWN Ah , I can't cut and paste it into the other folder but Move to meeting room . 
UNKNOWN Ah . 
UNKNOWN She . 
UNKNOWN You can look at the final report, 'cause I have to record everything we are deciding and such , so I'm trying to write it down between everything else . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN Yeah me too , . 
UNKNOWN I I've got the same problem as well . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Here we go again . 
UNKNOWN Welcome . 
UNKNOWN Uh we have again three presentationsand then we have to decide on what concepts the mobile phone has to uh f the remote control has to support . 
UNKNOWN Thi Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So who wants go . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN Who wants to start ? 
UNKNOWN Yes ? 
UNKNOWN Me first again or yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah sure . 
SURPRISE Oh .
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN Doesn't matter . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN No problem Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
UNKNOWN Did you open it already or no . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN Ah . 
UNKNOWN Ah . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN So welcome to the marketing presentationonce again . 
UNKNOWN Um this time about trendwatching . 
UNKNOWN Uh well there has been inv investigation again , in the in the remote control market . 
UNKNOWN Uh it shows a number of developments . 
UNKNOWN Uh I will address them uh in a moment . 
UNKNOWN Um fashion watch watchers uh have detected the trends for young public , because that's our public . 
UNKNOWN Um well fruit and vegetables will be will be the most important theme for clothing , uh shoes and furniture . 
UNKNOWN And the feel of the material is expected to be spongey . 
UNKNOWN So um the developments I will address them oh yeah well this is the fruit and vegetables looks of fresh bright colours . 
UNKNOWN So to give you an idea . 
UNKNOWN Um well the developments ? 
UNKNOWN Uh development one . 
UNKNOWN Uh well most important aspect for remote control happens to be a fancy look-and-feel . 
UNKNOWN Instead of the current uh functional look-and-feel . 
UNKNOWN Um well fancy stands for an original look-and-feel of the case and the interface . 
UNKNOWN And the second most important aspect is that a remote control should be technological uh innovative . 
UNKNOWN Um well it stands for the use of technical features that do not exist in current remote controls . 
UNKNOWN I think we pretty much covered that with our screen and um and speech recognition , so I don't expect that to be a problem . 
UNKNOWN Sound . 
UNKNOWN Yeah yeah uh uh . 
UNKNOWN And the third development um is that the remote control should be easy to use . 
UNKNOWN Um Well the first aspect uh was twice as important as the second aspect,w which was twice as important as the third aspect . 
UNKNOWN So um that kind of gets you this ratios . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So fancy look-and-feel uh is the most important uh point of attention . 
UNKNOWN . 
UNKNOWN Uh so the fruits and vegetables in combination with the spongey material . 
UNKNOWN Um well technolog technological innovation , we've covered that pretty much I guess . 
UNKNOWN Um and easy to use , I don't think that will be problem . 
UNKNOWN So my point of attention is especially this part . 
UNKNOWN That this will be a crux . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So that was the marketing uh presentation. 
UNKNOWN I had only one documentleft . 
UNKNOWN And shall I go first ? 
UNKNOWN So I Yeah ? 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN I I don't mi I don't mind . 
UNKNOWN That's Do you want to go first ? 
UNKNOWN So kind of this So a k a small example . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah yeah sure . 
NEGATION No . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Kind of this this look . 
UNKNOWN Uh nothing about the buttons but just sponge kind of thing , and and some fruit and colours I dunno . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Just made a quick design . 
CONFIRMATION Cool . 
UNKNOWN It's better than than my uh drawing. 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
UNKNOWN Yeah you're just the user interface hmm ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah okay but I have to design the Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh components . 
UNKNOWN Yeah layout. 
UNKNOWN Oh no . 
UNKNOWN Yeah okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It's okay . 
UNKNOWN You probably opened it . 
UNKNOWN Yeah true . 
UNKNOWN Um Alright . 
UNKNOWN F_ five . 
UNKNOWN F_ five . 
UNKNOWN So I'm dealing with the components design . 
UNKNOWN Um let's see . 
UNKNOWN I uh used some design examples we had uh from similar products . 
UNKNOWN And I used uh possibilities from our manufacturing department about current components which will have to be implemented in the design . 
UNKNOWN That's why I had to , wanted to go first . 
UNKNOWN Well they gave me um an idea about what people want . 
UNKNOWN We're f mainly focusing on this group , but I want to make the distinction clear . 
UNKNOWN Uh I could not drag the pictures into the the slidesso s so I don't have examples of how it looks like . 
UNKNOWN But it comes down to what you uh what you think we should do with the spongey and the fruity looking uh type . 
UNKNOWN If you , the young dynamic people want soft primary colours uh , which looks like fruits you know , you can and shapes that are curved and not uh solid straight lines anymore . 
UNKNOWN So this basically um yeah goes on to what you were mentioning earlier . 
UNKNOWN There is a lot of um factors involved in choosing the components . 
UNKNOWN There's a lot of options that we have to discuss . 
UNKNOWN Uh for example the energy source . 
UNKNOWN we have four types . 
UNKNOWN The basic battery . 
UNKNOWN Uh we have a hand dynamo , which we yeah we Dutch refer to it as the kneipgatt . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh the kinetic provision of energy which means if you move the thing , if you shake it . 
UNKNOWN Which will be fun for toddlers right , if they wanna use the And uh of course solar cells . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But I dunno how we would use that into the design of the actual product . 
UNKNOWN Wi an indoors . 
UNKNOWN So uh my yeah also also in you know countries where there's n isn't much light like in Scandinavia , they wouldn't be y able to use it half of the year you know . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN Yeah okay . 
UNKNOWN Calculator's can do it . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So that's not cool either . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So um for the uh a case , there's uh the traditional uncurved flat hard case . 
UNKNOWN Single curved , which means that it has uh curves in one dimension . 
UNKNOWN Or the double curved . 
UNKNOWN Um I wasn't able to finish my uh personal preferences sheet, but well you know that we will have to go for the double curved 'cause it's daring and different from what we have now . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh the case materials . 
UNKNOWN Well we have all kinds of hard uh materials like the the hard plastic , the wood and the titanium . 
UNKNOWN I would definitely go for rubber 'cause it fits most in what people wanna see nowadays . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um poo , this is a lot of text . 
UNKNOWN I wasn't able to organise this yet . 
UNKNOWN We have yeah several uh interface designs. 
UNKNOWN Uh we can use a scroll buttons for the menus , but we already kind of decided to go for the f for the pushbuttons , for the the arrow buttons . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Pushbuttons . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So that's not really interesting . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Electronics ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , maybe we wanna decide on what electronics to use the advanced chip I think is easiest to implement uh for the production , 'cause they they can printit better . 
UNKNOWN Um Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think this is about it . 
UNKNOWN Yeah I was working on some per personal preferences . 
UNKNOWN I first uh chose for the battery , 'cause yeah I'm traditional and that's the most obvious , easiest choice to go to . 
UNKNOWN But I really think that we should maybe uh think about the kinetic energy , where you have to move the thing to be able to use it . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN As an optional uh feature . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Or combine uh both with a with one uh Okay . 
UNKNOWN I guess we can only choose one . 
UNKNOWN Uh I think you can only fit one uh source of energy on the Yeah I didn't receive any info uh . 
UNKNOWN Yeah maybe we I can imagine that the kinetic uh type energy source would be more expensive to make . 
UNKNOWN But it is more longlasting , that the people don't have to ever buy batteries again . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And it's more fun . 
UNKNOWN And it's also more fun yeah . 
UNKNOWN I always chuck my uh remote control around , so Yeah y exactly . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , just playing with it and especially when the material's rubber . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It can be done , I mean , you can't harm it , so it's a perfect combination I guess . 
UNKNOWN S yeah it's safe . 
UNKNOWN And throw it . 
UNKNOWN You don't have to be scared about bouncing it off the g floor and breaking it or whatever . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So that's the end of it . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So So double curved is like this , this , this , or Mm . 
UNKNOWN Uh go ahead . 
UNKNOWN 'Kay next . 
UNKNOWN No it means curved in two dimensions . 
UNKNOWN So uh w single curved ? 
UNKNOWN Uh let's say would be a b square box , but then with curves on one dimension . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And double curved would means that it would have curves curves in every direction . 
UNKNOWN Also in in height ? 
UNKNOWN Uh Okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah okay . 
UNKNOWN Like three D_ . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Can we uh Yeah . 
UNKNOWN One one uh very important thing I was uh yeah thinking about is the speech uh option . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN We were going to use that . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So um Yeah um yeah that's one thing uh which I'm not sure uh of how to implement it uh into the remote control . 
UNKNOWN Design ? 
UNKNOWN Well the visual representation is not there with speech but you can Yeah . 
UNKNOWN No okay but it has to be combined with with the menu uh for functions and So okay . 
UNKNOWN Just yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think you can just uh match the speech commands with the functions that are already present . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So I don't think you have to design anything else for that . 
UNKNOWN Yeah with the programme . 
UNKNOWN But do uh j do we uh do the speech just for the basic options , for the simple buttons ? 
UNKNOWN Both . 
UNKNOWN For for everything , also for the advanced options ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Uh we have this very uh basic uh trendy design . 
UNKNOWN Everybody says it so that's what's uh yeah um Yeah in the in the last uh meeting we uh we were yeah putting the the simple and the advanced options separated . 
UNKNOWN That's yeah obvious . 
UNKNOWN Um yeah . 
UNKNOWN Pressing the the menu option uh will disable uh all other options on your uh remote control . 
UNKNOWN And only the the L_C_D_ panel will uh light up and then you can only uh change the yeah the options . 
UNKNOWN And and the and the buttons that you need to control it , I guess . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um yeah design has to be very attractive but that's your your op your yeah . 
UNKNOWN you have to uh delete this but this is the the the simple uh layout. 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh display on the upper side with the the menu button and maybe a some sort of cancel button or save button . 
UNKNOWN That would be the back . 
UNKNOWN I'm The back . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Back and okay . 
UNKNOWN Back and okay . 
UNKNOWN Back and okay yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh What ? 
UNKNOWN You did read the minutesI wrote ? 
UNKNOWN You did read the minutesI wrote ? 
UNKNOWN A little bit I think but not not everything w Okay . 
UNKNOWN I And rubber . 
UNKNOWN Oh okay 'cause I pretty much summed up all the buttons there were . 
UNKNOWN So I hate doing work for nothing . 
UNKNOWN Oh I uh didn't read that . 
UNKNOWN But But this is the the basic uh design uh for the for the m yeah for the buttons . 
UNKNOWN Um I wanted to to categorise everything . 
UNKNOWN Uh with a speech display uh yeah , sound , everything you you noted in your uh minutes. 
UNKNOWN Um every pushbutton has uh has its own uh LED light . 
UNKNOWN So you can uh yeah change uh m make it more trendy for for younger people . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN And uh if there are older people they wanted more uh yeah more uh luxurous so that's an a also an option . 
UNKNOWN Um that was it . 
UNKNOWN That was it ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Uh again . 
UNKNOWN Ugh . 
UNKNOWN Okay so what we have to decide is what kind of components do we use ? 
UNKNOWN Uh energy source , chip type , case type . 
UNKNOWN And user interface . 
UNKNOWN But I didn't see a clear distinction between these so I think what we have is okay . 
UNKNOWN So we only , we already decided that kinetic would be the choice for energy . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN Uh the case would be doubly curved . 
UNKNOWN Rubber material . 
UNKNOWN So Rubber material . 
UNKNOWN Rubber material . 
UNKNOWN And that's the only thing we have left . 
UNKNOWN Yeah we need the the chip on printto be able to support the the screen and uh and f audio function . 
UNKNOWN Oh okay . 
UNKNOWN No it's easy . 
UNKNOWN So that's uh is that is that the advanced chip ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Advanced chip . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Wow . 
UNKNOWN Otherwise you would have a simple chip , just for pressing buttons . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But we need more . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
UNKNOWN Kinetic . 
UNKNOWN I'm just thinking , this is not my department , but I I'm not sure what this is gonna cost , to be able to m So 'cause we need to sell it for twenty five Euro a piece . 
UNKNOWN Too . 
UNKNOWN Double curved . 
UNKNOWN Uh I didn't get any info on this . 
UNKNOWN So Yeah . 
UNKNOWN . 
UNKNOWN That's gonna be difficult huh ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN The cost of making it should be twelve and a half ? 
UNKNOWN I have total here . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah yeah yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah I don't know . 
UNKNOWN I didn't get any information about that so Yeah . 
UNKNOWN . 
UNKNOWN We're going to produce it in uh China so it's no problem . 
UNKNOWN Child labour man , we love it . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , so it's cheap . 
UNKNOWN Who doesn't . 
UNKNOWN Uh let's see . 
UNKNOWN Is there a new thing ? 
UNKNOWN Um well the interface type supplements . 
UNKNOWN Yeah the interface , maybe can Ooh . 
UNKNOWN Uh it's it's quite difficult because we we haven't got all the options uh yeah . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN Uh do you have a picture of doubly curved case ? 
UNKNOWN And could you put that in the group folder ? 
UNKNOWN Um let me see . 
UNKNOWN Of the project folder . 
UNKNOWN Wait a sec . 
UNKNOWN If you go to your homepage or something , you should get your own information . 
UNKNOWN Yeah I'm going there now . 
UNKNOWN Inspiration . 
UNKNOWN I got my fresh and fyoo fruity uh picture uh also uh over there , so No . 
UNKNOWN Well Um yeah maybe it's Maybe it's easier Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Ah you didn't drawit yourself . 
UNKNOWN Ah . 
UNKNOWN Too less time . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , also the menu . 
UNKNOWN Yeah that that w Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN This is the the menu I was uh looking uh at . 
UNKNOWN Yeah I was thinking of that also , with with a with a uh arrow . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Arrow . 
UNKNOWN Arrow yeah . 
UNKNOWN So that indicates that there's an menu under that menu . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah perfect . 
UNKNOWN So Oh yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN . 
UNKNOWN Maybe it's easier if you guys come over here . 
UNKNOWN 'S the target group . 
UNKNOWN S yeah . 
UNKNOWN S see this is the the the standard traditional type , where the form uh yeah serves the function , you know . 
UNKNOWN Yeah sure . 
UNKNOWN It's like really basic . 
UNKNOWN But this m is more appealing to old people and we don't want that . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN This is what we're looking for . 
UNKNOWN And th that means curved in both dire dire uh dimensions . 
UNKNOWN Oh okay . 
UNKNOWN Not only like this but it has to be exactly . 
UNKNOWN I see . 
UNKNOWN Yeah also like this . 
UNKNOWN So you can hold it . 
UNKNOWN It has to be kind of instead of the PlayStation , the module . 
UNKNOWN It has to be like the the Game Cube , you know , where your thumbs would be laying in the instrument and it has to be nice to hold . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But it has also to it it has also to be uh luxurous uh for for yeah rich people . 
UNKNOWN And It ha Yeah but that's that's the the problem uh yeah the dilemma actually , 'cause we wanna appeal to the to the young public with fancy with flashy colours , and with a lot of shape . 
UNKNOWN Th this looks a little bit like like for only for children . 
UNKNOWN . 
UNKNOWN The children's story . 
UNKNOWN Yeah I've got it . 
UNKNOWN So Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Distinction . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And Yeah , and the and the rubber , it it will look cheap always , you know , with the There is mobile phones , in which you can change the colour also of the lights . 
UNKNOWN The colour Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay but the the colours , you you can make it uh make the colours with LEDs uh beneath the the buttons . 
UNKNOWN If you press a button and you can disable the the colour LEDs for for people that don't like it . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Maybe we should consider this function . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN To customise it and so I mean kids can make it look more flashy with different kinds of colours and people who want something , you know , different , or more uh design , they can go for one colour like uh for example this uh photo th camera . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Different . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Camera . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Cool . 
UNKNOWN S underwater uh yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah submarine . 
UNKNOWN Personally I think it's really ugly . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Just give me the thing that it's inside there maybe I'm too old for this stuff . 
UNKNOWN Well Yeah but this this the is for the . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Very cheap uh cheap look . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So those I think are all my oh . 
UNKNOWN Uh Ah yeah bright colours . 
UNKNOWN . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Also a kind of rubber uh Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And this is , this is with the curved that I mean . 
UNKNOWN That's singly curved . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah ? 
UNKNOWN That should be nice . 
UNKNOWN Well we could make a compromise between that . 
UNKNOWN But I don't know if it's worth the effort . 
UNKNOWN A compromise between what ? 
UNKNOWN Uh instead of doubly curved we take a single curved . 
UNKNOWN So to appeal a little more to the all the public . 
UNKNOWN So s Yeah there's only in in this dimension . 
UNKNOWN This , this would be uh single curved uh ? 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Like this . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So curvy or not . 
UNKNOWN Also . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah so we keep it singly c single curved then ? 
UNKNOWN Exactly . 
UNKNOWN Exactly . 
UNKNOWN Yeah that would be an option . 
UNKNOWN I don't know what you think . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think the I mean our aim is to make something different right ? 
UNKNOWN To make something new . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN I would go for the double curved . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN And I I'm I'm thinking uh you know uh a drawingpalette , where you have the shape for your thumb . 
UNKNOWN Yeah I'd agree . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN So it kind of holds nicely , something like that . 
UNKNOWN Yeah but if you if you make it more curved we we can make more and more options for buttons . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well this is really your decision but Yeah . 
UNKNOWN If you have uh it have it in your hand , you you you are not only um yeah you don't need one dimension but you can use other dimensions for pressing the the buttons . 
UNKNOWN As well . 
UNKNOWN You can make a trigger button or something like that . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Something to shoot at your television Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah or that that is the confirmation button or something , that you scroll with your thumb , with the arrows , and then confirm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN That's yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN That would be a nice way to use it but I mean , yeah , I'm thinking big already , and we need something that well that that you can able to use in one hand I think . 
UNKNOWN Different . 
UNKNOWN Stands out . 
UNKNOWN Or Oh yeah a one hand uh solution . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So from top view it looks kinda like this . 
UNKNOWN But from the side you you can have it also in a kind of shape . 
UNKNOWN Maybe because the the screen is on top you can have Maybe you can c have this kind of shape . 
UNKNOWN can turn it maybe . 
UNKNOWN To switch from buttons to interface hmm . 
UNKNOWN If you turn it a little . 
UNKNOWN . 
UNKNOWN . 
UNKNOWN A little upwards . 
UNKNOWN So that the screen is more towards yourself , so you can easily see your screen . 
UNKNOWN Oh yeah . 
UNKNOWN Least you can easily see it . 
UNKNOWN How about Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Well well you have it in your hand so it's a kind of an angle from your eyes to the screen . 
UNKNOWN So then you have double double curved in some way . 
UNKNOWN So this this is so the screen is positioned over here . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN Something like that . 
UNKNOWN And the buttons are more , well it's very thick now but That's uh that's Yeah ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah I understand what you mean . 
UNKNOWN How about we do a uh a pop-up screen , like the laptop . 
UNKNOWN If you can uh flip . 
UNKNOWN So that the only the simple functions will be visible at first . 
UNKNOWN That that you can press it and then it comes up ? 
UNKNOWN And then if you want Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Or But then the side view can be straight . 
UNKNOWN Something like that . 
UNKNOWN Uh so you have a the the side view . 
UNKNOWN If you have a pop-up screen . 
UNKNOWN But I dunno if that's too expensive . 
UNKNOWN So and you want to be able to make this . 
UNKNOWN I mean maybe it's too much Oh the advanced buttons . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN No uh like I would drawit like this . 
UNKNOWN Let's say this is the side view . 
UNKNOWN That you have a a screen that will come up here , and can go down that way . 
UNKNOWN If you know what I mean . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So that it would come up like that . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay so the buttons are on top here , and you flip it over that way . 
UNKNOWN Yeah or preferably even keep the simple buttons here , and then under the screen even you could put more more advanced buttons . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Oh yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah yeah yeah yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN That's the the more advanced options were uh for the for the menu . 
UNKNOWN Yeah that's good idea . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But you you want okay . 
UNKNOWN F for the L_C_D_ menu right ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN You just want to hide them all ? 
UNKNOWN So w w Oh Activate and th the yeah . 
UNKNOWN The oh . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN No not all because you need most of them , the arrow buttons . 
UNKNOWN But you can hide the okay and the back uh button . 
UNKNOWN Yeah yeah yeah . 
UNKNOWN And the menu button also because when you flip it open and you can maybe even drop the menu button because maybe if you flip it open it will auto activate amauto uh uh automatically . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So okay b but you have t you need some button to flip this open . 
UNKNOWN Why ? 
UNKNOWN You could just make it mechanical . 
UNKNOWN True . 
UNKNOWN True . 
UNKNOWN But you can make a , yeah , you can make a trigger here . 
UNKNOWN You know a simple uh with a Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah and it says menu and it flips open and then you have the buttons to control it , in combination with your True . 
UNKNOWN That's but it's it's not it's not very uh very strong uh yeah if you drop it one time . 
UNKNOWN Exactly . 
UNKNOWN It uh c it can go open . 
UNKNOWN Well yeah the the idea of it was , is that because you close it , you cover the L_C_D_ screen and it won't be vulnerable to scratches or whatever . 
UNKNOWN If you cover it with rubber . 
UNKNOWN An adv an adv and it will be covered in some kind of uh thin rubber layer or something like that . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN And Exactly . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So it can bounce . 
UNKNOWN Exactly . 
UNKNOWN We just have to make sure that the closing mechanism won't break . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , uh It's very no it's very strong . 
UNKNOWN Th it's very solid yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah okay so that that may work . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN That actually will offer some extra protection for the Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay but then we still have the the the thing of the the the shape . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah I was thinking , if if you have your hand , it this is your th Okay . 
UNKNOWN What kind of Harder . 
UNKNOWN Yeah the lower part doesn't work I guess , so maybe you should try it over there . 
UNKNOWN . 
UNKNOWN If this is your thumb , and this is your hand like that . 
UNKNOWN With your uh wrist . 
UNKNOWN That you , that it would be kind of shape like this , you know . 
UNKNOWN So it's easier to hold in your hand , to y f Uh yeah . 
UNKNOWN But when you are left-handed , that's that's a problem . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah of course . 
UNKNOWN Yeah then w then you would have to to make it like this . 
UNKNOWN Maybe can design two versions . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But that's that's very expensive uh Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Like like you drew here . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And maybe th then make this thicker also than the centre . 
UNKNOWN Give it I would give it a female shape but uh yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN And ergonomical shape . 
UNKNOWN Anyway . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN The female shape yeah . 
UNKNOWN With two uh Oh yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Obviously . 
UNKNOWN We we could make some some rubber uh some rubber uh yeah mouse , with which you can change uh and so if you Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Make it more appealing to guys . 
UNKNOWN I mean Yeah but we have hardware inside , which is so it has to have some sort of basic shape . 
UNKNOWN Some uh k esk uh yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah but but that's optional for later I guess . 
UNKNOWN I mean , we have to make Yeah we we better so choose one Yeah so okay we should better choose one sh one shape . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Some yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah yeah . 
UNKNOWN And also the screen , you cannot mould it . 
UNKNOWN You know kind of thing . 
UNKNOWN No no no no . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But that's the kind of the idea , so it lays good in the hand , and then on on the side with with your thumb , you you can you can use , yeah , you can use the button option Spongey . 
UNKNOWN And then you can You can place the screen here , which can come . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So the keywords are primary co colours , spongey ? 
UNKNOWN And but then I w I would I would do the arrows here , kind of thing . 
UNKNOWN Spongey can be reached by means of Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Those buttons ? 
UNKNOWN And the simple buttons here , so that I Uh y eah that's what I mean . 
UNKNOWN . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And and the and the control thngs in the middle ? 
UNKNOWN The the the arrows ? 
UNKNOWN No the arrow's over here . 
UNKNOWN The arrows over here , and here the s simple uh or do we wanna make its shape look like a banana or something ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah and then numbers . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Buttons . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
UNKNOWN I think that uh it's a nice design . 
UNKNOWN Uh pretty nice design . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It's cool . 
UNKNOWN Yeah it looks uh pretty fancy . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I dunno . 
UNKNOWN Yeah that's Orange or something . 
UNKNOWN . 
UNKNOWN Uh bananas wierd shape and other fruits also , so it's better to have um some sort of basic printand then a fruit printin some primary uh colours . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah we could make We should use Yeah w we need very primary colours , like bright red , bright yellow . 
UNKNOWN I don't know what what colours should the basic printbe like ? 
UNKNOWN Like some soft green or something ? 
UNKNOWN Or and then Oh yeah yeah , dark blue and then and then very bright , uh a yellow banana , an orange , uh a green apple , stuff like that , with very uh bright tones I guess . 
UNKNOWN Or blue ? 
UNKNOWN Dark blue or Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN So you have something like Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah but the primary colours w we can uh create with the with the LEDs on the on the remote control . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah okay yeah . 
UNKNOWN If you we uh yeah . 
UNKNOWN If you make it uh just a yeah bl give it a blue colour , then it's just a neutral colour , also for the for the more uh yeah for the people . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN That doesn't really work . 
UNKNOWN Huh cool . 
UNKNOWN To draw, I guess . 
UNKNOWN No it's . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN What's this ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah it's text . 
CONFIRMATION Right .
UNKNOWN N no you have to exit . 
UNKNOWN Hm . 
UNKNOWN You could also make line with uh Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So that's So that's blue . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Two hours further . 
UNKNOWN thickness . 
SURPRISE Oh .
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN Wh why not go for the twenty ? 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN That's what I call painting . 
UNKNOWN Y Yeah and then on top of that . 
UNKNOWN So that's that's a dark blue basic colour I guess . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It's pretty nice . 
UNKNOWN And then uh Oh Yeah with some some yellow banana Like . 
UNKNOWN Some yellow . 
UNKNOWN Banana colour . 
UNKNOWN And how about some uh some flashing standby lights ? 
UNKNOWN Like you have on the Samsung , well I don't like to call brands phones , the you know that 'cause I remember from one of our first meetings that uh people lose their uh remote controls often . 
UNKNOWN Yeah ? 
UNKNOWN So it not not only in in the colours of the LEDs , that we want something to keep it visible at all times , or Um Yeah . 
UNKNOWN How do you mean ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah if you if flashing colour so you can't lose it , basically . 
UNKNOWN Some some Yeah an orange . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Exactly . 
UNKNOWN Well I think it's a bit too much but Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Maybe a Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well alright well this is more like purple I guess , but it's should be more real dark blue , so the contrast with the with the fruit objects is uh pretty high . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So uh yeah . 
UNKNOWN That would be a nice uh nice device I guess . 
UNKNOWN And which which colour should uh should I give the the display ? 
UNKNOWN Uh Or Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Who ? 
UNKNOWN I mean , the the colour of the background of the display ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Ah well I don't guess it s has to be a sixty uh sixty six five thousand uh colour , so yeah too expensive . 
UNKNOWN And then you can use yellow or semething . 
UNKNOWN Why not ? 
UNKNOWN Aye . 
UNKNOWN So just just a a blue blue backlight or something like that . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Green is too old-fashioned . 
UNKNOWN But blue , blue's okay . 
UNKNOWN As long as you loo use uh high contrast between the the background and the foreground colour . 
UNKNOWN J White backlight , and dark . 
UNKNOWN Yeah maybe a maybe a white a white backlight ? 
UNKNOWN So that people with uh with And also for people who are a bit colourblind . 
UNKNOWN Like this . 
UNKNOWN Dark uh letters , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Whatever which is visible . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I know you sh you should test it under uh under a light conditions . 
UNKNOWN I mean it's hard to tell uh I dunno . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Colourblind yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN True . 
UNKNOWN No so that's mostly red and green I believe . 
UNKNOWN Which which uh colour should the buttons be ? 
UNKNOWN That's adjustable . 
UNKNOWN Woah . 
UNKNOWN Why adjustable ? 
UNKNOWN All all buttons ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah ? 
UNKNOWN Or not . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN No uh But maybe I mean they have to they have to have some colour right ? 
UNKNOWN That's how we are going to make it uh more trendy . 
UNKNOWN Or is it uh too expensive ? 
UNKNOWN It's difficult . 
UNKNOWN And if the background is very dark blue Yeah ? 
UNKNOWN Blue . 
UNKNOWN Maybe green . 
UNKNOWN But don't we wanna make the background the the bright colo colours ? 
UNKNOWN So th the total of the thing is very bright ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah you can Mm-hmm flashy . 
UNKNOWN Like the pictures I showed you guys . 
UNKNOWN Those things were all like like bright red , bright red , flashy . 
UNKNOWN So more like Doesn't work very well . 
UNKNOWN Mm bzz . 
CONFUSION Uh . 
UNKNOWN More like this colour . 
UNKNOWN Yeah something like that , something that stands out more . 
UNKNOWN And then then yellow and orange and red objects on it or something . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But then then again , which colour should the buttons be ? 
UNKNOWN The the press buttons . 
UNKNOWN Should they be white or black or Uh Yeah but it's pretty fresh , on the other side . 
UNKNOWN Red maybe . 
UNKNOWN And it it looks quite cheap , that colour I think . 
UNKNOWN Black . 
UNKNOWN It's it's not Yeah . 
UNKNOWN The green ? 
UNKNOWN Why ? 
UNKNOWN I dunno . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So Ooh . 
UNKNOWN It's actually a pretty trendy colour at the moment . 
UNKNOWN It's it's trendy okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But Mm . 
UNKNOWN My couch is in that colour . 
UNKNOWN . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well it works pretty well . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And then time was up . 
UNKNOWN Uh not yet . 
CONFUSION Uh . 
UNKNOWN Do you get a pop-up if we Alright . 
UNKNOWN Yeah within five minutes yeah . 
UNKNOWN That you have five minutes left or So something like this . 
UNKNOWN Y left yeah left and then uh I have to kick you out . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN That should be pretty nice colour . 
UNKNOWN But maybe the buttons , all buttons in red is maybe a bad contrast for colourblind people . 
UNKNOWN Yeah yeah . 
UNKNOWN No that's actu Red and green are actually the b the easiest to discriminate . 
UNKNOWN Because the of the green . 
UNKNOWN But the but the buttons have their own LEDs or not ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN They have LEDs but they have a colour . 
UNKNOWN Even for colourblind . 
UNKNOWN Yeah ? 
UNKNOWN They will see one of each as grey . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But if you use uh green on blue , those kind of colours will look the same . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN I think . 
UNKNOWN So red buttons are okay ? 
UNKNOWN I think so . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN That that's a default uh setting . 
UNKNOWN You can make them red . 
UNKNOWN The the red buttons . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But I think you need to keep in mind that the LEDs are just extra light . 
UNKNOWN How do you mean ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh they they don't determine the colour that much , I think . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah I I was think about a red uh red LEDs and blue LEDs and Yeah . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause you have to printon them you have a background . 
UNKNOWN No that's that's too busy I guess . 
UNKNOWN Each number is transparent . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh partly but you have to printon the number . 
UNKNOWN Or the the sign . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So you can't change the colour so Yeah . 
UNKNOWN You better bet better better keep the LED and the button itself in the same colour I guess . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So just an extra bit of light and attention . 
UNKNOWN Bit of light . 
UNKNOWN You can what we should do I think is is make kind of a see-through plastic button , with uh one coloured LED behind it . 
UNKNOWN Bit of feedback . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So that the whole button will shine as the colour the And if you think about easy to use buttons , we have to , well we have to make it the shape so that it's easy to hold f for both hands , but also that you can reach the buttons with your thumb , if you hold the machine . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay with Uh Don't mean to discourage you but uh basically you two are going to work on the smartboard . 
UNKNOWN Next thirty minutes to design something so And the You will do the evaluation . 
UNKNOWN Ah , right . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
UNKNOWN Of the product ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Which we don't have yet . 
UNKNOWN Yeah uh about Yeah I don't know . 
UNKNOWN So wh how should I do that ? 
UNKNOWN Oh okay . 
UNKNOWN You probably get a mail. 
UNKNOWN Or you you or you send it to me . 
UNKNOWN Or just because you are going to design it on this board right ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Once they are finished . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah but maybe you can do the evaluation you don't have to evaluate yet but you can make a procedure which to follow . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I don't know . 
UNKNOWN I I probably get instruction on that , how to do that , so I make another presentationI guess . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I kn I know what's gonna happen in in yeah so I've a basic idea . 
UNKNOWN About . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN You have the basic idea . 
UNKNOWN And you two uh are going to do this . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So we're gonna work here ? 
UNKNOWN Look-and-feel and Yeah . 
UNKNOWN On this sketchboard ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Good luck . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
CONFIRMATION Thanks . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Alright so that's uh Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So I uh make new pageand uh be creative . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
UNKNOWN But we have to do it at this moment , after th this meeting ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah you have uh thirty minutes . 
UNKNOWN Thirty minutes . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Then we have to uh see something which we can uh show to the management . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
UNKNOWN Ah so this is basically the what what we are thinking about ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Shall we uh make a new uh Yeah , I just make a new one . 
UNKNOWN I would yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah l let's just uh delete all these uh or Oh , next . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Next . 
UNKNOWN . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
UNKNOWN Oh and save this uh board . 
UNKNOWN Huh ? 
UNKNOWN Just save it . 
UNKNOWN Yeah I'll just I'll just keep it there . 
UNKNOWN Yeah okay but just press save and uh It'll be fine . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN On the left . 
UNKNOWN S so , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh sorry . 
UNKNOWN You can also include clip-art . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Current colour ? 
UNKNOWN So if you'll rather drawin paint or something then look . 
UNKNOWN So um Shall we make some outline sketches of the basic shape first ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Uh Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Because I I Yeah 'cause I have to uh focus on the on the basic look-and-feel design . 
UNKNOWN And then after that we can make the user uh inter interface . 
UNKNOWN This ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So how it's gonna look . 
UNKNOWN And you have to think uh how we're gonna put the screen in it and those kind of things . 
UNKNOWN Uh pretty accurate . 
UNKNOWN So if I'm drawingand you think okay I'm not gonna be able to put a screen in there , you have to correct . 
UNKNOWN Oh we skip this I guess . 
UNKNOWN Sound button press . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN Uh do you mind if I drawin black then ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN You can also include it . 
UNKNOWN It's not much work . 
UNKNOWN For normal sketches . 
UNKNOWN Light only button user ca user interaction . 
UNKNOWN Oh no it's it's okay . 
UNKNOWN so we kind of want the girlish figure . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN That's included . 
UNKNOWN Yeah okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So the pl the plastic plastic buttons also help uh because of um they are only lit during interaction . 
UNKNOWN I'm not so good at drawing. 
UNKNOWN So Well it's a good thing that the buttons aren't um , well that they are plastic , because then you can light up the light on when when they are usable . 
UNKNOWN Excuse me ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN No uh uh . 
UNKNOWN Maybe you should drawit very large like this . 
UNKNOWN Yeah but this part isn't uh functioning properly . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Sensitive . 
UNKNOWN Oh right . 
UNKNOWN How do we uh uh or insert text ? 
UNKNOWN Erase ? 
UNKNOWN I dunno . 
UNKNOWN Maybe just start typing . 
UNKNOWN It's a bit uh large . 
UNKNOWN Oh that's a bit big . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN You also do the other sides . 
UNKNOWN Not only on the front si uh the top side but also the the side view . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Ex exactly . 
UNKNOWN . 
UNKNOWN L let's make first the the the all the views . 
UNKNOWN Uh Uh I thought for the side view , that the w the basic section would be rather uh a bit thicker than the middle , where you're holding it with your 'cause your fingers have to fit underneath and Exactly but the uh but the upper side has to be a bit more like that I think . 
CONFUSION Uh . 
UNKNOWN The the front view , side view and the back view . 
UNKNOWN Jesus . 
UNKNOWN What do I write down ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Why can't I work here ? 
UNKNOWN This is much easier . 
UNKNOWN Much easier , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN The middle has to be very small so you can have it in your hand . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN I don't see a sign that the meeting is over yet but Yeah . 
UNKNOWN No so I just work here a few minutes . 
UNKNOWN Yeah the display , we yeah we can put a display . 
UNKNOWN Uh don't you think ? 
UNKNOWN So the display we will put in here , the basic uh functions in here , where it's most reachable . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN The The th Exactly . 
UNKNOWN The the arrow functions . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN This is hard . 
UNKNOWN What do don't have to drawit exactly do we ? 
UNKNOWN No it's it's uh it's okay . 
CONFUSION Wait .
UNKNOWN Let me try it one more time . 
UNKNOWN Maybe I've uh it's easier if I drawit in once . 
UNKNOWN Okay , of course it will become way more ugly . 
UNKNOWN You can make it m larger . 
UNKNOWN Maybe it's easier to to drawuh Yeah that's that's the basic idea . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN This'll take forever . 
UNKNOWN It's fun to work with this pen . 
UNKNOWN Um so , larger . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN Wrong one . 
UNKNOWN And yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So side . 
UNKNOWN Five minutes left before the meeting ends . 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN Um other views ? 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
UNKNOWN Yeah only if you are going to put buttons on the side of the unit . 
UNKNOWN Uh Yeah . 
UNKNOWN That's the question . 
UNKNOWN But we we I is it if if this is from the side woah . 
UNKNOWN Let's fill i fill in the buttons later . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So this is gonna be from the uh from yeah yeah . 
UNKNOWN From the Yeah I'm I'm May maybe it's it's easier to to integrate the the the L_C_D_ screen just into this this bubble . 
UNKNOWN Steady . 
UNKNOWN Sorry . 
UNKNOWN Because there the screen goes up like that right ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So then it's like this , or that's not convenient because then you have the screen like this and look like the it's better to have it somewhat like this . 
UNKNOWN Yeah ? 
UNKNOWN Or does it flip all the way ? 
UNKNOWN The the idea is that it has to flip up to here . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Because it do doesn't have to flip then . 
UNKNOWN Because we have en enough space for for making a an L_C_D . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah yeah yeah . 
UNKNOWN Because here But why why do we need uh the flipping uh Okay . 
UNKNOWN It's better to to have this like this I guess , and then flip it like this . 
UNKNOWN True . 
UNKNOWN you can adjust the angle to which it flips . 
UNKNOWN So it can also from this angle , it can flip all the way up to there . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN You can flip it up to there if you want . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So w yeah . 
UNKNOWN But we still keep the flipping mechanism . 
UNKNOWN Think so . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah we keep the flip ? 
UNKNOWN Keep the flip live . 
UNKNOWN Yeah because I think it will feel weird if you would make this smaller and this bigger or something that I dunno . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh the the shape is okay but yeah ? 
UNKNOWN I don't see the the yeah why why we should use the the flipping uh mechanism . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I thought it would be cool . 
UNKNOWN Because we Okay yeah . 
UNKNOWN It's it's for for for more trendy uh Because we have enough space . 
UNKNOWN Yeah but maybe Yeah but maybe we we should then Yeah there the middle Sh sh shouldn't we integrate it ? 
UNKNOWN H here we got uh the basic functions , the the arrow uh yeah button . 
UNKNOWN Yeah and then h we sh mm . 
UNKNOWN And then like i oh th doh . 
UNKNOWN Come on . 
UNKNOWN So this is the shape . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN It hasn't Okay but the screen is a bit lower because if it falls on the other side , it doesn't fall on the screen . 
UNKNOWN . 
UNKNOWN It doesn't aim so well . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , then it's No flipping or you wanted the flipping so But if you if you If you drop it it it just breaks . 
UNKNOWN So there's a layer of rubber on the side . 
UNKNOWN Yeah yeah yeah . 
UNKNOWN Definitely . 
UNKNOWN So no flipping but just no . 
UNKNOWN No flipping ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah I guess but uh I mean most votes count right ? 
UNKNOWN And it has to be very strong because of the . 
UNKNOWN Yeah kind of And it's also for the for the children , it's yeah for people not sixteen years . 
UNKNOWN Throwing and the kinetics . 
UNKNOWN It's shaking . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN We better make we better make it like this . 
UNKNOWN Yeah true true . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Eventually . 
UNKNOWN Yeah just light on top . 
UNKNOWN Yeah if you if you're going for the kinetics Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Safer . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Uh they are responsible enough to have a mobile phone , so also to to deal with their uh remote uh control . 
UNKNOWN But there are more Yeah okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah okay that the target group . 
UNKNOWN That's true . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah ? 
UNKNOWN Well . 
UNKNOWN I'm just thinking totally different designsalso . 
UNKNOWN I just uh ended the meeting . 
UNKNOWN You two go design . 
UNKNOWN Okay wi Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Remember that the weird pocketphone thingy which looked like kind of a Gameboy . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN By the way . 
UNKNOWN Um I uh thought up a name for our product . 
UNKNOWN Maybe we should try something like that . 
UNKNOWN But yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah ? 
UNKNOWN Oh right . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It's called uh the Real Remote . 
UNKNOWN Ooh . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
UNKNOWN With a copyright sign after Real . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN The Real Remote . 
CONFIRMATION Alright . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I like it . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So maybe you can include that somewhere . 
UNKNOWN Good . 
UNKNOWN This can go . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN We should work in our own room right ? 
UNKNOWN Or not ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Oh yeah we have to f uh include that in our design as well . 
UNKNOWN I don't see any power cables here so 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN Let's see . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN What the hell's that ? 
UNKNOWN See you two in half an hour uh 
UNKNOWN I think uh it's the sensors . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Uh Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Good luck . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN Okay that's the side . 
UNKNOWN Ah it's it's okay . 
UNKNOWN But do we want uh options on the on the side with the with the buttons ? 
UNKNOWN Or just leave it ? 
UNKNOWN I think we do . 
UNKNOWN Uh could make an uh a volume button uh scroll , volume button . 
UNKNOWN Yeah or j or also scrolling for the m yeah . 
UNKNOWN For menu . 
UNKNOWN Yeah ? 
UNKNOWN Or Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I dunno . 
UNKNOWN We w kind of wanted to stick with the Yeah I'm just thinking , if we i we wanna make something different right ? 
UNKNOWN No , yeah . 
UNKNOWN So the with the scroll is is more futuristic than the standard arrow buttons . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah you are going to design it so . 
GREETING Hi . 
GREETING Hi . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN Good morning . 
UNKNOWN Good morning . 
UNKNOWN Morning . 
UNKNOWN Good morning . 
UNKNOWN Uh before I start with the with the meeting I have a few things to tell you about the the setting we're in , uh because we're uh being watched by uh Big Brother . 
UNKNOWN So um Yeah . 
UNKNOWN By Big Brother ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN This uh These are cameras , so are these . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN This thing uh that looks like a pie , are actually all microphones . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So you must be careful with uh with uh all this . 
UNKNOWN And uh as I can see you uh you have placed your laptops uh exactly on the place where it must be . 
UNKNOWN And that has to do with the camera settings , so we don't have our uh laptops in front of the cameras . 
UNKNOWN Of our faces . 
UNKNOWN And Indeed . 
UNKNOWN So they can see our faces . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Welcome at the kick-off meeting . 
UNKNOWN My name is uh Danny Wolfs . 
UNKNOWN Uh this is the agendafor today . 
UNKNOWN Uh first a little opening . 
UNKNOWN Uh I will introduce myself , uh and uh I think it's very uh good to introduce uh yourself . 
UNKNOWN Uh then uh a little bit of acquaintance , acquaintance to uh to to ourselves . 
UNKNOWN So uh we get to know each other . 
UNKNOWN Uh that will be done uh with a tool training from the he these two uh smart boards . 
UNKNOWN Then the project plan . 
UNKNOWN What we're going to do , and how we're going to do it . 
UNKNOWN Uh and discussion about that and a little closing at the end . 
UNKNOWN Okay uh , my name is uh Danny Wolfs . 
UNKNOWN I'm the Project Manager . 
UNKNOWN What's your name ? 
UNKNOWN I'm Juergen Toffs . 
UNKNOWN I'm the User Interface Designer . 
UNKNOWN User interface , okay . 
UNKNOWN Hi , my name's uh . 
UNKNOWN I'm the Industrial Designer . 
UNKNOWN Industrial , yes . 
UNKNOWN I'm uh Tim . 
UNKNOWN Um my function is the Marketing Expert . 
CONFIRMATION Okay , thank you . 
UNKNOWN First a little about the project aim . 
UNKNOWN Uh the the the aim is to make a new remote control . 
UNKNOWN Uh maybe you have read uh read the website . 
UNKNOWN It's a very uh , yeah , very uh ambitious uh company . 
UNKNOWN They uh they wanna do something else . 
UNKNOWN I w Uh there must be a new remote control . 
UNKNOWN Uh first of all uh it must be original , uh and trendy . 
UNKNOWN That's two things really uh close to each other . 
UNKNOWN But at the same time uh user-friendly . 
UNKNOWN And they have uh Yeah , that's uh very important uh for them . 
UNKNOWN Uh there are three stages . 
UNKNOWN There is a functional design . 
UNKNOWN So uh what are we going uh to uh to do ? 
UNKNOWN What are we going to uh uh make f uh kind of functions in the remote ? 
UNKNOWN And why are we going to do it ? 
UNKNOWN Then the conceptual design . 
UNKNOWN How are going to do it ? 
UNKNOWN And that's uh really global . 
UNKNOWN Uh because at the detailed design , how , part two , uh we go uh to dig in uh really about how the the te the technical of If it's uh it's possible technical-wise . 
UNKNOWN Uh each stage is uh uh is broken up in two uh two stages , individual work and a meeting . 
UNKNOWN So it's uh it's very straightforward . 
UNKNOWN Okay , the tool training . 
UNKNOWN We have two smart boards . 
UNKNOWN This one is for the presentations, the PowerPointpresentationsor the Word presentationof whatever you uh you had . 
UNKNOWN Uh and this is uh only for uh drawing. 
UNKNOWN So uh we uh must let it uh stand on this uh this programme . 
UNKNOWN This is called a smart board thing uh Yeah , it speaks for itself . 
UNKNOWN Speaks for itself . 
UNKNOWN Um and as you uh may have heard , the documentsin the shared folder uh can be uh showed on this screen . 
UNKNOWN Not in y the the My Documents. 
UNKNOWN So if you wanna show something , put it in the shared folder . 
UNKNOWN Uh This uh is very straightforward , with the save , the print, the undo , the blank , the select , the pen . 
UNKNOWN Well , I don't uh gonna explain it all , because I think you know uh how it works . 
UNKNOWN Um we must not forget uh everything we drawon here , uh all must be saved . 
UNKNOWN We we may not delete anything . 
UNKNOWN So uh if you have uh drawn something , save it . 
UNKNOWN Never delete it . 
UNKNOWN That's a very important uh thing . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Uh little uh little kinda exercise to uh know each other . 
UNKNOWN At uh the white board on the left . 
UNKNOWN Every uh every one of us uh must drawour favourite animal , and uh tell uh tell us why we uh had uh chosen that animal . 
UNKNOWN Uh important is that we use different colours , and uh different pen widths . 
UNKNOWN Widths . 
UNKNOWN Widths . 
UNKNOWN I have a question . 
UNKNOWN Yes ? 
UNKNOWN Um this exercise , um did the company board tell you to do it , or uh did you just make it up yourself ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN No no no . 
UNKNOWN It's uh it's uh I I I must do it . 
UNKNOWN It's part of the introduction , okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah , yeah . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause we uh really don't know each other , and uh it's kinda new . 
UNKNOWN So getting used to each other , we can uh have a little fun then , before we uh dig in really to the hard stuff . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN That kind of thing . 
UNKNOWN Would you start with drawingyour uh favourite animal ? 
UNKNOWN Um , yeah . 
UNKNOWN I don't know really how it works . 
UNKNOWN But maybe you can show us first ? 
UNKNOWN Okay , okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , okay . 
UNKNOWN Drawinggoes with uh this thing . 
UNKNOWN Do not touch your hand on uh this little uh thingy here . 
UNKNOWN That's uh important . 
UNKNOWN So hold it uh like this . 
UNKNOWN You g you get electrocuted or It's like Pictionary ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , kinda . 
UNKNOWN So , um You must p p uh push a little uh Good . 
UNKNOWN Because And uh wait uh wait a few seconds . 
UNKNOWN It's not uh fully real-time , so uh watch it . 
UNKNOWN Ach . 
UNKNOWN Oh yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well I'm gonna paint in the red . 
UNKNOWN Ooph . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN That's the background colour . 
UNKNOWN Well , undo . 
UNKNOWN Um The pen ? 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN One minute please . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's the one . 
UNKNOWN Well , five . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN My favourite animal huh ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , you can guess what it is . 
UNKNOWN The the one who says it first gets a raise . 
UNKNOWN May uh paint uh next . 
UNKNOWN It's a pork ? 
UNKNOWN No , it's not an orc . 
UNKNOWN You don't see it uh at the ears ? 
UNKNOWN Mm yeah , I have it at home . 
UNKNOWN You have an orc at home ? 
UNKNOWN Very artistic . 
THANKS Thank you . 
UNKNOWN So it's a cat . 
UNKNOWN What's it called ? 
UNKNOWN Simba . 
UNKNOWN Ah . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause uh we have a cat at home and he's called Simba . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause he looks like the uh the the lion from The Lion King . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Miniature size ? 
UNKNOWN So we uh found it kinda cool to uh name it after a lion . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN He's happy with us , so uh he's smiling . 
UNKNOWN Wow . 
UNKNOWN He does have body uh Huh . 
UNKNOWN No , only the face . 
UNKNOWN Because we have we have twen twenty five minutes . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So we uh Yeah . 
UNKNOWN We have to speed up . 
UNKNOWN Remember you use uh different colours , and different pen widths . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay , who wants to go next ? 
UNKNOWN I Okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah ? 
UNKNOWN So choose a colour , choose a pen width and drawa Yeah . 
UNKNOWN You don't have to change the colour and the pen width during uh the drawing. 
UNKNOWN Save it . 
UNKNOWN Or You have to drawuh push hard on the pen or uh Oh . 
UNKNOWN You have to save it . 
UNKNOWN Save it , okay . 
UNKNOWN I've done it . 
UNKNOWN New ? 
CONFIRMATION 'Kay . 
UNKNOWN Mm uh Not really . 
UNKNOWN Um That one . 
UNKNOWN Kind of firm touch . 
UNKNOWN Uh hmm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Open . 
UNKNOWN Which one is it ? 
UNKNOWN Smart board ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And now ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Okay , thanks . 
UNKNOWN 'Kay , I've speed up . 
UNKNOWN 'Kay , that's fine . 
UNKNOWN Line width . 
UNKNOWN By the way , why was your cat uh red ? 
UNKNOWN Because uh my cat is red uh at home . 
CONFIRMATION Oh , okay . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN And I have red hair , so uh must be red . 
UNKNOWN It's a very bloody cat . 
UNKNOWN Oh , yeah , sure . 
UNKNOWN It's a frog . 
UNKNOWN No , it's a turtle . 
UNKNOWN Uh it's an apple . 
UNKNOWN It's not an apple . 
UNKNOWN Must be a dog . 
UNKNOWN A dog ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Colour . 
UNKNOWN Something like this . 
UNKNOWN Smaller . 
UNKNOWN Huh ? 
UNKNOWN Oh , it is a turtle . 
UNKNOWN It is a turtle . 
UNKNOWN Why a turtle ? 
UNKNOWN Why ? 
UNKNOWN Tim ? 
UNKNOWN Um 'Cause I liked Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles . 
UNKNOWN You watched it a lot ? 
UNKNOWN Uh ? 
UNKNOWN You watched it a lot ? 
UNKNOWN It's uh inside its shell . 
UNKNOWN You'll be uh finished sooner . 
UNKNOWN No , it's uh No no . 
UNKNOWN It's a scared turtle . 
UNKNOWN It's coming up . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
CONFUSION Uh . 
UNKNOWN Wow . 
UNKNOWN Okay , Tim . 
UNKNOWN Something like this . 
THANKS Thank you . 
UNKNOWN Okay , you know Very artistic . 
UNKNOWN Jurgen , you want to go next ? 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah ? 
UNKNOWN Wha Thank you . 
UNKNOWN Here you go . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um How did it work ? 
UNKNOWN Format ? 
UNKNOWN Performance ? 
UNKNOWN And then you have the the current colour , you can change . 
UNKNOWN So no red or green . 
UNKNOWN And a pen ? 
UNKNOWN And uh line uh width . 
UNKNOWN I had five . 
UNKNOWN Tim had Uh Tim , what kinda line width did you have ? 
UNKNOWN Um Well , very good . 
UNKNOWN Uh the big lines were like nine . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN It's a dog . 
UNKNOWN I just uh thought I'd pick the easiest one . 
CONFUSION Uh . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Why a dog ? 
UNKNOWN You have a dog at home ? 
UNKNOWN Well , we had a dog , a few years ago . 
UNKNOWN Uh , it's p It's pretty good uh An artist . 
UNKNOWN Had a dog ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah ? 
UNKNOWN And and it , yeah , when it died we didn't get a new one or something . 
UNKNOWN Ah . 
UNKNOWN But uh Uh a Graphical User Designer , so Hey . 
UNKNOWN You have an artistic uh inner middle . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Think you uh picked the wrong uh function . 
UNKNOWN Wrong job . 
SURPRISE Oh .
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN Can work together . 
UNKNOWN Ah colour . 
UNKNOWN So I think you can see it's real uh really a easy programme to use . 
UNKNOWN Not difficult at all . 
UNKNOWN Wha That's enough , thanks . 
UNKNOWN Well , it's okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay , thank you . 
UNKNOWN Janus ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , sure . 
UNKNOWN The last one ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh thanks . 
UNKNOWN I wonder . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN After a cat , a turtle and a dog . 
UNKNOWN I think he's gonna drawan elephant . 
UNKNOWN I figure I should do something like that , but I'm gonna do something much more difficult . 
SURPRISE Uh-oh . 
SURPRISE Uh-oh . 
UNKNOWN Oh , he is the artistic design . 
UNKNOWN I'm gonna design a remote uh remote control animal . 
UNKNOWN Remote control animal . 
UNKNOWN Exactly . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN Uh Yes . 
UNKNOWN Sorry . 
UNKNOWN Well with the interface , it might be easier to ha to drawhere and display there uh . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN That that might be easier . 
UNKNOWN But at the other hand , uh a pen like that is easy to hold in your hand , and I think it's easier to draw. 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN Better to drawwith a with But what is he uh ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN With a pen than with a mouse mouse . 
UNKNOWN Than on the , with Yeah , I m I mean like uh like on here , drawingdrawinguh . 
UNKNOWN Mouth . 
CONFIRMATION Oh , okay . 
UNKNOWN And then displaying on screen , but Too expensive , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN W with this paperit's too mu too expensive . 
UNKNOWN Is it a rabbit ? 
UNKNOWN Do you have a rabbit at home ? 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN It's a rabbit with uh broken legs ? 
UNKNOWN A green rabbit . 
UNKNOWN Is it a white rabbit f It's the white rabbit from The Matrix . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , exactly . 
UNKNOWN Okay , then yeah . 
UNKNOWN There , the g white green rabbit . 
UNKNOWN So . 
UNKNOWN He's a little bit stoned there . 
UNKNOWN Uh I figured this is a pretty b good impression of a rabbit . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It will do . 
UNKNOWN Uh uh Uh well . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Finishing touch and then we're going further . 
UNKNOWN Project Manager ? 
UNKNOWN Uh Have you been uh counting the time ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah ? 
UNKNOWN Where does the pen go ? 
UNKNOWN Just uh Uh I figured the rabbit was actually the most uh impressive . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , a little . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Let's go on then . 
UNKNOWN Well , I think the dog is the the most uh artistic . 
UNKNOWN Don't choose for youself . 
UNKNOWN Oh , sorry . 
UNKNOWN That's selfish . 
UNKNOWN Okay , now we're gonna dig into the to the serious stuff . 
UNKNOWN It's pretty abstract . 
UNKNOWN Uh the selling price for the remote will be uh twenty five Euro , and the production cost uh may not be more than uh twenty and a half Euro . 
UNKNOWN So uh from my point of view , I don't think it's uh gonna be very uh very high tech , high definition , uh ultra modern uh kinda remote , for twelve uh fift uh twelve and a half Euro . 
UNKNOWN Uh the profit we must make with uh the new remote is uh fifty million Euro . 
UNKNOWN So that's a lot . 
UNKNOWN We have to sell uh a lot of uh Uh I think uh w when the selling price is twenty five , uh uh you got two million , two million remotes . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , how much is it ? 
UNKNOWN Like how much ? 
UNKNOWN Hundred million uh remotes or something ? 
UNKNOWN Oh yeah . 
UNKNOWN Twenty million . 
UNKNOWN Two million , oh yeah , two million . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But our marketing range is uh , market range is international . 
UNKNOWN So we have uh virtually the whole world we can sell uh we can sell our r remotes to . 
UNKNOWN At least that uh countries which have uh a television . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um So now it's time uh for us to uh going uh to discuss a little uh things . 
UNKNOWN You can think about uh experience with a remote control uh yourself , at home . 
UNKNOWN What you think might be uh a useful uh new feature . 
UNKNOWN What uh what can distinguish our new trendy remote control from all the others . 
UNKNOWN Um so uh let's uh let's uh discuss a little . 
UNKNOWN I'm gonna join you at the table . 
UNKNOWN Well what what's the most uh important thing at a remote control ? 
UNKNOWN Um well I think the most important thing of a remote control is that you can switch channels . 
UNKNOWN And my opinion is you should keep it as basic as possible . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Uh Is it possible to open pen drawings in this uh on this screen ? 
UNKNOWN So not a not a remote control who uh uh which can uh can be used for television and a D_V_D_ and radio and Or just only If you have them on uh I can uh Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think so . 
UNKNOWN Uh but I have some points . 
UNKNOWN Can I show them on the on the big screen ? 
UNKNOWN Maybe ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I can find Uh . 
UNKNOWN Oh , in case you want it This is a dead kind of fly . 
UNKNOWN Between the the the , yeah , the the uh Yeah , be The screens . 
UNKNOWN Screen ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN No no no . 
UNKNOWN Only All the drawings go there , at the left uh Oh , that pen drawings . 
UNKNOWN Uh but um which The ones we made on the Oh , only in Word , okay . 
UNKNOWN Uh no , I think uh when it is uh in Word and you have saved it in the Shared Documentsfolder , you can show it there . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay , I have some uh points from marketing point of view . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um just the standard thing li things like uh intuitive , uh small , fairly cheap . 
UNKNOWN Uh it's pretty cheap , twenty five Euros . 
UNKNOWN Uh brand independent . 
UNKNOWN Um I think , it doesn't have to matter uh which brand your T_V_ or other thing is . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um Five minutes ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Five minutes . 
UNKNOWN Okay , I'll wrap it up quickly . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um I personally think it has to be multi-purpose . 
UNKNOWN Uh most of the remote c uh remote controls are uh just for one purpose . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And uh by making it multi-purpose , it uh has a new feature , adds a new feature to the market , and distinguish from uh from current products . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um maybe some other technology than infrared . 
UNKNOWN Uh I rather find it very annoying um , like when someone is standing in front of the T_V_ then you can't switch it . 
UNKNOWN Um think about um sending it over radio waves or bluetooth . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN That might be a little bit uh expensive . 
UNKNOWN Um And something like an L_C_D_ screen . 
UNKNOWN For what purpose ? 
UNKNOWN Um uh like I said here um Maybe it's easy . 
UNKNOWN It's nice as an added feature feature , that um , when you're on a certain channel , you can see on the L_C_D_ screen uh what programmes are coming up or From my point of view , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So it be uh a multi-purpose uh very technically uh high uh remote ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , it must be really uh innovative , technical-wise ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , it has to be uh Yeah , our company is very uh good in making new innovative uh things . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So yeah , I I agree with you . 
UNKNOWN So i i i i To the current market . 
UNKNOWN We And and the price . 
UNKNOWN So we must focus on things who are really uh really add something to uh to Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Look , you got some cheap uh remote controls there . 
UNKNOWN They just uh Yeah , you got a dozen of 'em . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN But when you enter a new market with a remote control and uh wanna gain market share you have to do something special , I think . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But we have to keep an eye that it's Uh at the beginning of such a project , it's it's it's very uh cool to talk about , well , this would be cool , that would be cool . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh but we must not uh lose uh sight of the the user uh uh friendly uh Yeah okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , of course . 
UNKNOWN But it's But but this is just from marketing uh aspect . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I don't know anything about user interface or design . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN And that's because we have him . 
UNKNOWN And and him . 
UNKNOWN And him . 
UNKNOWN Okay , uh next meeting will start in thirty minutes . 
UNKNOWN So uh you uh will have uh individual actions where I presume uh will be some feedback , uh via the m the mail. 
UNKNOWN Um the the the Industrial uh Designer has to uh look at the working design . 
UNKNOWN Uh the User Interface Designer has to look at the technical functions . 
UNKNOWN So that's the thing we uh discussed . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um one thing uh , we must first agree on uh what we're going to m going to make . 
UNKNOWN Yeah ? 
UNKNOWN Do we Are we going to use um it it for multiple systems ? 
UNKNOWN Or uh We should have some agreement on that before we Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Um wha Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Mm uh I I don't think we have to be , we have to agree on that . 
UNKNOWN Uh I think th that's a pha Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I figure we could get back to it on the next meeting actually . 
UNKNOWN That's a phase further . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Ju just uh make some mock-ups , some some general ideas . 
UNKNOWN Ah okay . 
UNKNOWN And and then we can plan Yeah . 
UNKNOWN We can plan further , I think . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But maybe , because uh you are working on the user requirements , you are working on the technical functions , we uh must uh have a little or kinda uh uh uh How do you call it ? 
UNKNOWN Consensus on the , what we're gonna do . 
UNKNOWN Uh Uh a little plan on on what we're going to do . 
UNKNOWN So you don't uh uh come up with the user requirements who don't fit the the the the technical functions at all . 
UNKNOWN Some basic things we co we want to going to do . 
UNKNOWN Uh I think that's well uh Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Will come in handy . 
UNKNOWN Mm yeah . 
UNKNOWN I don't know . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN You decide . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN You're the Project Manager . 
UNKNOWN W He says Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well yeah , if the technical functions have to be designed , I I've gotta know for what kind of machines they will be . 
UNKNOWN Or do we use it a text screen ? 
UNKNOWN Or uh will it be with uh with bluetooth or Okay . 
UNKNOWN Well , th that's that's really a step further . 
UNKNOWN But if you say uh is it uh uh one way or multi-purpose , that's a Why ? 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Uh tha that's a same step further . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , actually it is . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Why ? 
UNKNOWN Then looking at individual components , so that's actually a f step further . 
CONFUSION Uh . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Like we all have a list of uh things that has to b that have to be in it , or how it has to be like . 
UNKNOWN And then in the next meeting we decide w what it's gonna be . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , we can take it from there . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I agree uh , we can take it from there . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN A And then you s then you can delete uh the o the obsolete uh details . 
UNKNOWN Or edit . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So uh each individually i individually uh must think on what's uh at uh his point of view is the most important . 
UNKNOWN I think . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And uh then we're going to fit uh all the pieces together the next meeting . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I must finish off now , so it's over . 
UNKNOWN You uh will receive specific specific instructions uh by your personal coach . 
UNKNOWN And I see you in uh thirty minutes . 
UNKNOWN Okay , cheers . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
THANKS Thank you . 
UNKNOWN Sorry . 
UNKNOWN Damn . 
UNKNOWN Be careful . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN Success ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN Come up . 
GREETING Hello . 
UNKNOWN Hey guys . 
GREETING Hi . 
GREETING Hi . 
GREETING Hi . 
UNKNOWN I see my bunny is still standing . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN No one drawingit . 
UNKNOWN It's too beautiful . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , true . 
UNKNOWN Uh I figured uh that much . 
UNKNOWN Too wicked . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN A minute please , my uh laptop is uh oh , there it is , thank you . 
UNKNOWN So welcome back . 
UNKNOWN At the functional design meeting um the plan is uh that uh each one of you , so not me but only you uh will uh present uh the the things you worked on uh the last uh half hour . 
UNKNOWN I will uh take minutesand will put uh the minutesthat I have uh at the end of the session in the shared folder . 
UNKNOWN Also the minutesof the previous session are also in the shared folder now , so you can read that uh now or afterwards . 
UNKNOWN Um uh I had an emailfrom the from the management board uh , I don't know if you a al also uh received it , but there were four points uh which uh I think are very important . 
UNKNOWN First one is uh they think that uh teletext teletext becomes outdated uh and internet will be the the main uh focus . 
UNKNOWN Uh second one is also important uh , because it's one of the discussion points of the previous session . 
UNKNOWN Uh the remote control shou should onl only be used for the television , so it uh not gonna it's not gonna be a multi-purpose remote control , so uh that's one thing to keep in mind . 
UNKNOWN Uh second , and I think that's important for the Marketing uh Expert , uh the current uh customers uh are in the age group group of uh forty years and older , but with this uh new remote uh they uh will uh would like to reach uh a group uh younger than uh forty . 
UNKNOWN Uh and uh I think to keep in mind , but not really uh for now is that they uh want the the the slogan and the and the logo uh to uh to be recognised more in the remote . 
UNKNOWN So , we have uh forty minutes , so I think uh not more than ten minutes uh uh per presentationuh each , and please uh use uh all the the the facilities so that you have either SMARTboards , the the Word files , what you uh whatever you want . 
UNKNOWN So uh Tim , can you start ? 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah ? 
UNKNOWN 'Kay , welcome . 
UNKNOWN I have some uh new findings on uh Marketing Expert level , which I will show you . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN The method I used was um giving orders to our usability lab uh to do a questionnaire . 
UNKNOWN Um one hundred respondents were involved and my marketing uh department generated a reportwith a lot of results . 
UNKNOWN Um , these were a couple of findings , first pageof three . 
UNKNOWN Um , we have three audiences of two audiences , I'm sorry . 
UNKNOWN Uh the first one , this scale , from sixteen to forty five age . 
UNKNOWN Uh the second one is from sixty four uh forty six to sixty five . 
UNKNOWN Um , as you can see here , the market share for the first audience is about sixty percent um sixty five . 
UNKNOWN Uh second audience audience is uh thirty five percent . 
UNKNOWN Mm and some interests from the from the age groups , uh it seems like the young users of remote controls really like the fancy uh new technology stuff , like uh an L_C_D_ screen on the remote control , um speech recognition . 
UNKNOWN I don't think that's uh really appropriate . 
UNKNOWN Um , and when you see uh the audience , the age is going up uh Yeah , they don't really want it anymore , at least the new technologies . 
UNKNOWN Second findings out of the questionnaire um are the opinion the opinions uh of the audience about current remote controls . 
UNKNOWN First point is , seventy five percent of the users find the most repo remote controls very ugly , uh and eighty percent of the users would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy . 
UNKNOWN So that's maybe something for the User Interface uh Designer . 
UNKNOWN Okay , third findings . 
UNKNOWN According to the frequency of use versus importance investigation , um following buttons are most important . 
UNKNOWN Um , I will tell something about the way this uh this test was , yeah , done . 
UNKNOWN Um , persons were asked uh what the buttons were uh they use most , how much an hour , and uh in the second table the importance of those buttons . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um , when you multiply them , you get the these three points . 
UNKNOWN Switching channels , um yeah , that's pretty uh pretty normal , that's what you do with a remote control . 
UNKNOWN Um the second , teletext , uh and the third , uh volume controls . 
UNKNOWN Um , I think it's good uh that we know what the user want wants , uh at least the these three points have to be uh very clear . 
UNKNOWN But it's strange that the the manage board the management board said that the teletext will be uh outdated by the internet . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , okay . 
UNKNOWN So that that's strange . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , okay , but uh at the moment uh teletext is Yeah , th the best thing you can get uh on T_V_ , like getting information . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , okay . 
UNKNOWN So uh , when you ask people , what do they use , they use teletext and not the internet on a remote control . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , okay . 
UNKNOWN That's ridiculous . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN That's a ne i it It's a new technology , but it's not incorporated right now . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay , my personal preferences . 
UNKNOWN Um , I think we should aim at the uh audience from sixteen to forty five . 
UNKNOWN Mm , first of all um it's the biggest share , the biggest audience , sixty five percent . 
UNKNOWN Uh second , I think you will get the most revenue from i from it . 
UNKNOWN Um , yeah , people from sixteen to forty five watch a lot of T_V_ , more than uh people who are el uh elder . 
UNKNOWN Um second point , we have to impro improve the most used functions , as I said here , switching channels , teletext and volume controls . 
UNKNOWN Third point um that came out of the uh of the questionnaire , uh people used to uh get lost off the remote controller , so maybe it's an idea for us uh to design ex kind of placeholder uh on side of the , yeah , of the T_V_ where you can put the the remote control in . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's a cool idea . 
UNKNOWN Um , that's about it , I think . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN When you mentioned uh improving functions , what uh what do you mean by that what what are you think about ? 
UNKNOWN Uh not not the r not the functions , but uh it came out that a lot of buttons weren't even used uh on a remote control . 
UNKNOWN Uh , the funtionability . 
UNKNOWN So you can have a remote control full of buttons , a hundreds hundreds of buttons , but if you don't use them , yeah it's Yeah , they have to be on it j just to t to get it done if necessary , but um the most used buttons uh have to be bigger or Yeah , perhaps . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Ah okay , so focusing more on the used buttons . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Could you use perhaps uh one button for multiple functions , like example pressing it in longer makes it switch to an different function for example . 
UNKNOWN Just for the minor functions perhaps . 
THANKS Thank you . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , ma perhaps , just just an idea . 
UNKNOWN Just to get less buttons on the remote control , to make it easier and quicker to learn . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah ? 
UNKNOWN 'Kay , that's it . 
THANKS Thank you , Tim . 
UNKNOWN Uh yeah yeah , I'll go , sure . 
UNKNOWN Janus , can you uh Okay , thank you Janus . 
UNKNOWN Right uh , I'll be uh explaining a bit about uh working design about uh the project . 
UNKNOWN Well uh what I did was I dissected uh uh current remote controls and um I viewed how how they w looked , how they worked , uh what kind of components are involved , and how they are connected together . 
UNKNOWN And uh after that I put up a scheme about how uh these things are organised and I'll show it to you in in a in a few seconds . 
UNKNOWN And I'll explain a bit about uh how it works and how we could uh build one and why I think several possibilities uh that we discussed in the earlier meeting falls off . 
UNKNOWN Um right . 
UNKNOWN Uh well what I did was uh I I checked uh remote controls and the uh remote controls of today are all infrared , not like all probably know . 
UNKNOWN And the thing about that is um the remote controls uh have to act as a T_V_ or uh a stereo or something , and those uh have a transmitter that's also focused on infrared , so if we want to uh build uh mm a remote control uh with Bluetooth for instance then uh the T_V_ should have Bluetooth too in order to communicate , so that would mean extra cost for the user and thus uh that's that wouldn't mean a a cheap uh remote control for us . 
UNKNOWN So that's probably why most controls are still infrared . 
UNKNOWN Furthermore they all have uh a a very simple structure , so that would probably uh mean lower costs and uh i that could mean for us a good thing uh 'cause uh well we we should be able to build a relatively cheap uh a cheap uh remote . 
UNKNOWN Well uh as I mentioned ready , we have some Bluetooth Well it may be possible , but uh I figured it wouldn't be possible in within our budget , but that's not for me to decide , but that's maybe something for marketing to look into . 
UNKNOWN F because uh well my personal opinion is uh is not to do uh Bluetooth or or radio waves , although Yeah , actually I have t Yeah . 
UNKNOWN What do you think about uh incorporating Bluetooth or a radio uh receiver uh in the place-holder next to the T_V_ , connected to the T_V_ ? 
UNKNOWN So it's in the wrong product . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I actually I figured that would be that would be rather nice , but then you'd still have the uh the infrared function . 
UNKNOWN So in in theory you'd actually just move the problem , but uh what I did uh think about was when you mentioned about the uh the cup-holder , is why not uh introduce a speech function like where is the remote . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN If somebody says , where is the remote , then it goes uh beep uh beep beep beep or something , I dunno , maybe uh maybe something to look into , I dunno uh what the cost that something like that would be . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN But it may be uh may be something to explore . 
UNKNOWN Uh I'll I'll just explain a bit of the components . 
UNKNOWN Uh first you have the energy source . 
UNKNOWN The energy source would be a battery , simple uh battery uh that you can find anywhere . 
UNKNOWN I figured that would be best , 'cause when the battery uh stops functioning uh we could just uh use you could just go out and buy a new one . 
UNKNOWN So we didn't and we don't have to do all uh to be too complicated about that . 
UNKNOWN Uh the energy source is connected to the infrared button , but uh the infrared button uh works only via the chip and the subcomponent to uh the switch there is a switch uh between these . 
UNKNOWN When the switch is pressed in a w on this this case it switches a button , when a button is prush pushed in , uh a electric current goes through here , and in uh immediately , a l a bulb lights up uh displaying to the user that something has happened . 
UNKNOWN That's uh that's so the h user won't be um thinking , well uh did the button be pressed , w what happened uh . 
UNKNOWN Or I press button but nothing's happening on the T_V_ , so is is something wrong or something . 
UNKNOWN So that's just to uh to to explain the of to to uh make it clearer to the user . 
UNKNOWN Uh w well the signal goes via chip that's translated into uh electric sig uh electronic signals and then it's processed and then it's sent to the infrared bulb where it will be uh uh received on the receiving end . 
UNKNOWN And those uh interpreted by the device , well in this case the television . 
UNKNOWN Uh well my personal preferences here , well we have to keep it simple . 
UNKNOWN Not too many uh gadgets and functions , just like you said uh well the most users n uh you have a lot of buttons and you u u use you don't use them , so why why should we invent uh w spend more time on those . 
UNKNOWN Uh I I think we should stick by with infrared transmitting and uh no receiving . 
UNKNOWN So uh no input from the television . 
UNKNOWN So I think we shouldn't be uh spending time on um teletext and st things like that , because when you uh want teletext on uh infrared you'd have to build in a receiver too , and so in order to receive the signals from uh what's on T_V_ and such . 
UNKNOWN So I figure that would be uh spending too much money and time and Yes , but what should we uh s I I I f I agree with you , but should we spend money or and time on building a receiver into the uh remote control ? 
UNKNOWN Um , yeah , maybe another problem uh , I think current T_V_s can even send infrared . 
UNKNOWN Huh . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN 'Cause that would be I mean extra components , extra designs, um larger g uh remote control . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN These all uh all stuff that we have to take in account . 
UNKNOWN So I I my personal opinion is no no no receiver at all . 
UNKNOWN Um , well we should uh look into the design and the functionability . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Like I said , uh use one button for instance for m multiple functions , or well uh just hide the few buttons o of switching it open or something , the usual uh stuff . 
UNKNOWN And uh don't overbuild , we shouldn't make a big uh remote control for simple functions , but we we should stick to the basics . 
UNKNOWN So that was my uh my personal opinion . 
UNKNOWN And that was my uh my presentationuh Yeah , but Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Yes , I can go ahead . 
UNKNOWN You do ? 
UNKNOWN The last presentation. 
UNKNOWN Last presentation. 
UNKNOWN You have plenty of time , Tim and uh Janus don't uh talk to ten minutes , so uh take your time . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN If you take your time too long I will uh eventually uh warn you . 
UNKNOWN Well , I'm going to give a presentationabut some of the technical functions of these design and uh usability functions . 
UNKNOWN Um what's my opinion about what's most important to combine the design , technical possibilities and the user friendliness in one , so if you um going to design a remote that looks good , that shouldn't weigh over the uh if it's possible to make , of course , but also the user friendliness , so tha that's that's some of the main points . 
UNKNOWN And another one is um the use um of many functions will will make it more difficult , so use as as little functions as possible or at least don't display them all at once on the same remote . 
UNKNOWN If you have fifty functions you don't want fifty buttons uh t uh to be shown at the same time , 'cause when you visit an internet uh site you don't want fifty links uh to see , but maybe use a hierarch hierarchy uh structure . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN And uh well one of the ideas was maybe uh use touch screen , but s I don't know in how far that is possible , since we are sticking to uh um infrared and and the remote cannot receive anything , but uh we might uh consider that . 
CONFUSION Hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um well , of course I I hope this is all clear to you . 
UNKNOWN If you you can use remote like this with all the functions , many functions , but Well , your thumb is a little bigger than th it than this . 
UNKNOWN You have to be very careful what you push , and um if you're looking for teletext you'll be uh searching for half an hour from uh um yeah well , where is it ? 
UNKNOWN Where the hell he here I guess and , yeah , when you have to uh use something else . 
UNKNOWN So just keep it simple , make clear buttons , easy to use . 
UNKNOWN For example if you want to use a play and back and stop , that's very important . 
UNKNOWN Um well this was because of our last discussion , if multiple machines are used , create easy switch between the machines , but um it's no longer uh applying . 
UNKNOWN Well yeah , I prefer to use it only for T_V_ and um n uh not to give too many options and and if possible , uh the buttons should give a dr direct action , not first select Yeah , and so that's where the difficulties lie . 
UNKNOWN Uh you you just said um uh you wanted to to combine more functions in one , so uh you you want to keep it simple , but I think that if you want to do that , then you can't escape the the fact that there will be buttons uh which give s uh more options than one . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , this so that's the thing you have to weigh against each other . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but Yeah , but Well you d you have to keep in mind that uh several T_V_s uh don't even have a menu structure , or they have a very simple menu structure , so you have to keep in mind that not all uh d not our remote won't be able to work on all televisions . 
UNKNOWN Do we want to use a few options and might not be so or original , or uh multi-purpose as we thought , or do we want to use um many buttons . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN So um weighing those factors . 
UNKNOWN Hmm it's maybe an option uh if you use an L_C_D_ or a touch screen um , that in the middle are the the main keys , like displayed on the Uh yeah . 
UNKNOWN The doesn't . 
UNKNOWN . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , this ? 
UNKNOWN No ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Something like that . 
UNKNOWN Okay , just uh in the middle the general functions , like play , uh channel switching , and then uh at the top or at the bottom , some menus like uh settings or that you can drop down . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but when all the questions I had Do we want to use uh a menu display on the T_V_ ? 
UNKNOWN Or um does have to f everything uh be in remotes ? 
UNKNOWN 'Cause if you use a memory display on the T_V_ , you can simply push uh a more menu and then select the options you want to have and press okay . 
CONFUSION Mm . 
UNKNOWN Uh so that's my recommendation , if you use many options in one buttle button , um display the menu on the T_V_ and don't um use combination of t of two buttons at the same time or pressing buttons three times for five seconds , is too complicated for most users . 
UNKNOWN Nah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I think so too , but and that's partly because um uh a lot of T_V_s have different menus , and when you have a particular menu uh at your device , uh it could be that don't correspond to the menu what's actually on T_V_ . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that will be a problem . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN And that would be uh a considerable problem . 
UNKNOWN So if we have to stick with current technologies and uh um well yeah , the restrictions of what's uh is on the market today , um you should keep it s at this . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Use big clear buttons . 
UNKNOWN Not too many . 
UNKNOWN So maybe we'll loose a few option uh options , but I think i this is more important . 
UNKNOWN Um especially the important buttons , um if you want to switch channel , change your volume , uh use teletext , it uh it has to work at once and more advanced options may be put it s somewhere away on the remote , behind uh a little uh little thing or a touch screen . 
UNKNOWN Not embed Yeah , but then with something like a touch screen could could make more menu up pop up or something . 
UNKNOWN And yeah , if you want to uh uh s put on stand-by or change the channel , that should always be possible to do . 
UNKNOWN Not first change menu options or switch something . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Um , well yeah , as you already told , give some feedback . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN If the user is pushing a button he should know if the television or n at least remote is reacting and not just that the batteries may be low . 
UNKNOWN And um , well , my conclusion is uh is uh less is more , keep it simple . 
UNKNOWN So uh maybe we should just ease down on the functionality to uh to keep it accessible on t because you all know , if there are a lot of function on the the television , some you you'll never know uh and never use , and therefore it's uh important if you want to change the volume or channel that is always accessible and easy and other functions um that are not so important um well you we should consider just not using them or at least putting them somewhere on the remote where they're not in the way for the for the most important functions . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh , I think the idea uh about uh touch screen um is very good . 
UNKNOWN Um , because recently uh I saw news item on T_V_ um about uh new telephones uh for elder people . 
UNKNOWN Um , they have like a touch screen with uh really big pictures on it like uh uh call uh hang-up , um and that's a big ad advantage I think , because one the one hand uh you make the remote control compatible for elder users just by uh scaling up the pictures or something . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN It's uh very visual intended . 
UNKNOWN What was I to say more ? 
UNKNOWN Maybe that's an option . 
UNKNOWN Um keep the primary buttons visible . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh make a remote that fits easily in the hands and for some design issues uh well , put a logo on it and maybe use it uh in some aesthetic uh aesthetic form . 
UNKNOWN But uh th the important buttons m make them always accessible and pushable and clear and maybe use a touch screen , or if that's uh will become too difficult just uh like televi some o older telephones use a l uh maybe it's possible to to flip them open and uh just expand the number of options that are normally visible . 
UNKNOWN Yeah okay , but but if you pick the the idea , the left idea then what's gonna be displayed on the touch screen ? 
UNKNOWN Um Yeah . 
UNKNOWN The extra functions . 
UNKNOWN The extra functions , you uh you just see a menu from system functions or teletext functions , and you just choose one , and then all all the options will become available and you just c s yeah t scroll through them . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but l like menu functions or Ah okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Wouldn't it be better to make just one big touch screen , uh one one small uh touch screen uh applet and uh I'll just make um uh let's say fifteen buttons on it , and uh we have three of those , uh actually just uh menus with sub-menus , with or sub-items , sub-functions . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , I think so . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well um then I'd like to make a proposal . 
UNKNOWN If you make one big touch screen , use the same concept as here , keep the buttons always available and use the lower part of the touch screen for the rest . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah , like like the iPod idea that that we just saw . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN You just have a f a few selected buttons and uh a few menus , and with this idea you could actually make uh several you can also improve uh later on . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN Uh uh I think that will be great . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN So you think it's will be better to have a t kinda total touch screen . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , I think so . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I wou I would actually go for the Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Jirun ? 
UNKNOWN Okay , I agree , but I think it's very important that they always um make the same buttons accessible , so use just for special options a part of the touch screen . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , of course . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And so um an elder designer picks up th the of an elder parents or grandparent picks up the remote from the little child and who's all in the systems functions , you'll have to have the possibility to turn off the T_V_ or to switch the channel without um well using all the menu structures to get back to the primary functions . 
UNKNOWN Yeah yeah yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , I had another uh idea about maybe parental control . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um , like building in uh some kind of PIN code uh which allows uh parents to switch to all channels , uh but children uh if children don't don't know the PIN code , they can't switch to uh violent uh channels or Th there's just Ju just a simple log-in , something like that . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah wh Is that possible to use or no ? 
UNKNOWN That is possible , that well that actually depends on the television , but I think I figure that would be Well , y you s you see the fi uh thing is when you buy a remote , you you set the uh channels , the the channels are different on each te television , they aren't set in a preset order , so uh if you uh lock on a remote , uh let's say channel fifteen , well channel fifteen on this television is different than channel fifteen on the other television , so that would be uh that would be actually the main concern . 
UNKNOWN Well , yeah well , does it have to depend on the television ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well , I think that he means that um maybe by some option uh make sure that um remote control and the T_V_ match , and then after that you can um use some s insert some passwords as being apparent that the children cannot use this uh change the settings of the T_V_ , like colour and then volume and uh Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , th that kind of stuff , but maybe um if you log in first as a parent um , you address the the channels and like uh oh , that's channel fifteen , that's uh vi violent channel , uh m my ki my kids uh I don't want my kids to watch that , then you set the priority to only parents , for example . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN Oh , something like that . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well b but make it a separate option in the menu , so that it's it's dif dis displayed from uh displayed here , so uh parents uh Yeah , you can de display it on the on the old style . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that would b Yeah , that . 
UNKNOWN But Yeah okay , but but yeah , that's just that's an a an added feature . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN But let's not uh go too wide about the those things , that's that why we're here . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , th th those things are nice . 
UNKNOWN It's it's a nice idea , but I think that's we wel later in the stage . 
UNKNOWN I've one little question about um a total touch screen or uh um a p yeah , a partial , uh because I think uh elderly people may be uh not used to uh a touch screen , so they want the the the normal functions like teletext , volume changing , um uh to be uh , yeah , kinda traditionals uh and uh the the the the other functions , the more difficult functions uh to be uh maybe on the touch screen , but to keep this as uh normal as possible , to keep it accessible . 
UNKNOWN Partial . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but but if you display it on L_C_D_ screen with r r really big numbers that's just as e just as easy . 
CONFUSION Uh . 
UNKNOWN I I do Uh I do agree , because well , it's just not the same when you touch a touch screen or when you touch a button , but well we have to look at what's our target uh audience . 
UNKNOWN You can display actual buttons on the touch screens . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's true , that's true . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , it's different . 
UNKNOWN W we are aiming for younger people and they they chose So that's that's probably uh a But they Well they uh they all have to be programmed to fit your T_V_ and that that is bit of a tricky job . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that's true , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , age b below forty . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah yeah , yeah , that's a good point . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN And th those young people , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Y you saw it in my marketing report, they like the new fancy stuff , so A touch screen , like Microsoft al already developed something like that for uh uh multi-media applications . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN They like the fancy stuff , yeah . 
UNKNOWN That's true . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN I th I think we can do that too . 
UNKNOWN Mm Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay , as you can see uh the minutesfrom the second meeting , this one , are uh are done . 
UNKNOWN Done . 
UNKNOWN Uh I've uh added the this uh four things from the management board just to keep in mind . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Um each time I uh I had a sort of uh summary on what you told and uh what you personal think . 
UNKNOWN Uh so that can be uh can be read out . 
UNKNOWN Uh a f a few things I uh I noticed uh were um Moment . 
UNKNOWN Ooh . 
UNKNOWN Uh th the the main points in uh this uh uh in this uh meeting is I think uh how uh it's going to look uh with uh we must keep it simple , but have the opportunity to uh have more options and have them uh hidden or something , so they don't uh you don't have a big uh thing full of uh buttons or uh um and uh the point that uh you uh wanna use one uh controller uh for uh uh hypothetically each television , so you must uh the the the the functions , know , like the menus or the the parental control must be all uh by the done by the remote control and not by the television . 
UNKNOWN I think that's the point what uh we discussed . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , yeah , some of them . 
UNKNOWN The menus uh are not identical for all th for all T_V_s , so you have to display it on one uh T_V_ . 
UNKNOWN Well you can use um when you uh how do you call it , s um synchronized , the um remote and the T_V_ , then there's always , there are always uh possibilities to change the colour and the brightness and the volume and um well maybe we can look out if there's options that the remote um in its memory can see what kinda T_V_ it is , from ah , it's a Philips , this and this and that , and then give the options that are capable the capable from the t Well there are universal d um um remotes and they all have a functionality for all the T_V_s , uh so this wouldn't be a extra feature to incorporate the men menus of these . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but that's not possible . 
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm , mm yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , but you have uh uh an yeah , but you have an international market range , so you have I think a big range of Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Add th that that's an opportunity . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN But No . 
UNKNOWN And it's not too complex to do it . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I actually use one of those when They are they are kinda kinda troublesome , but but the thing is whe when you uh start uh building something like this you have to build a receiver into the uh t into the remotes , because uh in order for the remote to process something from the T_V_ , like uh to synchronise and you have to send and receive , and that's well Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
UNKNOWN Oh um mo no , you can just say uh the c Yeah . 
UNKNOWN No no no . 
UNKNOWN Just build it in . 
UNKNOWN He he he he me he means just just one other thing . 
UNKNOWN Uh , with the current remote controls , the universal ones , um you have to press yeah , you have to press a code for T_V_ . 
CONFIRMATION Yes . 
UNKNOWN In codes , y you you get a b a bookwith codes . 
UNKNOWN You look up , I have a Philips H_ fifty five and it says press code four five five and you press code four five five on the uh in the remote and it displays all your uh menu options . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Oh , okay , yeah , sure , uh Yeah yeah yeah . 
UNKNOWN Oh , yeah yeah , sure , that would be possible , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Now we uh just connect uh the T_V_ type uh to a set of options , in just just in the memory , so that if you yeah , like profile , so that if you uh touch in like uh one four one zero kind of T_V_ uh the memory uh pops up the options . 
UNKNOWN Memory in the in the remote . 
CONFIRMATION Yep . 
UNKNOWN Profiles . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that would be possible . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , sure . 
UNKNOWN I th don't think that's uh that takes a lot of storage space or some just varia variables . 
UNKNOWN No , that wouldn't be uh Yeah , a few variables . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , well um if you look at the um manuals from universal uh remotes , there are maybe um three four hundreds T_V_s at maximum . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN If you have all of them , all the old and new T_V_s summed up , so uh I think uh it is possible . 
UNKNOWN Ah it is . 
UNKNOWN It is definitely po Yeah , firmware upgrade . 
UNKNOWN But , on the other hand on the other hand , uh if you have a remote and buy a new T_V_ that isn't incorporated in the remote New remote ? 
UNKNOWN We have five minutes to go . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well then you have to buy a new one , it's very good for marketing Maybe , or an update , software update . 
UNKNOWN A firmware upgrade or something , but from where ? 
UNKNOWN Firmware update , you say . 
UNKNOWN Ah . 
UNKNOWN Maybe w No m may no , maybe we can incorporate some kind of uh U_S_B_ or a firewire connection , so that you can uh connect it to the P_C_ and download the newest firmware from uh from the internet . 
UNKNOWN That's maybe the cup holder . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well , not everybody has uh has uh a P_C_ at home . 
UNKNOWN Well the most most people have , but not not everybody and Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well , at uh you can go back to the shop and uh they Yeah , ser o and they can download it for you . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , like a s kind of service centre . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , maybe something like service cen Or you could well you could s actually look at the place-holder you talked about earlier , and you could probably uh make a connection to uh an telephone line or a internet connection . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Mm-hmm . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well already digital information is sent t to the the standards , T_V_ uh connections , you can see what's uh programme is on on the new uh channels , so maybe j they we can send that information along with standard T_V_ uh Receiving . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Well then then it's be uh back to the building a receiving uh well uh if it's actually worth it to build it in , we could actually look at into it , but I dunno , it it would be uh bringing more costs uh with with it and Yeah , that would be probably best , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Oh yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Difficult . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN I I think it's uh most cheap or cheapest to just do the updates uh at the service centre or at the shop . 
UNKNOWN Yeah yeah , uh s I think some I think it's good idea , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Like when you when you buy a T_V_ you just ask well I'll Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It's it's it's not a lot of work , just one uh docking station where you put it in , press start , bling bling , updated . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , that would be best , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN You don't buy a T_V_ every week , new teev so . 
UNKNOWN Okay , let's uh save this in the meanwhile uh Um m for which one are we going ? 
UNKNOWN No no . 
UNKNOWN Exactly , so Yeah , my vote goes out to the right . 
UNKNOWN My mistake . 
UNKNOWN Let's vote . 
UNKNOWN That one or uh Your vote and your Okay . 
UNKNOWN My vote too . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And your vote ? 
UNKNOWN Well , I was uh doubting about which one to take , but uh you've convinced me that uh if you di display buttons about the same as they would look on a normal um remote all elderly people will know what to do . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN And also like a clapping uh li like device that uh pops open . 
UNKNOWN Opens up is too difficult or uh Break it , I don't get Oh so Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Flips open . 
UNKNOWN Uh too difficult , um maybe uh it's easier to break it . 
UNKNOWN N yeah . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , th th th that i uh Yeah . 
UNKNOWN It's very sensitive . 
UNKNOWN Like my telephone , it's uh it's sensitive too . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Okay well uh it's almost at the end . 
UNKNOWN So we have now a lunch break , finally , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Ah . 
UNKNOWN Uh after the lunch break uh it's back to uh individual work , once again uh thirty minutes . 
UNKNOWN Uh I will put my minutesuh I have updated them so uh s they're updated in the shared folder too . 
UNKNOWN Thirty minutes ? 
UNKNOWN Thirty minutes , the Failure . 
UNKNOWN How minutes? 
UNKNOWN Uh uh the specifi uh specific instructions for the next uh meeting you will all will receive uh at the uh the the email. 
UNKNOWN I don't think I can uh say much about it , so uh uh wait for your emailand uh hopefully you get it done uh in the in the thirty minutes , and I w will see you after the lunch break and the thirty minutes . 
UNKNOWN One question , uh how late do we have to get back be back here ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah ? 
UNKNOWN Uh well uh thirty minutes . 
UNKNOWN A quarter to one maybe ? 
UNKNOWN Uh , yeah . 
UNKNOWN Thirty minutes lunch break ? 
UNKNOWN Thirty minutes lunch break , yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
UNKNOWN I thought forty five . 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN Forty five ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Uh then would it be uh one o'clock . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Or we we ask our personal coach . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah . 
CONFIRMATION Okay . 
THANKS Thank you . 
THANKS Thank you , uh that was a very uh good session I think , we uh we Uh ye well Yeah , because uh all uh things are uh stored in smart board dot uh X_D_K_ and that's in No . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , is it possible to store this on the share documentsor what 'Kay , save it as an image on the res No , and use an image if possible . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , me too . 
UNKNOWN Save as . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , v But but you can open a from your pr from your laptop . 
UNKNOWN Yeah , maybe . 
UNKNOWN Save as . 
UNKNOWN Export . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN Maybe not export function . 
UNKNOWN Export . 
UNKNOWN Well I can I can uh You all uh have the the questionnaire again about uh the after work . 
UNKNOWN Export H_T_M_L_ . 
UNKNOWN Huh , image ? 
UNKNOWN J_ PEG . 
UNKNOWN G_ yeah , J_ PEG . 
UNKNOWN J_ PEG . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , it's better Yeah . 
UNKNOWN Papersize A_ four . 
UNKNOWN Uh screen size . 
UNKNOWN In this directory . 
UNKNOWN N oh . 
UNKNOWN Oh yeah , it's not connected to the to our P_C_s . 
UNKNOWN No ? 
UNKNOWN Yeah , it is connected . 
UNKNOWN It's connected ? 
CONFIRMATION Yeah , I think so . 
UNKNOWN To room . 
UNKNOWN Deskt Huh . 
NEGATION No . 
UNKNOWN I'll just uh saved in my documents. 
SURPRISE Oh .
UNKNOWN Yeah in my own uh in my own messenger . 
CONFIRMATION Yeah .
